Obviously any woman has the ability to have a lot of sex, more so a queen. The reason why in the age before contraception it was thought to be a bad thing, especially for a woman of nobility, probably stems from the fact that women can only be pregnant to one man at a time. This means that the woman should seek sperm of the best quality that is provided by the best quality men. Sleeping around a lot would imply the woman is having sex with (also) low-quality men (who are also unlikely to stick around as fathers), thus making it possible she'll end up with low-quality offspring. By low-quality men I mean men who would have trouble having sex with women (due to e.g. unattractiveness), which means that any offspring carrying their genetics would also have trouble mating. However, an unattractive man would presumably have better chances with a woman who's more prone to sleep around a lot, meaning that even such men get a chance with a promiscuous woman. For men this would not be such a problem, since a man is not tied to the unborn child in the same way. In the time it takes a woman to bear one child, a man can conceive a hundred more. Thus men wouldn't need to pay much attention as to which field they plow, but women would have to be careful with whose seed they take. Most of this would of course be in our subconscious mammalian brain forged by the eons of natural selection that has driven our species towards this specific  procreation culture.

The bird he passed along the way was the forger's homing vulture, which was en route to the forger's publisher to make a delivery. Unfortunately, the poor bird had to fly down the stairwell to ground level and out the open terrace since the forger's apartment had no windows. She was carrying some rolled up paper on which her owner had written the perfect end to his prized short story, what's delivery was a mission of utmost importance.\n\n>You see, the forger was very proud of this story's ending as it unabashedly mocked the last two novellas in a complete collection written by his far more successful literary rival, Condolyssa Blackburn, who had worked to expose the forger's dishonesty by high-hatting his private dealings in said novellas, of which the forger grew thirsty for revenge. This same short story would later assist the forger in framing her for a homicide.\n\n>So, the swindler in the stairwell knew of the forger's vulture, but he hated birds and went about swatting and cursing at her for flying around in the building. Though, little did the swindler realize that there was a third crook who had been hiding in the shadows of the stairwell above him. As the swindler rounded the corner and came into view, the young thief named Khan had already lept from the banister one floor up behind the swindler as he planned to knock the swindler down and take his money.\n\n>As was indicative of his inexperience, young Khan did not notice the vulture until after he lept from the banister as he was too busy marking the swindler to notice the large bird flying past him on it's way down. The sight of the dutiful bird had caused the swindler to stop and swat and curse, which completely negated Khan's calculated leap, so as he fell toward where the swindler would have been had it not been for the vulture, he joined the swindler in cursing wildly at the bird because she had single-wingedly ruined his plan.\nKhan's midair cursing fit caught the attention of the swindler who sighted him, and since Khan was quite green and merely half his age, the swindler immediately began talking down to him, attempting to illustrate how feeble and worthless his attempt to swindle a swindler. Yet, as the swindler turned to continue his ascent upstairs, his pride had hindered him from noticing that Khan had successfully picked the wallet from his back pocket.\n\n>Thus, Khan's incredibly embarrassing, albeit successful, incident is now humorously referred to among his fellow con men as the \"greatest con ever botched,\" which is far less mentally demanding than what it was formerly referred to as, which was the \"condescending conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending Khan's descending on dissenting conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending Khan descending condescending condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting on dissenting condor-sending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes on descending condescending Khan's descending\" con.", "id": "d28335r"}, {"comment": "So like.

It is usually known as simply, a \"Creation\". In this world, there is light, water, air, mud, mountains, trees, animals, and most importantly, humans. Humans is important because to God, this part of Creation was \"really good\", where as the many other parts were just simply \"good\". \n\nThese humans lived in a place where their God had put them to live. They were also given a set of rules and there were consequences if they broke them. One day, one of the human decided to break the rule and God found out. It didn't matter how important they were to God, God had to be righteous and gave them their punishment. So the humans began to feel ashamed, afraid and pain started growing out of them. (aka sin) They were also kicked out of the place they could have lived forever. ( aka the old heaven)\n\nPart 2.\nIt wasn't long until humans began to populate the world. They still feel ashamed, afraid, painfulness and the worst of all, the genuine relationship they had with their God. One man was righteous enough in the eyes of God that a flood came down and killed all humans apart from this one man and his family. The intention was to make things right through this one man, and hope this time things will go right. However, the shamefulness, the pain and deceit came creeping back into humanity, the plan to start anew did not came successful. \n\nPart 3.\nSoon, the descendants of this one man spread out the whole of the earth. God was close to some of those men and women. Some of these people were so close with God, that they were considered friends, and God even made an agreement with some of them that one day, they and their descendants can be relieved from the shamefulness, pain and lies that keeps creeping back even till this day. It should also be noted, that the Creation and not only humans, were also under this pain and it has been groaning in pain ever since.\n\nIn the eyes of God, these descendants were special. Some of these people, I guess you can even call them Godly men and women. They began to live in tribes and then later they had Kings and Queens.  But it wasn't long until the best of them betrayed God, even though their God had helped them every step to their success in this creation. Thus it wasn't surprising that they were also kicked out of their land (which was also given to them by their God), into the hands of their enemy. There were long hard years as they became slaves of their enemies, before they could return home, but even then things were never the same again. \n\nPart 4.\nGod saw it was right time again to provide a way to relieve the shamefulness and pain of humans, and most of all, to rebuild a genuine relationship with Creation (including humans). God saw that the pain kept creeping back, no matter how righteous some of the \"very good\" humans were. So a part of God (1/3 to be exact) became fully human (as well as in the same time fully God), born into Creation as a human being and it is through this man that shamefulness, pain and deceitfulness could be completely removed, and most importantly, humans can once again have a genuine relationship with God through this man. \n\nThis man gathered a group of people to become witnesses and told them to spread the word of what they had seen and experienced, so that more people can be relieved of their shamefulness and painfulness in this creation through, just simply, believe He really did it.\n\nPart 5.\nThis group of people, told more people and the word spread quickly, even till this day. It has been almost 2000 years since, but they story keeps going. Me and you are in this story together whether you believe in this man or not, but wait, this is not where the story ends....\n\nPart 6.\nIt has been a long time since this man has returned, but this time He came back to finish off where he left off. Everything is about to transition into a new beginning and He has came back to judge those who would enter into this new beginning with Him, in this new place where He will live with descendants forever. These descendants were the same ones who believed He could relieve their shamefulness and pain, and most of all a genuine relationship with Him. \n\nThis is the New Creation, but a \"re-new\" Creation to be exact. New heaven and new earth comes down and replaces the old. Creation no longer groans in pain. This makes sense because when God first created the Creation, it was good. God loves the Creation, it doesn't make sense to just blow it up, or left it empty. \n\nTo summarise, heaven is not simply a boring place with angels and trumpets everyday, while we follow a divine being, blindly 24/7. Creation will renew and we will continue to inhabit this place. The most important difference is that this new heaven and new earth will be without shamefulness and pain. But most of all, there is a genuine relationship with God.\n\nIn hell, there is exactly the opposite of that. There will be eternal shamefulness and pain and those in there will be forever isolated and barred from having a relationship with God. \n\nAll God ever wanted was to rebuild the relationship with Creation that was first intended to be. In fact, large portion of the NT has no direct reference to hell. \n>\"Large parts of the NT present the fate of unbelievers with no direct reference to hell. John's Gospel and letters often contrast eternal life with death and perishing, though they also contain two references to judgment (John 5:29; 1 John 4:17). Acts proclaims salvation with only occasional reference to judgment (Acts 10:42; 24:25). Paul repeatedly refers to the wrath of God, judgment, condemnation, perishing, destruction and death, but hardly ever to what follows judgment (only in 2 Thess. 1:9). And James refers only to destruction and death.\" \n\n- T Desmond Alexander and Brian S.

They came here and got married. As for my mother's side, my great grandmother left Kaunas as a child for some unknown reason (there were no pogroms in Lithuania or Poland, so it's a mystery, but they had to leave in secret). My great grandfather was raised in England after his parents eloped and left Odessa and married my great grandmother in Ellis Island. My great grandfather on my mom's dad's side didn't have trouble in Romania, he just came to Ellis Island for the opportunity. No idea about his side of the family, since he has a really REALLY common Jewish name that I'm pretty sure they adopted in America as a calque because it's German, so I don't know if that side got in trouble with the Nazis. But I'm guessing since Romania was protected by the Warsaw Pact and my grandparents visited them in Iasi (it's right on the border with Moldova, so we probably have some Moldovan relatives) that most of that branch survived. \n\nTl;dr: the ones who stayed behind were killed.

They\nare called prepositions because their position is usually before a\nnoun. Examples:\n\n1. I went *to* the store.\n2. I weep *for* you.\n\nSentences that end with prepositions are:\n\n1. The store is where I went to.\n2. This is what we have hospitals for.\n\nA lot of grammar Nazis erroneously think that it's poor practice to end\na sentence with a preposition. However, the practice makes perfect sense\nin English. The meaning of the sentence is unambiguous.\n\nIn certain other Indo-European languages, namely Latin, ending a\nsentence with a preposition doesn't make any sense. The previous two\nsentences would have to be.\n\n1. The store is the place to which I went.\n2. This is the purpose for which we have hospitals.\n\nIn certain English schools, students were taught not to end sentences\nwith prepositions. I believe it was because they thought Latin was the\n\"perfect\" language, and other languages should try to emulate it.\n\nA **dangling participle** is a sentence part that modifies a noun that isn't\nmentioned explicitly in the sentence. Either that, or the sentence part\ncould conceivably modify two different nouns.\n\nFor instance:\n\n> *Kicking and screaming*, the man dragged the girl by her neck.\n\nIn that sentence, either the man or the girl could be kicking and/or\nscreaming. It's not clear. It's probably\n\n> The girl is kicking and screaming while being dragged by the man.\n\n However, an equally valid interpretation would be \n\n> The man is dragging the girl, while also kicking her and screaming at\n> her.\n\nThe dangling participle is an example of a grammar mistake that is\nactually a mistake.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**Edit**: numerous people who actually know Latin are pointing out that, in Latin, the word order doesn't matter, but there is a \"proper form\" which includes not putting prepositions at the end of sentences.

It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A confit byaldi is a confit byaldi and a dish of the french cuisine. But that's not what you said. You said a confit byaldi is a ratatouille, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all French dishes ratatouille, which means you'd call ragout, tartines, and other dishes ratatouilles, too.

He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.    \n    \nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you.

You're not a monk.\"  \nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"  \n    \nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\n    \nThe man sets about his task.     \n    \nAfter years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.    \n    \n\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"    \n    \nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk.

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.

The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"    \n    \nThe man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!    \nWith trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open.

I will take you down there so you can see it yourself.\"\n\nSo they went down to the vault and Brother John began to read. He missed supper that night and breakfast the next morning.

", "id": "d017i1q"}, {"comment": "Once upon a time there was a kingdom on an island called Trid. Trid was at the base of a mountain, and on the top of the mountain lived a scary fire breathing dragon. One day, the dragon flew down and stole the Princess of Trid.\n\nThe king ordered his army to march up the mountain and rescue the princess. His general refused, telling the king that it was a suicide mission, and he would not send all of his troops to their death needlessly. The king thus went to his scribe and told him to sent out a message to all the men in all the kingdoms: \u201cWhoso ever rescues my daughter from the clutches of the evil dragon shall be wed to her at once and inherit the throne upon my passing.\u201d\n\nThree of the king\u2019s best knights came forward the next day upon their own accord. The king sent the third best of them first, for it would not be such a great loss if the knight failed. That knight had fireproof armor and a sword that could cut through the scales of a dragon. He climbed the mountain path, slaying vicious wolves and dangerous thieves. Eventually, he came to the cave at the top of the mountain. He carefully walked through the tunnel until he came to the dragon\u2019s lair at the end. Immediately he spotted the princess, as the lair was lit by a large hole in the wall. He walked to the cage the princess was being held in, and was suddenly blocked by the dragon! He lifted his sword, but before he could land a single blow, the dragon kicked him out of the hole, and he fell to his death.\n\nThe second knight was selected the next day. He had a crossbow with arrows so sharp they would pierce the dragon\u2019s hide, although he wore no armor. He too made his way up the side of the mountain, slaying dangerous beasts and mercenaries. He eventually made his way down the tunnel and to the dragon\u2019s lair. He looked not for the princess, but for the dragon, and when he found it, he set up his first shot. He let loose an arrow, and missed. Alerted to the knight\u2019s presence, the dragon swiftly flew over, and kicked the knight out of the cave, and the knight plummeted to his death down the side of the mountain.\n\nThe best knight in the kingdom knew it was up to him to rescue the princess. He wielded his dragon-crushing mace as he made his way up the mountain, destroying all of the evilness left after the previous two knights. He made his way to the princess, but right before he was able to free her, the dragon appeared. The knight swung his mace, nimbly dodging the dragon\u2019s kicks, but unfortunately, the knight tripped over a mound of gold, and the dragon kicked him too out of the hole in the wall.\n\nDevastated at the sight of his three best knights falling to their demise, the king fell into deep despair. At the same time, a rabbi from a far away land had just landed his ship upon the Trid shore. The rabbi, simply clad in nothing more than a wool robe and wooden sandals, went to the king and showed him the message he received, and asked if it was true. The king confirmed, but alerted the rabbi that his three best knights had already fallen victim to the dragon. The knight told him not to worry, and that we would retrieve the princess. The rabbi slowly made his way up the side of the mountain, which was now completely free of danger thanks to the knights. He continued to make his way into the cave and down the tunnel, eventually reaching the dragon\u2019s lair. Once he saw the princess, he cried out, \u201cDragon! If you can hear me, show yourself!\u201d The dragon appeared immediately. The rabbit continued, \u201cPlease, great dragon, release the princess! Let me take her home!\u201d The dragon looked at the rabbi, and opened the cage. The rabbi took the princess\u2019s hand and together they slowly made their way to the king.\n\nThe king, astonished, immediately wed the rabbi to his daughter. Several years later, the king passed away, and the kingdom prospered under the rule of the rabbi. As the years passed, the rabbi grew old. Upon his last days, he decided he had one piece of unfinished business before he could pass away happy. He slowly made his way up the mountain again, into the cave, and down the tunnel. When he saw the dragon, it greeted him like an old friend, \u201cHello king rabbi! It has been quite some time!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the rabbi said, \u201cbut I must ask you, why did you give me the princess yet kick the knights down the mountain?\u201d\n\nThe dragon laughed and replied, \u201c[Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CA11vk_X-A&feature=youtu.be&t=22s)\u201d", "id": "d01yy8y"}], [{"comment": ":)", "id": "d00vfjl"}, {"comment": ";)", "id": "d011vo5"}, {"comment": ":o", "id": "d013ikb"}, {"comment": "(\u3065\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\u3065", "id": "d014706"}, {"comment": "Easy there fella, let's not get ahead of ourselves here!", "id": "d014dc6"}, {"comment": "( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "id": "d014q1r"}, {"comment": ":)", "id": "d014d8q"}, {"comment": "(:", "id": "d014o96"}], [{"comment": "There's a whimsical wisdom about this.

Impressive", "id": "d8vc6t7"}, {"comment": "28 year old male here..\n\nLet me instill hope into those of you who believe your excessive-porn-watching has ruined your sexual mentality to ever enjoy sex again while being in the moment entirely. \n\nI began watching porn on my phone almost daily around the age 20. I enjoyed the quick orgasm and the vast selection of women available online to please my fantasy for that day. I also used it as an excuse to fall asleep quicker. I developed these habits without knowing how destructive it would turn out in other areas of my life. Let me explain..\n\nI dated the same girl from age 17 to 26, we even lived together and became engaged during the last 11 months of our relationship (the ring didn't fix a thing).  Slowly, overtime, our sex life became nonexistent because of my pleasure and dependency for watching porn. It became so destructive I would rather her go to sleep in our bed while I snuck into the laudnry room with headphones to watch porn and bust my nut. Wham-Bam, 5 minutes later I was temporarily pleased just like a heroine addict. Even when my ex and I would have sex, I would have to imagine fucking other women just to reach orgasm. How pathetic?!  A joke I once read, \"..All geese mate while thinking about swans\" was hilarious to me.  I turned my head and I began believing this was a way of life for all men.  But subconsciously I knew my habit was beyond terrible; it was a habit most men in our culture bought into as being okay.  Deep in my mind I imagined my future, I would get married and always be dependent on having a good imagination to be satisfied. I  believed there was too much damage to ever be normal again, even if counseling became a reality one day. Needless to say, that relationship fell to pieces.  Over the next two years while I was single, I \"sowed my oats\" and continued watching porn daily while believing I was fulfilling my young sexual fantasies. Instinctively though, I wanted to be better.  Gradually I would take steps in the right direction. I began reading on yourbrainonporn.com and became very aware of the destructiveness of pornography. At one point I felt hopeless and disappointed in myself.  The damage was so bad, I would have to envision other women (celebrities, porn stars, women I knew at work..) just to reach orgasm with the women I would have one night stands with.  I knew I had a problem and I wasn't afraid to admit that to myself anymore. \n\nSo I made the leap, I committed to not watching porn anymore. I consciously made the effort to distract myself and create ways to beat the habit.  I read books such as, \"The Marshmallow Test\", to facilitate my new thinking. I used an app, 'daysWithout', to encourage me to add one more day to being without the old habit. I contacted a good friend and made him my accountability partner to ensure I was remaining on track by having honest conversations with him. And just like any addiction, I made the conscious effort to stop the crave of dopamine being released by my actions; after all, I am in control.  Fast forward to the girl I'm happy with now. When I met her, I knew I wanted to be serious with her and I didn't want this relationship to fail in the same manner my last relationship did so I remained committed to myself by not watching porn.  My girlfriend and I finally had sex on our 3rd or 4th date and wow! It was FUCKING AMAZING!  I didn't have to imagine any other women and I was completely in the moment with her. We've now been dating for about 5 months and I have only been with her (mentally speaking), 100% in the moment. We've had a ton of sex, up to 5 times in the same day!  I'm very satisfied with my progress and I hope to write about this to motivate any other ambitious men with similar desires to follow through with.  I'm not na\u00efve and I understand many of you who have been with the same woman for years and even decades, that you think my relationship is new and \"should\" be this way. \"Should\" is a way of the past. Unfortunately, the honeymoon-phase of many relationships in 2016 probably doesn't last as long as they \"should\" because many of us have become desensitized.  I'm sure in my lifetime I will have other psychological sexual battles I will face, and I'm not sure how I'll overcome them but I'm positive that by not watching porn, will only help me and my future wife's best interests.

Now the reason I say 'great' like that is because it was also the time America started to take on huge amounts of debt to pay for things.\n\nI remember when I was young and stupid and got my first credit card. Well I can tell you the first 6 months was also 'great'. I bought a new TV, PlayStation, hell get a new car, why not. But then the credit card bills come in, you can pay it off of course, but you use your whole pay for the debt then resort to using credit card some more to get by. A dinner out here and few beers there, you're in over your head.\n\nNow America has the biggest debt it's ever had in its existence and for some reason people find it appealing to get another credit card and go on another spree, despite the fact you can't cover interest payments now.\n\nSeriously, how dumb does Trump think people are?", "id": "d081ysp"}, {"comment": "\"Make America great again\" was Reagan's campaign slogan in 1980.

Dealing with those choices, and being honest about all your feelings...well, that's incredibly difficult of course....hence why people believe marriage to be hard work. \n\nAll of the outside influences don't help this belief either. Pressures to compare your marriage to any other, are unbelievable. Are we having enough sex? Are we gonna have a baby? Are we getting a bigger house, or a new boat, or taking that vacation?  \nAdd all of this to people's normal insecurities that float through their daily inner dialogue, and it's a wonder MORE marriages don't end up broken. \n\nTaking that perspective, if bringing others into the bedroom helps you and your spouse get closer...go for it!

Sure there are some people who can forgive, and who's marriages recover and even become stronger....and bravo for them. Most folks just want to kill the transgressor, or curl up and fade away themselves.  Regardless of the outcome, no one ever wants their trust betrayed like that. As people also tend to define themselves heavily by their marriage, and its successes or failures, this not only hurts at a betrayal level, but by shattering their self image, and worth. \n\nIt's not that man/woman CANT or SHOULDNT be in a monogamous relationship, or even that monogamy should be the dominant social coupling...its that too many people get married or into a serious relationship without understanding that question. \"Did I move closer to my partner today, or not?\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], [18, "I'm listening to The Smiths right now."], [18, "Dude, I'm still so very happy that the third guy wasn't in the freezer..."], [16, "^(if he was the statue at the smith's, how did the wife not recognize him when she was there?)"], [12, "So how did his wife end up seeing the Smith's \"statue\"?

English has similar problems, do I mean 'way' or 'weigh'? Or more commonly, you, your, you're, yours. Etc.\n\nTo the untrained ear, this is next to impossible to translate vocally. You have to switch out the actual words used, for some other word that is more common for the other, but may not actually carry the exact same meaning.\n\nThis is why translating is an extremely difficult job, especially if you are taking something spoken and converting it to something written.\n\nBut no, he is right. A lot of the spoken jokes do not translate well if spoken directly.\n\n\"Here's another one from my fat cousin: If I don't fill my stomach, where am I gonna get the strength to lose weight?\"\n\nLet me draw an example from what you wrote; look at the word 'gonna'? That is American English slang, and you converted the joke to English. You didn't actually tell the joke as it was exactly phrased in its foreign language. And that's because it's impossible to, hence why translating poetry is especially hard; word order, word sound, word pattern, letter pattern are all important and help make the joke what it is.\n\nNot all languages depend on the letter order, but Hebrew, for example, is why very, very few Hebrew poetry have been translated to other languages. Even if you can convey the 'word' you aren't conveying the more subtle meaning in how Aleph-Bet-Gimel are arranged. And then it gets even more complicated!

She was kind of drunk and a bit flirty and when I asked her what books she was into she ended up blurting out how she was obsessed with 50 shades of grey. She looked really embarrassed but my eyes lit up and I misinterpreted this as a sign that I should tell her that I spend hours each day curating a bondage pornography blog, with material ranging from the 60's to the present day! And quickly pulled up a page with a list of my top 10 scenes from waterbondage.com.\n\n\n>I then said that 50 shades of grey was like Disney compared to whats out there and if she could jot down a list of her top fetishes and fantasies surrounding bdsm I could quickly run upstairs and burn scenes which exemplify those fetishes onto a 16gb flash drive. I then started jokingly singing a version of Aladdins \"a whole new world\" \"I can show you the world, whips and ropes and baaaall gags, erotic dunk tanks tell me \"Sarah\" whats your fillllllthiest desire?\"\n\n\n>I then noticed everyone staring at me with a \"what the hell\" look and my brother had a dawning \"he's doing it again\" expression on his face and she looked absolutely horrified and said something about how she had to leave and went and grabbed her friends arm and I heard some muffled \"I don't care if we're drunk we'll just call a fucking taxi!\" argument and I quickly realized that she was a normal 20 year old whose knowledge of bdsm didn't go beyond 50 shades and I did the adult \"porn aspergers rant\" version of when I was 13 and met a cute girl whose brother was on the space club with me and she mentioned she liked astronomy and asked what type of telescope she owned and I was soon ranting about how the republicans in America are trying to shut down nasa and how in a thousand years if humanity survives it will be because of men like Carl Sagan and not generals and businessmen who only care about money......\"\n\n\n>Its to the point where I can instantly recognize the \"oh my god, what is wrong with him, he seemed cute and nice at first but now I am fucking terrified\" look on a woman and I immediately know I fucked up. The hard part is knowing to just politely excuse myself and run to my bedroom so I can cry and shake my fist angrily at \"existence\" instead of just pausing mid rant to look at her face and shout out \"FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!\" and then start stomping around in the corner like a fuming Daffy Duck after he just got blown up.\n\n\n>Ended up running downstairs to start a 2 hour angry drum solo interspersed with screams of despair. I actually felt kind of good afterwards, or at least too emotionally drained to feel anything and thought maybe I could salvage the night but everyone in the house was gone. I feel pretty bad about it now since my brother basically organized the party as a way of trying to get me to be more social.\n\nEdit: Holy mother of formatting", "id": "d3e5lur"}, {"comment": "Oh my god", "id": "d3eagsj"}, {"comment": "Holy shit.

I told them they could only vote once and that the meal with the most votes wins. \n\nOne of my children voted for just pickles.   \nTwo of them voted for lasagna.  \nThree voted fried chicken and mashed potatoes.  \nFive voted meatloaf.    \nTwo voted grilled cheese.  \nFour voted liver and onions.  \nThree voted asparagus and steak.  \nOne voted for just ice cream.  \nThe remaining twenty-five of them didn't care and abstained.\n\nOn the first night, we tallied the votes and ate meatloaf.\n\n---\n\nOn the second night, I informed the kids that we were continuing our lesson on American democracy. The same rules applied. \n\nAs the only groups with one vote to their name, the child who wanted pickles and the one who wanted ice cream came to the realization that they would never win unless they could convert other people to their cause. They tried and failed. So they decided that, instead of wasting their votes on pickles or ice cream, they would vote for something else. They realized that if they both voted for liver and onions, that *it* would win instead of meatloaf. They don't really like liver and onions, but they really hate meatloaf. So during the second night:\n\nTwo of my children voted lasagna.  \nThree voted fried chicken and mashed potatoes.  \nFive voted meatloaf.  \nTwo voted grilled cheese.  \nSix voted liver and onions.  \nThree voted asparagus and steak.  \nThe remaining twenty-five of them didn't care and abstained.\n\nWe tallied the votes and ate liver and onions.\n\n---\n\nOn the third night, we continued our exercise in American democracy.\n\nLasagna, fried chicken and mashed potatoes, and grilled cheese all took a page from pickles and ice cream and realized their votes were being wasted. They decided to vote for meatloaf, because they *hated* liver and onions. Asparagus and steak had the same thought, but sided *with* liver and onions. Four of the children that hadn't previously cared what we had for dinner decided that they were going to vote for liver and onions, either because they really wanted them that night or because they really *didn't* want meatloaf that night. So during the third night:\n\nTwelve of my children voted for meatloaf.  \nThirteen for liver and onions.   \nAnd twenty-one abstained.  \n\nWe tallied the votes and ate liver and onions.\n\n---\nOn the fourth night, two of the previously un-preferenced kids returned to having no preference. Additionally, one of my kids who had previously voted liver and onions, decided that she'd had enough and wanted to have meatloaf. One of the original grilled cheese voters decided to give up on voting, because the system I gave them means that we'll never have grilled cheese. During the fourth night:\n\nTwelve voted for meatloaf.  \nTen voted for liver and onions.  \nAnd twenty-four abstained.  \n\nOn the fourth night, we had meatloaf.\n\n---\n\nEvery night, we continued our exercise. Sometimes, a few of the un-preferenced would chime in and tip a meal one way or the other. Occasionally, someone that had been voting meatloaf would vote liver and onions or vice versa. Over time, patterns emerged. There was a core group that was always going to vote meatloaf for one of two reasons. One, because that's what they wanted. Or two, because there weren't enough people that wanted what they actually wanted (see: first night) and meatloaf was better than liver and onions. The same was true for the liver and onions group.\n\nMy kids began to organize their efforts. They realized that every night there were only a few children voting differently from the night before, and that those few kids were the ones whose votes actually tipped the scale. Meatloaf realized that they could win more meatloaf dinners if they started actively trying to persuade these few kids. Liver and onion realized the same.\n\nEach night, both groups strategized the best way to convert the few that swayed the vote. They quickly realized that the best strategies required organizational effort on a large scale, and so formed formal parties: the Meatloafs (M) and the Liver and Onions (L). As time moved on, the Meats and the Livies got better and better at it, as you would expect of any group or individual that repeats the same task over and over again specifically with the goal of improving.\n\nOne of the strategies both groups employed was recipe selection. Not all meatloafs are the same, nor or all batches of liver and onions. Nor is one particular meatloaf or liver and onion the best version for all situations. For instance, the Meats found out that a spicier meatloaf did a better job of bringing out the un-preferenced, but it alienated a lot of core Meatloaf supporters, who had milder tastes. On nights when polls showed that the Meatloaf base really, *really* didn't want liver and onions, the Meats were safe in putting up a spicy recipe. Even though it alienated a few core supporters, those supporters really didn't want liver and onions, and so voted meatloaf like they normally do.\n\nOccasionally, a few kids from one of the major parties would decide that the system was broken because it only ever produced meatloaf or liver and onions. They would look around and assume that the two groups pushing meatloaf or liver and onions were the problem, particularly because the Meats and Livies would so vigorously stomp out any third party that threatened their winning. \n\n---\n\nOne night, five members of the meatloaf party decided that they were going to break rank and vote grilled cheese. They did so: \n\nFive voted for grilled cheese.  \nNine voted for meatloaf.  \nEleven voted for liver and onions.  \nTwenty-one abstained.  \n\n\n\nOn that night we ate liver and onions.\n\n---\n\nLearning from the previous night's failures, the Meatloaf party sat down with the Grilled Cheese party to talk. All but one agreed on a new recipe for meatloaf that was a little bit more like a grilled cheese but without being so unlike meatloaf, fried chicken and mashed potatoes, or lasagna that it would alienate other members of the party. The one that didn't agree said that Meatloaf would never compromise and that the only reason the Meatloaf party existed was because of kickbacks from the meatloaf industry. The remaining members told their brother to quit being so obnoxious, while the oldest quietly hid her wallet.\n\nAnd that's how it went for years. The core members of each party that cared the most would spend every moment between nightly elections working on winning the next election. Occasionally, some of the less concerned fringe members would vamp up as though this were their first mealection, demanding their demands be met. If they were able to temper their zeal, their party would slowly address their concerns--making sure not to fuck anything up in the process. If they could not, that party would lose (see: Night of the Grilled Cheese Insurrection).\n\nSome of those fringe members would stay active in shaping recipes after their enthusiasm waned, showing a real commitment and concern that lasted for more than just the election hours, while most would return to not paying attention. Once, my 27th child spearheaded the movement to add corn to the meatloaf recipe--a full two cups! She ended up getting a tbsp of cornmeal added *and* half a cup of corn. She stayed active in the party for years until the next wave of selectively-concerned children accused of her of being a party shill.\n\nOne night, my brother Bernard and our super-racist grandfather, Donnie, came over for dinner. Bernard asked my kids why they only ever ate meatloaf or liver and onions. About ten of my kids looked at me as though it were my fault, but the rest said that that's all we have because of the corrupt Meatloaf and Liver and Onion parties. I winked knowingly at my brother while he rolled his eyes as shouts of how bad our neighbor's kids--and some of mine!--are, echoed in from the living room where my grandfather was talking.\n\n**TL:DR Family meals really falls apart as a metaphor for describing the US election and voting system.**", "id": "d65t1uc"}, {"comment": "This is way better than OP's version.", "id": "d6587ui"}, {"comment": "I will do anything...", "id": "d659rl4"}, {"comment": "The day that yyour kids learn about 3rd party write ins is coming.", "id": "d65f1j7"}], [{"comment": "Can I have a thin and crispy Hawaiian please mom?\n\nNo. You've had that twice in a row.

", "id": "d7z5nex"}, {"comment": "(I'm going to go on a tangentially related rant)        \n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is that the people today consider themselves to the educated, modern people; baptized by reason. We often study other cultures or generations with the kind of mindset like \"Oh no, we can't be barbaric or stupid like that\" yet we are.        \nIn the Red Scare (1947-57, USA) communists became a sort of boogeyman to fear - every man was on guard from being influenced by communists, where in reality, the actual fear of communism was significantly overblown. Naturally, we are the educated people, so this can't happen to us. We do our due dilligence and can't be brainwashed like that right?  \n\nNo, we can be. We already are, as a society.   \n\nToday, the two overblown boogeymen of society are terrorists and pedophiles. Being killed by a terrorist in the west is so statistically unlikely, that is can be approximated to zero. But yet here we are with our security theaters of the TSA, the Patriot act, the NSA's snooping, and more. All in the name of protection from imagined threats. God help you if you try to suggest that we don't need as much \"protection\" as we get from these terrorists. You will not be well received by the majority.            \n\nPedophiles too, are another boogeyman that we must address. One by one, we as a society addressed everything related to sexuality in the past couple dozen years. Not too long ago, we considered the gay community to be mentally ill, and that they deserved the worst. But we are now a better society, and no longer think that. Then we thought transgender people were strange and weird, like the people who came before us thought about the gays. (we sorta still do tbh), but we've largely gotten past that, and trans folk are not persecuted to the extent of my knowledge.    \nThen we have those with the eccentric fetishes. Scat, necrophilia, zoophilia, pedophilia, you get the idea.              \nThese are all things that naturally occur in people. No man decides to be attracted to scat. No man decides to be attracted to corpses. Also, no man decides to be attracted to children.    \nFor the other groups of fetishists, they are not persecuted as monsters when (if) they reveal their fetish. They are labelled as weird, or just eccentrics, but certainly not monsters. What's more is that people can go to some sort of therapy for their fetish if they want to. Pedophiles can't because the therapist may report them. \nA man can born with the unfortunate attraction to children, but so long as he keeps his urges to himself, difficult as that may be, he should be free from harm and criticism.          \n\n**TLDR: We consider ourselves to be an enlightened people, but our treatment of the extreme fetishes and susceptibility to boogeyman suggests otherwise.**", "id": "d7z815k"}, {"comment": "People used to marry a lot younger back in the day and some cultures still do.

They haven't done anything all that wrong other wise. There was no inconsistencies in the characters. The couple legit look like a couple in the back of their yard over-admiring their lemon tree.

He fucking hates his life, his wife has become this obsessed housewife who has a ton of shit to bitch about despite not actually doing anything bothersome. Not to mention she is slowly letting herself go because in her book she has made out of her former slightly abusive small town life with her successful husband in a beautiful house with a nice lemon tree. He is not quite sure where he wants to go because it seems like he is spending more and more time at work busting his ass but his wife refuses to acknowledge him or his problems over her petty shit. \n\nNote his response to her wishing she was a lemon. If that isn't a man literally crying for his partner to care about him I don't know what is. But no she then moves on to lemon stealing whores. His response to this is probably the best part of this entire thing. You can almost see the exact moment he breaks. Look at his face before the cut to the lemon stealing whore and then after.

In the original joke at the top of this thread with the arms spinning, the guy thinks he has a plan. However, for this to be funny, you have to build up the plan. Over the course of the joke we come to expect a plan, then the hope is reversed and it is funny.  \n\nI think the joke is also funny if the audience expects something went terribly wrong, but the wisher just wanted the weird thing. This is very absurdist humor, and not everyone likes it. That is the orange for a head joke, where the wisher does not address the orange until the very end, and the result is absurd.  \n\nIf you do the orange for a head joke and say \"I fucked up\", there is not enough time between the plan being revealed and the plan going awry. You either need people to become attached to the plan (I want one arm to spin, I want another to spin, etc) and then expose it as foolish, OR you need people to expect a clever plan and turns out it was just what the wisher wanted.  \n\nBy only address the plan at the end and immediately recognizing it as bad, the joke is shortened from this long story to just a sentence.

This religious authority was basically part of a quisling government, supporting the Roman imperial occupation of Judea.\n\nChallenging this set of authorities was extremely dangerous and the Romans would have punished it severely - this is why Jesus is often observed being very careful about not saying seditious things (as when he is asked whether people should pay taxes, and he says \"render unto Caesar\", that they *should*, because to say otherwise would be seditious).\n\nEven when confronted with the charge of sedition, and accused of wanting to be \"King of the Jews\", Jesus proclaims his innocence.

Hence you have 93/95 in Boston. \n\nNow three digit interstates are usually circle roads, and the first number signifies how close to the city they are. Therefore it usually starts with 194, 295 and so on. Boston has 495, why it doesn't have the other tree is beyond me. Maybe it's because 95 already goes around the city.

There was something else to the numbers too, but I can't remember!\n\nWhat you're probably forgetting is the meaning of the evenness/oddness of the first digit. Only *even* numbers are ever beltways; they could also be either a bypass around a city or an... uh, anti-bypass through a city that splits and rejoins but doesn't really form a circle. (There might be an exception or two)\n\n*Odd* numbered first digits are spurs -- they only connect to the main interstate at one point.\n\nSo for example, if you're driving along on I-94 near Chicago and are passing through, you'll get to an I-94/294 split. You know from the number that you can take either path and get where you are going. You may not know which is better, but you know either will work. (In this case, I-294 is better, and I think in general the bypass is probably more likely to be better.)\n\nBut if you're coming in on I-55, you know you better not take I-355 because it won't rejoin under that route number.\n\nThat's why I-395 was skipped near Boston; there was no spur that needed that name, but there were two I-95 bypasses that needed numbers. [*Edit* per Curmudgy's comment, there's also an I-395 as well, from New London CT to Worcester MA, so it's there. But even if that number weren't taken, it'd have been skipped if there wasn't an I-95 spur needing a name. :-)]", "id": "d9hb2o3"}, {"comment": "Sadly, not necessarily.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_225\n\nEven number, Spur route.", "id": "d9hehuu"}, {"comment": "Not *necessarily*, but I did say there might be an exception or two. :-)\n\nAnd really, it's not an exception in being an exception. For example, Interstate 99 is a new route, and exists entirely between I-79 and I-81 instead of being at the extreme east. Or even-numbered interstates will run north/south for non-trivial distances, or vice versa. (For example, I-94 runs primarily north/south for more than 100 miles between south of Chicago and Milwaukee.) And there are places where a leading-even three digit interstate is a bypass in *one* direction but a spur in the other direction. (For example, I-376 runs from a I-76 junction east of Pittsburgh to *and past* an I-76 junction west of Pittsburgh, then as a spur up to I-80.)

I hope I can explain it from a grave diggers POV.\n\nThe **TLDR** answer to this is that you don't want to stick an excavator bucket through a corpse, to put it bluntly.\n\nThere is a standard depth between the bottom of one coffin and the lid of the one below, which should be measured and recorded to help anyone opening the grave for another interment. The place I worked allowed 3 coffins in a grave, with 6\" undisturbed soil between each coffin, and 2-3' between the lid of the top coffin and ground level.\n\nNow, imagine somebody hasn't recorded the depth of the last one, or the record has been lost. What we would do is stick a probe in to hit the lid and it'd give us an idea how far we've got until we hit the box. Of course, it could be the case that the lid has caved and you hit the bottom of the box with the probe (I'd be shocked if that had rotted away completely), in which case you would allow for an extra 21 inches (the depth of the box at 15\"+6\" soil).\n\nIn the absence of any sort of solid surface or record to guide you, grave digging would be very laborious and we'd probably be back to hand digging and using our nose for guidance!\n\nI appreciate this isn't the intended purpose of a coffin, but it's certainly a helpful coincidence.\n", "id": "cz0asax"}, {"comment": "I think it'd be more respectful of the dead if the coffin didn't collapse on their corpse and let the dirt flood in.

[Town Centre](https://www.google.ie/maps/@51.4060249,30.0577354,3a,75y,7.52h,88.93t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-pyLYJ4XSuCs%2FV4qAsP-glHI%2FAAAAAAABYyA%2FIAWoD5y0DSUP_4Jd1NViAFbHX5u30u1mACLIB!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh6.googleusercontent.com%2F-pyLYJ4XSuCs%2FV4qAsP-glHI%2FAAAAAAABYyA%2FIAWoD5y0DSUP_4Jd1NViAFbHX5u30u1mACLIB%2Fw203-h101-n-k-no%2F!7i8192!8i4096)\n\n[This is the touristy side of the power plant](https://www.google.ie/maps/@51.3919497,30.0952005,3a,58.5y,162.54h,92.53t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sm-gFpYFHHFPX4cBOu2JhjQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) because it's the only place you are allowed to take pictures of the plant, you can see a kind of mural thing in the distance and the picture of the plant has to have that in the shot. It's kind of a propaganda shot. In the street view position they seem to be building a massive shed of some kind, they were talking about that they could possibly be building this massive indoor weather controlled facility or something, basically they could make it rain indoors or something, maybe that's what they are building in the shot. That wasn't there when I was there O_O 10 years ago...\n\n[At the opposite side](https://www.google.ie/maps/@51.3876421,30.112372,3a,48.7y,312.39h,93.09t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sUuIcMShVGiVfMFMbivZQ8Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) is the entrance to the cafeteria I went in and ate a three course meal at the Chernobyl power plant. I'm not sure but I'm almost sure that's the location, it looks a bit different. If you look around the street view map you'll see a sign for a train. Yes the train to Kiev comes from west Ukraine, through Chernobyl and straight to Kiev. Now it might not use that track exactly but I saw the train travelling in the exclusion zone, they don't seem too worried about radiation or anything. Also when we were driving back to Kiev the people were swimming in the river north of the city, as if it was the beach, because they are so far from the coast, the river they are swimming in comes straight through Chernobyl. They obviously aren't worried about radiation. I presume there are some kind of filter with a damn further up stream but knowing governments, there probably isn't.\n\nI have our own pictures but I'm too lazy to find them and we took really shit pictures and I knew I should have been the picture guy but one thing I realized about taking pictures is that you focus on taking pictures and you might as well not be there so I didn't do much at all, there is probably 10 or 12 pictures in total. If your looking through the camera all the time you can't take it because your time is split between camera and being there and you are neither here nor there.\n\nBecause pripyat is so close to the belarusian border, people sneaked in over the years and have stripped the copper out of the place and anything of value. So you could have copper from pripyat in your computer or iphone right now. We went into the school, we went into one of the apartment buildings and went all the way to the roof, there was newspapers still sitting there from the day of the incident, there were dolls on the ground, a piano, the wallpaper hanging off. Apparently outlaws can hide there sometimes so at least that can fulfill you gaming fantasies.\n\nI saw a big mother fucking cat fish in the canal by the reactor, only recently I saw a documentary series called \"River Monsters\" and the guy in that tries to catch a Massive cat fish in the canal beside the power plant, so I can confirm there are massive fucking cat fish in the canal. I also didn't know for sure if it was a cat fish at the time, it had whiskers and the documentary confirmed what I had seen that day. I also didn't know how big they were suppose to be but apparently there are mutant size cat fish in the canal beside the power plant.", "id": "d7iukl9"}, {"comment": "I, too, would like to absorb what went on there", "id": "d7iknuv"}], [{"comment": "I just knew it was gonna be a mutated hand joke the moment I read the title.", "id": "d7ifo91"}], [{"comment": "I know someone lived about 100 km away from chernobyl, had to evacuate toa towneven further away,  she and her daughter have thyroid problems now.", "id": "d7igslv"}], [{"comment": "Ah, an old classic slav joke ", "id": "d7i7phf"}], [{"comment": "puts new meaning in \"I'm all thumbs\"", "id": "d7i7quq"}], [{"comment": "I think you meant, you can count the number of times your mother has been to Chernobyl on one hand.

Sure, could have sued for something or other to get that money back, but she was done trying to deal with the travelling and since then the word \"lawyers\" left a bad taste in her mouth, and I'm sure she could have handled it differently.\n\nOpposite example: my dad was \"leasing\" a mechanic shop (verbal contract). He fell behind on rent and stopped paying, the owner took him to court. My dad had a friend/client (fixed his car at some point) lawyer that reviewed the case, told my dad what to do. Court day came up, turns out that because my dad was an unlicensed mechanic, the owner was at fault for \"leaving his shop in the care of someone not qualified to run it\", and let my dad off the hook for the owed amount. By all accounts my dad was in the wrong, but a technicality ripped off another person of a previous agreement.", "id": "d0zposl"}, {"comment": "i actually do have a problem with lawyers on a personal level.   i never understood the hate that i saw lawyers getting on tv.  that was until started doing IT work for a few law firms, then I started to understand.  then I eventually had to hire a lawyer for personal reasons which developed a very real hate for the profession. \n \nso yea, you can hold the sarcasm, i have dealt with my share of lawyers, and 90% of the fucking sucked, so I have life experience to fuel my hatred, thanks.

But it probably doesn't help that there are *some* lawyers out there who try to get every goddamn penny they can out of their clients. Like when my grandfather died, at some point in the process the estate lawyer my mom hired sent her a document his office had prepared that had a typo in a street name. She called in and talked to a receptionist/assistant to inform them of the typo, and the lawyer ended up adding the time for that call and fixing the typo to the bill.\n\nWhy the fuck is this dude charging to fix a mistake he made?! I tutor online sometimes and I get paid by the minute. If I screw up an explanation or make a mistake, I'm going to pause the lesson clock because I don't want to charge them anything for me to correct something *that was entirely my fault.*\n\nBut of course, not all lawyers are like that, so it's an unfair stereotype.", "id": "d0ztat7"}, {"comment": "You know what's the problem with lawyer jokes?
