These people have had their emotions disabled due to trama. Beyond just being paralyzingly indecisive, they also show troubles maintaining social relationships, including holding a job. It seems emotions are needed to make complex relationships work.\n\nInterestingly economists, behavioral geneticists, and paleontologists had been working on this problem but from a different perspective. They were trying to resolve why people tended to play [the Prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) differently from what a rational look suggests. They made computer programs to play the game, and modified the game to make it more lifelike. I'll leave the long version for the book, but the rationalist tends to be too short sighted and also undervalues the importance of social reputation. The insights gleamed from programs were used to make modifications to the experiment to test the insights against people. For example is you can predict changes to the game that will change how people play it.\n\nThis lead to a bunch of theories on why we have seemingly irrational emotions. The simplified version is they are not irrational when you look at the big picture. They override your rational analysis when your rational analysis is likely to be wrong. They allow people to get more value out of social relationships and allow people to construct more complex social relationships.\n\nThese complex social relationships are critical to our advanced technology so it seems quite unlikely we could have developed it without our emotions.", "id": "d5k1kvp"}, {"comment": "You're still feeding the wrong wolf.

I think this might be a bad way to approach life because if you view everything from a REALLY big viewpoint, nothing matters anyways and why not just kill yourself right now, considering how little an impact it has on anything?

For example, while violent crime (defined as murder, rape (revised definition), rape (legacy definition), robbery, and aggravated assault) did increase from 2014 to 2015 (1.7%) it was lower than 2011-2012 (1.9%). So if people feel that violent crime has gotten worse over the years, they'd still be incorrect as 1.9% > 1.7%. And the periods of violent crime between was -5.4% and -4.6%.\n\nThe rape statistic also takes more digging. If you were to take the legacy definition numbers and average the numbers from 2011-2015, it comes out to:\n\n(-1.4)+(-10.3)+(4.6)+(9.6) = 2.5\n2.5 / 4 = 0.625% average increase in rape crime\n\nIf you were to use the revised criteria (only available from 2013-2015) and do the same with it you get:\n\n(-1.4)+(-10.3)+(-10.1)+(1.1) = -20.7\n-20.7 / 4 = -(5.175%) average decrease in rape crime\n\nSo depending on which you understand to be more accurate, rape is either up 2.5% on average from 2011-2015 or down 5.175% during that same period. You could break this information down further if you wanted and find out what the percentage of rape cases were men vs women and compare that to the opinion polls on perception of change in violent crime regarding harm to self and family members. It'd be interesting to see how it lines up.\n\nRunning the numbers the same way for violent crime overall produces:\n\n((1.9)+(-5.4)+(-4.6)+(1.7)) / 4 = -(1.6%) decrease in violent crime overall. \n\nThe second link you posted shows the revised 2015 numbers. It's interesting to read the FBI report they linked to. It does indeed show the largest increase in violent crime big cities (defined as 250,000 to 499,999; not sure what it is for 500,000+). But what is interesting to me is that if you break it out into 4 regions of the US, crimes were down 3.2% in the Northeast but increased 5.6% in the West, followed by rises of 1.6% in the South and 1.4% in the Midwest.\n\nApparently the region that New York is in is seeing a decrease in violent crime along with Boston, Detroit, and Philadelphia. What caught my eye the most was the FBI's warning on ranking cities that have the most crime:\n\n>  Caution against ranking: When the FBI publishes crime data via its UCR Program, some entities use the information to compile rankings of cities and counties. Such rankings, however, do not provide insight into the numerous variables that shape crime in a given town, city, county, state, tribal area, or region. These rankings lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that can create misleading perceptions that adversely affect communities and their residents. Only through careful study and analyses into the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction can data users create valid assessments of crime. The data user is, therefore, cautioned against comparing statistical data of individual reporting units from cities, metropolitan areas, states, or colleges or universities solely on the basis of their population or student enrollment.\n\nAnd seeing as how the site \"ranked\" them, I'm not to sure they proved their point. Additionally, other variables might be at play here such as more people moving west (lower cost of living, young people wanting to get out of small towns, etc...). \n\nFinally, to say crime is increasing may be like saying we've had 30 degree weather for the last 5 days and 65 degree for the next two. Has the temperature increased? Yes, but that doesn't mean the temperature is increasing for that month. And given prior year trends, it could be a blip.

But that's for a charity organization, or things like still being able to make that trip they always wanted but could not afford. \n\nThe dynamic of warriors and fighters itself is still very much true and I am disgusted by it. The notion that you can fight cancer by being brave and strong enough, implies that you can lose to cancer by being too cowardous. People don't realize how insulting that is towards the people who don't make it. I know many good people who were not fortunate to tell their tale, and believe me their lack of emotional willpower was not the problem.\n\nI started writing some part about my own experience, but it turned out longer than I anticipated.  \n\n tl;dr: My mother 'beat' lung cancer in some extremely lucky circumstances, the notion that this has to do with fighting and being brave is insulting. It would imply that the other (more likely) scenario would mean she is not brave enough.\n\n----------------\nSmall background story. My mother was diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer almost three years ago.  Median survival time is about 8 months, five year survival rate near 5 percent. The treatment was successful, as in the results looked clean after treatment, but a year later it seemed to have returned. For the record, the survival rates after recurrent lung cancer are general bleak as well, not longer than that 8 months.  \nAs she was still healthy (as in physically strong) at that point, the doctor advised as to postpone chemo and return after six weeks to see how fast it progresses. This was against the advice of the other hospital, and against the advice of AvL where we got a second opinion *the* big specialist hospital in the Netherlands. As we share the same mindset as our doctor, quality of life is much more important than a few months of being miserable during chemo we agreed with him. We postponed further treatment.  \nSix weeks later, no growth to see at all. So we scheduled another scan six weeks later. Again, no growth the see, next scan in three months. Flash-forward to this summer ~16 months after the recurrence, there was still no growth at all. The doctor has been expressing doubts about the nature of the spot earlier, but now he straight up said that it's extremely unlikely we're looking at cancer here. The spot showing up at the CT scan is most likely left-over scar tissue or some cyst. The diagnose of recurrency has officially been overturned to NED (no evidence of disease) since initial treatment. Just to be clear, three independent hospitals looked at the results and all came to the same conclusions. The PET-scan lit up (in hindsight probably a reaction to the radiation treatment) on an old tumor-site, which could be found in the CT-scan as well. It all fitted perfectly with the typical result where the patient relapses in a year or so. This was not a human error, they read the results correctly. It's just that the machine results gave a false positive, indistinguishable from real cancer.    \nWould we have followed the advice of the other hospitals, we would have experienced an awful path of chemo's again without any results to show for it. Probably, if we would have done a scan afterwards it would show no change at all. Which could make us think that the chemo would halt the growth but not eradicate the cancer. Anyway, you may guess how insanely grateful we are for our doctor for going off-protocol here and postponing the chemo. It's a life-saver in every sense, and a decision that turned out to be absolute gold.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say with this story is that my mother has been insanely lucky. Not only has she 'beaten' the statistics at least twice, but the decision of the doctor to go off-protocol turned out absurdly good. Where these results not false-positives however, she would probably have been dead by now. Just the slight implication the actual scenario as it turned out (opposed to the likely scenario where she would have been dead) has anything at all to do with fighting and being brave instead of a stupid amount of luck, is simply insulting. There's hardly a choice at all with this bloody disease. I'd even wager that the ones that decide to opt-out of treatment (in terminal cases) instead of fighting a pointless battle are the brave ones. Especially giving the taboo on that stuff.\n\nThis turned out to be a huge wall of text, but it's an issue that's can get me pretty frustrated at times.", "id": "d96so0k"}, {"comment": "Thanks.

They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them. **But at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies.** The spells that preserved them intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by.\"\n\nOld Castro doesn't really seem to be mad, either. Most of the cultists that we hear from in Lovecraft's stories seem to be people that have rejected human society and morals because human society has rejected them. And so Old Castro tells us just what it'll be like for him when Cthulhu returns:\n\n>That cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy.

All feelings are valid (even the irrational, petty, immature emotions of hormone-engorged teenagers), and fiction can teach us how to cope with feelings in a way that is constructive and helpful. It can teach us to engage with and understand our emotions, and to talk about them in a way that is actually useful, instead of saying \"Your emotions are stupid and we aren't going to deal with you until your emotions are less dumb.\"", "id": "d6e7wj0"}, {"comment": "1.

Maturity is in part about learning from your own past faults, even if they're faults everyone has had, and progressing past them because you realize how and why they were wrong.\n3. Fiction *can* teach us to cope with feelings in a way that is constructive and helpful. Many great works of YA fiction do that. My actual point was that the particular stories lampooned in the comic do not do that, but instead reinforce the immature feelings teens already have. They do not guide the reader toward a more mature understanding of themselves and their world but possibly stymies their development by indulging their irrationality. Hyper emotional irrationality is natural for teenagers. It is an experience to self-examine and learn from, not reinforce.\n4. Ironically, \"you're stupid and we're not gonna deal with you until you're less dumb\" is the way these particular trite YA novels teach kids to see adults. The adults are always either evil, blind, or complacent, and the teens can't wait to get away from them. That's not a realistic depiction of adults or the proper way for a teen to learn to engage with authority figures.\n\nedit: At least offer a rebuttal if you're gonna downvote.", "id": "d6e8avb"}, {"comment": "I apologize for my misinterpretation of your post and I appreciate the clarification. I respectfully disagree. No feeling is inherently superior to another. How you choose to act on your feelings is a matter of maturity and experience, but irrational feelings are just as important as those with reasonable associations. An irrational emotion is usually a reaction to something disconnected with the situation in which it is felt. Jealousy is an indicator of insecurity, for instance. Irrational anger may be a reaction to feeling threatened or frustrated. Learning to navigate our reactions to these feelings is important, but the feelings themselves don't come with values attached to them. \n\nFiction doesn't need to guide to teach us. Often, fiction serves as a catalyst for reflection and thought. As much as we agree with and cheer for our protagonists, we question their motives and consider how we might choose better than they have, and how things might be different were we put in the character's place. Horror movies are a classic example - how many times have you thrown popcorn at the screen while yelling obscenities about how dumb the characters in the movie are acting? How many rom-com problems could be solved with simple, honest communication and a dash of self-control? \n\nThe stupid-dumb adults in YA fiction are an externalization of frustration felt by real teens. Adults are the only authority young people know, and they often feel that those adults are completely blind to the intelligence and wisdom of teenagers. Adults treat teens like they are children; teens believe that they are more like adults. This dynamic creates a lot of frustration and conflict, and conflict is where drama happens. Ramp it up a bit, and you suddenly have every YA novel mom and dad. \n\nAnd let's be clear - many adults are evil, blind and complacent. Adults are a pretty mixed bag, and teenagers are at a stage of development that understands that. They are learning to see the world as adults see it. And the world is full of wonderful, brave, strong people - but it's also full of evil, misguided, terrible people, and teens need to learn to deal with that reality before they're sent off into the world without training wheels. \n\nEdit: I didn't downvote you.

There's an entire theory in psychology that posits that our basic emotions are adaptive but also have the potential to be maladaptive when they prevent us from dealing with the underlying feelings. According to this theoretical orientation, depression can, indeed, be attributed to not processing these underlying emotions in a healthy way. Different emotions can \"mask\" the underlying ones, though, it's not always anger. It could be shame, sadness, disgust, etc. \n\nGranted, that's just one approach and not all psychologists conceptualize depression this way, but it's a theory that fits for me when I work with clients.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "da3owmv"}, {"comment": "\"Also, I'm completely straight and my closest friends are all white.\"", "id": "da3n1w3"}, {"comment": "That's... extremely accurate actually.", "id": "da3ypdk"}, {"comment": "There's a line I can't cross.

The left hemisphere specializes in precision, in the syntax of language, its neurons have smaller receptive fields that help you hone in on the best words and the most likely interpretation of those words. The right hemisphere specializes in diffuse thought, the overall understanding of the meaning of a sentence, its neurons have larger receptive fields that help you consider less likely outcomes. Both hemispheres work in concert in your thoughts and speech.\n\nThe strongest evidence in favor of hemispheric difference is this: in \"eureka\" moments of insight problem solving, brain activity shows a tide of alpha waves in the visual cortex followed by a crashing tsunami in the RIGHT insular cortex.

Fighting off those feelings, and having them both work in conjunction is probably why people who are into pain can get a bit extreme.

(Or decades actually, the bottom 40% hasn't seen a wage increase since 1979, really that's true).\n\nThere's a good reason why the Democrats lost this one. Which is for a big part the same reasons people like Jeb Bush lost so bad. I'm pretty interested how Sanders, another anti-establishment candidate appealing to the middle class would have done. And, yes a big part of the DNC does lack every hint of self-reflection and try to blame it on external reasons. (Like James Comey). Yes, they're blind and I am afraid whether they actually learned from 2016. But I'm not buying the 'insulting' thing at all.\n\nAlso given the fact that the other side is just as bad in this regard. Everyone who does not agree with the Trump supporters online is a libtard communist cuck SJW who feels entitled to free shit. I agree that insulting and ridiculing won't convince anyone, but don't pretend like the right are special snowflakes that are not just as guilty.

This has a big lasting effect as we see it extended into a multitude of areas including courts, preconceived notions and judgments of strangers, etc... it's pretty easily argued that looking at men as being naturally incapable of taking care of children is very dangerous because it can be a reason random fathers who are alone at jungle gyms/parks with their child(en) are accused of being pedophiles. You hear about it a lot where a dad is just there hanging out with his kid and some random woman comes up and tries to take his kid away from him because she automatically think's he's trying to sexually abuse them.\n\nThese little things which are taken so lightly normally in tv, movies, comic strips, etc... because they are funny have a psychological effect on people and pointing out the double standards/damage they are doing helps to prevent their damage from propagating any further.

He can't both be $1000 ahead and a week's vacation ahead at the same time.\n\nIf the vacation time is paid for (as is customary), then he's getting paid exactly the same as if he was at work.  In this scenario, paying $3000 instead of $3500 is most definitely a cost savings at the end of the week.\n\nIf the vacation time is unpaid, then it's not really vacation time.  In this scenario, he's given up $1500 in wages in order to save $500, which does put him behind by $1000.  But he's only behind by $1000 relative to where he would be if he takes no vacation time at all.  Taking the vacation time at some other point in the year still costs him $1500 in wages regardless, and if he pays $3500 instead of $3000 because of this, then his vacation time may be better spent, but he's still overpaying by $500.\n\nSo the only valid part of the argument is that he could have used the vacation time on something better than camping outside Best Buy in the freezing cold.  But if we accept that as a given, then he's still $500 poorer for it.  If he simply wanted time away from work and preferred having more money in the bank than having a nice vacation, then he made the right decision all along.\n\nFurthermore, he may not have actually taken an entire week's worth of vacation, because most employers consider Thanksgiving a holiday, and a percentage of those also consider the day after Thanksgiving a holiday.  And since our subject is pulling down $1500 a week, that makes him far more likely than not to be working a job where he gets real holiday time.

Basically that there are no \"rules\" to making art because there are no \"rules\" on how to feel about art. While from a universal perspective this is ultimately true, unfortunately those who tend to support this view are often simply uneducated about art and art-making. The best argument I've seen against this thinking is from the Introduction chapter of Story by Robert McKee:\n\n\"*Story is about principles, not rules. A rule says, \"You must do it this way.\" A principle says, \"This works... and has through all remembered time.\" The difference is crucial. Your work needn't be modeled after the \"well-made\" play; rather, it must be well made within the principles that shape our art. Anxious, inexperienced writers obey rules. Rebellious, unschooled writers break rules. Artists master the form.*\"\n\nUltimately art is all about communication, and communication requires a link between intent and understanding. Sure, everything is subjective, but inherently artistic intent limits the scope of that subjectivity. There are correct interpretations, and incorrect interpretations, with the exception of if the intent itself is to have the work open to interpretation. This work however, does not fall into that camp.\n\nIn the chapter he goes on to expand on the issue, each section headlined with the following:\n\n*-Story is about eternal, universal forms, not formulas.*\n\n-*Story is about archetypes, not stereotypes.*\n\n-*Story is about thoroughness, not shortcuts.*\n\n-*Story is about the realities, not the mysteries of writing.*\n\n-*Story is about mastering the art, not second-guessing the marketplace.*\n\n-*Story is about respect, not disdain, for the audience.*\n\n-*Story is about originality, not duplication.*\n\nWhile this book is a staple of education in screenwriting, these principles truly speak to art-making in general, and their understanding should be better disseminated among the general audience at large.\n\nFind the rest of the chapter [here](http://www.slideshare.net/Recursosparaquadrinistas/robert-mc-keestory)", "id": "damabtr"}, {"comment": "I, and obviously many other, understood the message of the comic perfectly.

As of 1944 there is no conceivable strategy that would flip the war for the Germans.\n\n>The Nazis also invented very powerful nerve gasses but Hitler refused to use it because he considered it too evil and didn't want the Allies to use chemical weapons against Germany,\n\nBoth sides had potent chemical weapons that weren't used, and had since WWI. No new news here.\n\n> they also invented the first fighter jets but also declined to use them\n\nWat.\n\nThe Me 262 and Ar 234 reached full operational status as soon as they were possibly able, perhaps if mechanical failure rates are telling they were used even before they were ready. Not only that but British and American jet fighters had both entered production before the war was over, with Britain even beating Germany by having full squadrons equipped before them.", "id": "d98slls"}, {"comment": "OK. History time.\n\nThe Me 262 wasn't operational until 1944, by then the Nazi warmachine was coming apart and they didn't have the resources to make an effective number of jets. Let alone have pilots to fly them. They fielded as many as they could, and developed other jet planes. The Luftwaft was already on the decline by 1944 and lost air superiority...\n\nedit to add:\n\nThe Me 262 was flown in 1942 in tests, but the plane was found wanting, and required several engine redesigns before it was considered acceptable. Serial production didn't begin until 1944 because they didn't have the materials to make the engine. The first training squadron for the Me 262 didn't start until April 1944, around the same time the Allies were using P51 Mustangs to do fighter-sweeps ahead of day-light bombing raids which marks the beginning of the Allies' Air Superiority over Europe. The idea that Hitler didn't want jets because the Luftwaft didn't need them doesn't make sense considering it was approved for production *before* the Axis lost air superiority. If they didn't need it, why were they making them. Especially considering how expensive they were resource-wise to both build and maintain. An Me 262 engine was only good for maybe 20 hours of run-time, while comparable prop planes could run for over 120 hours.\n\nIt wasn't until March 1945 that the Germans could use the Me 262 in any kind of effective attack.\n\nedit: Re: Nerve Gas\n\nGermany produced Tabun, a deadly nerve agent, with the intent to use it in shells and bombs (and they did make these munitions, it wasn't a hypothetical). Nazi Germany produced upwards of 30,000 tons of different chemical weapons. These nerve agents were supposed to be a secret. However in a meeting with Otto Ambros, a lead developer of chemical weapons at IG Farben, Hitler was informed that:\n\n1. Tabun was not a secret weapon. It was a known agent since at least the early 1900s and IG itself had patented the two in the late 30s. So the likelihood is that the Allies knew about them.\n\n2. If Germany used Tabun gas, they had to be prepared to accept the possibility that the Allies had the capacity to produce many times more gas than the Germans.\n\nThe meeting ended early when Hitler stormed out of the room. Chemical weapons were never used, but the production continued regardless. Hitler was not prepared to face the possibility that the Allies had the same weapon as him, and in greater quantities. During that meeting Hitler asked Ambros about Allied chemical weapon production, and dismissed Ambros' comments re: the production capability of vast amounts of mustard gas because Hitler thought his tabun gas *the shits*. To me that does not sound like someone who thought chemical weapons were evil. Nevermind the fact that he *used them on human beings*.", "id": "d98qvnr"}, {"comment": "Even if Operation Overlord were a complete loss, it simply would have delayed the war.

However, in DADA and surrealism, in addition to employing irony, images or phrases are juxtaposed irrationally, non-sequitur, and absurdist, *strongly enough to be distinctly surreal*, and in plain old irony, well, things are merely *surprising based upon their expected outcome.*\n\nTL;DR: Though I can see why you've made the word choice you've made, there's no need to further branch this writing as surreal, or surrealist, when it shows no further characteristics of surrealism other than being merely ironic.", "id": "d7a3d09"}, {"comment": "Nah it's surrealism.", "id": "d7a59mz"}, {"comment": "No, this thread is surrealism, because you're all flipping coocoobananacoasters.

Imagine it this way:\n\nYou wake up one morning not feeling particularly tired or under-the-weather, so you skip your morning cup of coffee. You don't necessarily like the taste, and your schedule isn't too busy, so why not just save the coffee for times when you *are* busy, right? So you eat your breakfast and it's off to work.\n\nYou get to work wondering why you ever even needed caffeine in the first place. You're not sweating, you're not anxious or jittery, you feel well rested, but you have just the slightest headache. Forget about it and go on with your day, it's nothing. \n\nOnce lunchtime rolls around you're getting a bit tired and the dull headache is still there. Still beats addiction, you tell yourself. Mark walks by, cup of coffee in hand, and reminds you about the project that's due, so you thank him and go on your way. You know about the project, and you know about the due date. You've been working on it for a month now, of course you haven't forgotten about it. But for some reason Mark always feels the need to fuckin' micro-manage everyone in the building. Meanwhile he's dicking around on his computer not getting shit done. You try to ignore the constant, incessant clicking of his keyboard while you do your job. \n\nCathy drops by and asks how you're doing. \"Great! Just doing some last minute touch-ups. Yourself?\" You're not doing great, Mark is over there typing up the Tale of Two Cities on a 1920's mechanical keyboard. It aggravates you that you had to lie and say you're doing great. Meanwhile Cathy is talking about her children like she *always fucking does*. A simple \"I'm good\" would have sufficed, yet for some reason she feels like giving you her goddamn life story while you're busy getting shit done. The coffee machine in the breakroom is brewing, but you're better than that. \n\nFinally it's time to go home, and all you can think about is changing into comfortable clothes, putting on some slippers, and watching some TV on the couch. Traffic. Everyone and their grandma has decided to take the same exact route that you're taking, and what should be a 10 minute drive turns into purgatory. Your headache is throbbing. You can *still* hear the never-ending clicks of Mark's keyboard. Fuckin' Mark. You want to punch the steering wheel or honk your horn or cut through the median or *something*, but you bottle it up and let it brew inside you. \n\nYou pass by the second Starbucks on your way home from work. The next morning you wake up, get the coffee brewing, and head to work. \n\nAddiction is not something to be taken lightly.

My grandmother said \"sheep husbandry\" was a common practice in Wales not so long ago (she was with the Red Cross and stationed in Cardiff during World War II). Said there must have been some sort of underground geneticist community there because many of the Welshman she encountered were quite enthusiastic about mixing their DNA with that of sheep. So much so, they rarely had any to spare for the local women. \n\nThe only time my grandmother had any luck in procuring a load was when she wore her wool gingham dress (the one that showed off her aries tramp stamp) and rubbed mutton beneath her armpits before heading to the pub. Unfortunately, that wasn't always enough. \n\nIn such instances, she found that engaging the men in sheep talk helped get the juices flowing. Specifically, she asked them how many sheep they owned. Why did this work? Well, in most parts of the world, counting sheep makes one drowsy. For Welshman, however, the effect is quite the opposite. According to my Nana, rather than drowsiness, they instead experience an \"awakening\" in their trousers that is most likely Pavlovian in nature (right down to the drooling). \n\nFrom there, it was mostly smooth sailing, although many of the men she went home with requested she make soft, bleating sounds while they flocked. It was so they could maintain turgidity. Using lamb skin condoms also helped, both in maintaining inflacitude as well as for providing a more efficient collection method. \n\nOn a side note, Nana says the local women never talked about this phenomenon, in public or in private, lest they be branded a black sheep.

Some arthropods even have three pairs of legs (known as non-insect hexapods, these include diplurans, proturans, and collembolans). They also have similar body plans and antennae. But insects only have muscles in the first two segments of their antennae. Their mouthparts are unique as well: they are protracted to the outside of the head and the mandibles each have two pivot points where they attach to the head, which make them very secure (they call these *dicondylic* mandibles). Their eggs develop into embryos differently, too: they go through what is known as superficial meroblastic cleavage, where the egg divides at the surface and the yolk remains inside. Insects are also the only group of arthropods with ability to fly (with the exception of some primitive insects and secondarily wingless insects) and bear pairs of wings on their second and/or third thoracic segments.\n\nWithout all these features, even with six legs, an insect it cannot be.", "id": "d9jdqgh"}, {"comment": "You forgot wings. \n\nSo a winged centaur wearing plate armor might qualify.

It was really interesting to hear Steve Novella (doctor and president of the New England skeptical society who runs the podcast *Skeptics Guide to the Universe*) talk about how there are a lot of actual oversimplifications about there being *no* differences between races, but much less than people who think there are might think, because just because we're able to phenotypically classify people with such ease like how forensic investigators may literally call a skull reliably \"caucazoid, negroid, or mongoloid\" as awkward as those phrases about these phenotype expressions are (phenotypes being the physically-viewable expressions of genetics), the overall genetic makeup of peoples of different races is so much less significant than we commonly think.  \n\nThis is because at one point the human race faced a bottleneck and was down to literally just a few thousand humans, which is hard to take into common sense consideration of genetics, and because we don't really understand how easily genetics are spread through migration even when it doesn't affect phenotype genetic expressions.  \n\nSo even though you may assume two groups of Europeans are more closely related than a group of Sub-Saharan black-skinned Africans, you're not necessarily right.   \n\n[Here's an NIH study that explains the science way better than my layman butchering has done.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/)  \n\nBut the better takeaway isn't how some groups are more closely related than similarly \"racial\" groups because of genetics, but that we all share way, way, way, way more genetics than is commonly understood because *so* recently in our evolution we hit a bottleneck of just a few thousand humans. So while phenotypes can vary greatly, our genetics vary MUCH less than many other species.

It actually worked really well because you aren't fixating on stupid shit like skin pigment or gender or sexuality, etc.\n\nThis got replaced in the late 80s when social academics switched and told everyone that everyone needed to be multicultural and politically correct and focus on race as a way to end racism. The system we use nowadays is a scam because none of that bullshit was about ending racism, it was about exploiting race issues as a method to divide & conquer.\n\nColorblind theory is criticized nowadays by upper class academics who profit off race issues and they enforce idiotic terms like 'white privilege' which is just another way to divide the public and make people fight each other while rich people make money off this bullshit.\n\nI don't consider myself 'white'. I am white but it's not the thing that defines me. If you call me white, then you're ignoring who I am as a person and labeling me by my skin tone which is racist and I fucking hate racists.\n\nWe collectivize people because we're trained to do so and that's part of the systemic racist system that reinforces this race war bullshit because they don't want us to see each other as equal and get together so we can fix issues like economic inequality where rich people have all the money and poor people have none.\n\nIn a class system, being equal is good for poor people. It comes down to rights. You may have more money than me, but that doesn't mean you have more rights than me.

Prospector Pete over in the middle right seems to be putting his hand on his head in a gesture of worry/consternation, and the two guys in the background seem to be in the middle of a discussion about what it could be. There's an audience member in the far right panel with his hands on his head in a \"tearing my hair out\" kind of pose.\n\nThis combined with the way the hanging man is trying to steer them into the right answer (which would be pointless if he was being maliciously railroaded) makes me attribute it more to stupidity than malice--no one involved seems to bear the man any particular ill-will. The guy painting the letters seems bummed out. \n\nTwo characters that are inscrutable are the sheriff and the preacher(or is that a judge?). They are presumably running the show and presumably picked the word, which would make it a kangaroo court--but I don't think the audience members are being malicious here. Perhaps the message is that the populace is too stupid to have a real grasp of the judicial system that shuttles defendants through to their dooms? \n\nI'd be interested to hear your opinion on why you think the crowd is deliberately getting the letters wrong.\n\nEdit: I asked the guy on facebook, he replied:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qk0uwvX.png", "id": "d39i1fk"}, {"comment": "They dun want to see a hangin", "id": "d39k1j3"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d38w0yn"}, {"comment": "Even if he did see it, it's completely within the realm of possibility that he forgot.

They were identified with seven gods (Helios, Selene, Ares, Hermes, Zeus, Aphrodite, and Cronus), but the reason there's seven of them is because that's how many moving things there are in the night sky.  (The other three or four planets are invisible without a telescope.)\n\nThe Greeks also had a 7-day week - thanks to the Babylonians - and they were the ones who first associated each day with one of the planets.  (Originally, each *hour* of the day was associated with a different planet, in order of apparent orbital time around the Earth; if you do that and look at the name of the same hour on seven consecutive days, you get the modern order of weekdays.)\n\nWhen the Romans conquered the Greeks, they assumed the Greek gods were the same as theirs, just with different names. So they attempted a mapping, and came up with Sol, Luna, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. For the planets, those names stuck through into modern English.  But weekday names took a more roundabout path, probably because the Romans didn't adopt the 7-day week right away; they continued to use their 8-day market system.\n\nThanks to Christianity, the 7-day week eventually caught on across Europe, with one of two naming schemes: simple numbering (in the more religious countries, with \"Lord's Day\" and \"Sabbath\" in place of 1 and 7) or the local mapping of the old Greek god-names.  As English is a Germanic language, we inherited the Germanic version of the latter: Ares became Tiw (Norse Tyr), Hermes became Woden (Norse Odin), Zeus became Thor, and Aphrodite became Frige (Norse Frigg).

However, there are ways to ask these questions that won't upset me (or your local friendly bartender). For instance:\n\nIf you really want to piss me off, chuckle and say \"Oh anything that's good.\" That's a good way to get put at the bottom of my priority list. A) My version of \"good\" and yours might be completely different. B) I'm your bartender, not your babysitter. If you're here to get trashed, memorize a vodka. For example, Crown Russe. If you order a shot of Crown Russe and nothing else, I know you're either Russian or here to get fucked up. If you don't finish that sentence with \"Thanks, Comrade.\" I'll know that you're just here to get fucked up. \n\nOn the other hand, if you come to me and say \"Hey, I'm looking for something new that's sort of light that won't get me hammered. Any suggestions?\" I'd make you something with limoncello, fresh basil, and champagne. With delight. If you ask me for a specialty for dudes, I'd quickly assess your size and either make something that could kill a horse OR make you whatever I made last and could prepare quickly. \n\nAdditionally, you probably don't want to do any of this if the bar is packed. A lot of bartenders take pride in their craft and would be happy to chat in an empty or near empty bar, but if we're four people deep everywhere at the bar, you'll get varying (and mostly negative) results. \n\nTL;DR: Don't do it when we are busy, and when you do it, give us a direction to go in.

It makes so much more sense that the artist is commenting on these very real recent events. You don't have to support trump to see this.

But then, common sense would also tell me that that candidate would have to be joking when saying he would build a 50' wall across the entire Southern border of the US.

The mainstream media doesn't report on it, but the burden has been high on the countries dumb/politically correct enough to think you can simply merge refugees with western civilization. \n\nIf you watched his rallies and tried to see what his message was, you'd learn most of what you said is just not valid. \n\nWhat are you thoughts on the hillry crimes? She has a graveyard in her closet that spans 20+ years. Every thing liberal voters claim to be for, she is against, except of course when she goes up to speak.

The oh-so-tolerant Genghis also slaughtered 40 million people just because he wanted their stuff.\n\nAnd to reiterate, I'm not saying Trump is some Great Satan/Hitler clone.

It doesn't have anything to do with racism. Currently in Africa, blacks own other blacks as slaves. People do bad things, and it isn't always linked to race. \n\nThe minorities for Trump are not \"Mintorites\u00ae.\" Why would Trump support minorities joining [his clubs in the 90s](http://netrightdaily.com/2016/03/trump-insisted-on-including-jews-and-blacks-at-palm-beach-golf-course-in-1990s/)? Why would hillry instead be a part of a [white's only group](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/21/us/the-1992-campaign-democrats-clinton-says-golfing-at-all-white-club-was-mistake.html)? Just sit and watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxaKUo5naoY) and ask yourself if that is a man who is a racist. \n\n>When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families\n\nSo? How is this related to hate or racism? Terrorists threaten the western world and its foundation. I don't see a problem with this, as obama already blows up civilians to hit specific high priority targets. The US will never target civilians unless absolutely necessary. In trumps larger narrative, this is simply a part of \"America First.\"\n\n>Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\n\nSo? In context of the refugee crisis and spike in crime in Europe due to the Syria war and other terrorist groups, trump made it clear we would not participate. Again, how is this racist? An ideology is not a race. Also, in light of the current Europe crisis, current Muslims have no concern in the US. Laws protect religion anyway. This is an immigration issue, not a religion or race issue. \n\n>He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there's something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim, I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that\n\nOkay, slightly relevant. Trump doesn't have much of a filter. I don't see a comment like this as a deal breaker. He also called Rosie a fat loser or whatever else. I don't care if he had a dispute with a particular individual. It is a negative, but not a deal breaker and it isn't relevant to other issues. Not liking an individual woman doesnt equate to not liking woman, just like disliking a certain dog doesn't mean you hate all dogs... It is quite the leap to connect the two. \n\n>As for Hillary, I'm not a huge fan. I think some of the things she did may have been serious enough to warrant a trial, but no moreso than the previous administration\n\nHillry condoned Bill's acts against women. Hillry defended a child rapist and laughed about it. She takes money from corporations. She wants to export jobs. Just about every thing she says, you can find a video of her saying the opposite. She has stood against gays, and was for the Iraq war. She is a part of the Benghazi issue and kept emails on a private servers that hackers gained access too, a federal crime that warrants prison. If you don't like trump, you must think she is pure evil OR watch limited news. She has financial ties with CNN. That is why after the early debates, when 75% of online CNN voters says Bernie won the debate, they deleted the poll and posted an article about how Hillry won. She recently said she was going to put coal miners out of business and then days later, to a miners face, says she didn't mean it. \n\nIf you call yourself a liberal, Hillry is like Bush/Obama but many times worse. Even the people who work with her say she is horribly mean and looks down on everyone around her. \n\nThe only way Bernie is going to overcome the democratic party obstacles, is to win the voters by such a huge margin they can't deny it. he is already way ahead of her in recent events. People are seeing what is going on, even though the media feeds the opposite narrative on a daily basis. \n\nTrump would wipe the floor with Hillry in the general. Bernie, not so much. Bernie seems to have his heart in the right place, even if many disagree with his policies. \n\nWhen trump first joined the race, I scoffed. But, he wiped out the competition. Listen to a few rallies and you'll see why. It is all about America First. Americans see our country in a decline, so America #1 is a very strong message. \n\np.s. The media says trump is about hate, but his rallies are peaceful. The protesters outside his rallies though... not so much. In Arizona and CA there were people burning american flags, waving mexican flags, vandalizing property, smashing cop car windows, and assaulting/stealing from trump supporters. It was pretty chaotic, and hardly peaceful or accepting.

I'm well aware that Islam isn't a race; that doesn't mean that discrimination based on religion isn't discrimination, and it doesn't mean that Trump can't *also* be racist.\n\n\"Trump isn't a fascist, he just puts America first\"\n\nWhile I recognize that there are other elements to fascism, ultranationalism is definitely one of the biggest red-flags (which goes hand-in-hand with blaming a perceived decline in a country's wellbeing on a scapegoat minority group or sinister outsiders).\n\nAlso, I feel like it's not really relevant whether Donald Trump actually believes that the majority of illegal immigrants are murderers and rapists (in fact they commit crimes at a lower rate than white Americans) or whether he actually believed that there was doubt as to Obama's country of birth. The fact is, he's used those false, bigoted premises to drum up support. He promises to build the world's gaudiest piece of security theater for the stated purpose of protecting us from a threat that is...at *best*, exaggerated to the point of absurdity. So if he's not a bigot, he's just disingenuously capitalizing on the bigotry in others to grab power. \n\nAnd while we're on the subject of Trump supporters and bigotry...you keep pointing out that Trump rallies are peaceful. How is that relevant? Is the fact that Trump supporters surrounded by other Trump supporters at a Trump event don't randomly start fighting amongst themselves supposed to imply *anything* about them? Of course, if they had a good record of peacefully dealing with dissenters within their midst, that might be another story--but they don't. Not even close. I don't know what rallies you're watching, but I've seen two videos where nonviolent protestors were brutally attacked by Trump ralliers and several more where the violence was mutual, with neither party having a particularly viable claim to self-defense, as near as I could tell. Which isn't surprising, given that Trump told his protestors to \"knock the crap out of\" anyone who looked like they might throw fruit. That's not self-defense or security-mindedness. That's encouraging escalation of violence, which even if that's another example of his 'coarse humor' still says to his constituency that escalation of violence is something to laugh about.\n\nYou're right about the violence and destruction caused by anti-Trump activists being reprehensible and criminal, but it's disingenuous to pretend that Trump's own camp is above reproach in that regard.\n\nNow, I'm glad I had this conversation with you. I can't say you've made me less uneasy at the prospect of a Trump administration, but you've been courteous, and that's more than I can say for many people on either side.

From my definition it follows that humans are killing the Earth.\n\nNote the active form: there will likely never come a point when humans have killed the entire Earth, nor was this ever suggested. If anything, I suggested the opposite.

If all mammals, all reptiles, all fish died due to our actions but plant life lived on, you did not kill the earth from the perspective that killing all life is killing the earth.\n\nYou make the claim that animals dying out makes the Earth \"more dead\". There's no such thing as \"more dead\" either something is dead or it's alive. As long as there is the potential for life to grow and thrive and life exists on that planet, it is \"alive\" by your own definition. (again I don't consider the Earth to be alive)\n\nBy increasing the temp and killing off non-plants all you have done is shifted the climate in favor of plant life. The earth is fine, plant life is thriving. It's also likely that the bacteria that lives near geothermal vents are also just fine. And eventually after millions of years other forms of life like fish and other animals will evolve and come back once the planet swings back toward a favorable environment. And there's no reason to believe that plant life will be wiped out by global warming. Even if all land-based plant life dies due to the heat, it's arguable that the ocean will never get hot enough to kill off all of the algae and sea plants and these are the plants that do the overwhelming majority of CO2 to O2 conversion. As these plants thrive the greenhouse gases will be removed from the atmosphere and the planet will cool down again. Life will continue.\n\nSo you haven't killed the Earth.

I couldn't find any data or research on how much energy you'd need to do that, but keep in mind that the earth's core is an extremely dense and hot ball of molten iron approximately 3,500 kilometers in radius. Given that the most powerful nuclear weapon we have could only dig a hole 617 meters in radius in much less dense rock, I'll let you imagine how many you would need to make a dent in there.

The subtlety of doing those two things: 1) making those panels blue and 2) giving the squirrel the idiosyncratic speech of the woodcutter (\"and shit\") saves the impact for the punchline. A lesser artist would either make it too obvious that the earlier panels are fiction (so you work it out before the final panel) or not make it obvious enough (and so you have to read through the comic again to understand what was happening in the final panel).

My point wasn't about composition, it was just about the mechanics of fertilization. Fertilization is the easiest part of development, if there is sperm in contact with the egg fertilization is extremely likely to occur, and a failure of fertilization would be more likely to be caused by an acrosomal deficiency in the sperm (inability to digest the zona pelucida or inability to deliver DNA across the cell membrane). Once fertilization occurs the sperm is gone. As soon as the DNA from the sperm makes it to the germinal vesicle (nucleus of the egg) you have an embryo, but really it's best to consider it still an \"egg\" until it starts transcribing its own mRNAs. What I'm driving at is that this is the point where differences between eggs come into play is more often by far going to be after fertilization. Most failed pregnancies are due to failure of implantation, but other likely causes are polyspermy, non-disjunction, improper levels of maternal mRNA, ect. These are the kinds of things that can make one egg become a viable embryo while another dies, but the eggs aren't ever in direct competition for fertilization (only one egg is released at a time), so it's a matter of timing that decides which egg gets a chance at becoming an embryo.

I'm sorry you misunderstood, I didn't realize.\n\nThrough natural selection female pandas evolved so that they go through estrus once a year and are only receptive for only 2 - 3 days in their mating months time frame. So there is only 2 - 3 days out of 365 in a year that they can get pregnant. On top of that, panda's are solitary critters, so they live alone in *vast* territories (approximately 3km - 15km) in size. This means that males need to find receptive females in this small time frame, **and** she must successfully carry through with the pregnancy and support the cub so it lives on to reproduce itself. Furthermore, pandas aren't sexually mature until ~4 - 8 years old.\n\nAll these factors result in a low reproductive rate for the panda population which helps prevent overpopulation and the depletion of resources.

It fueled her, it consumed her very identity so much so that her entire sense of self-worth and being was now tied to her being ugly.\n\nShe started ugly acceptance campaigns claiming that women that were ugly like her are actually what is REALLY beautiful and what society considers to be beautiful is fake, unrealistic, disgusting. She created support groups and echo chambers where ugly ducklings would tell each other they were beautiful and society is wrong for not recognizing their beauty.\n\nDeep down though, the ugly duckling knew that she was lying to herself. She wasn't beautiful, and everything she has done to convince herself she doesn't care about society's standards of beauty just made her long to be truly beautiful even more.\n\nShe was empty inside, and self-righteous anger is the only way she knows to cope with that emptiness.
