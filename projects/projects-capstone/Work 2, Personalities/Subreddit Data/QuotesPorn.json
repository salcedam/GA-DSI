The reason why there are lots of guns around is because the Swiss military system demands its soldiers = Swiss males (we have a milita system) to have their service weapon at home.\n\nNow that being said, there's a few things to say about this, because most people get the wrong idea from this:\n\n* There are about 8,3 million people living in Switzerland, but only about ~140000 of those people belong to the military. If you add those in reserve, this number goes up to 180000 total. Which is far from \"basically everyone in Switzerland\".\n\n* Soldiers who get mustered out have the option to keep their guns. However, not a lot of people choose this option, as of the last count there are about 650000 (ex-)service guns in Swiss households. Which is STILL far from \"basically everyone in Switzerland\".\n\n* Also, if you want to keep your gun although you are no longer part of the military, you have to get a license for it.\n\n* Soldiers have to keep their guns at home, however, they are not allowed to take the ammunition for the guns with them. The system works like this: In case of war, the military would drop the ammo, so that soldiers can load their weapons and proceed to gather fully armed. So: Even though there's lot of guns in Swiss households, most of them can't be used because there's no bullets for them available.\n\n* Last but not least: While gun violence in Switzerland isn't high, it isn't all that low either, compared to similarly \"save\" countries. For example: The U.S., where the debate about firearm-related deaths is a never fading topic of debate, has about 10 firearm-related deaths per 100000 people (link [here](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states)). Switzerland, on the other hand, has about 3 firearm-related deaths per 100000 people (see [here](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/switzerland)). Now, while this number is obviously much lower than the number in the U.S, it's still pretty high compared to similar countries: For example, in the Netherlands there are only 0,58 firearm-related deaths per 100000 people ([link](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/netherlands)), in the UK it's only [0,23](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-kingdom), Australia is [0,93](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/australia), Romania (I'd argue not necessarily known as a very safe country when compared to Switzerland) is as low as [0,14](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/romania). And there are other examples like [South Korea](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/south-korea) or [Japan](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/japan) who are even lower. Now obviously, having a low number of firearm-related deaths per 100000 people doesn't mean there's no crime or violence, but still, Switzerland is not a \"shining\" example of a country loaded with guns, in fact, given the relatively small number of people who own guns (as I said before, about 650000 use the option to keep their service weapon), I'd say a number of more than 3 firearm-related deaths per 100000 is actually rather high.\n\nEdit: my numbers were slightly outdated, but only by very little. To better illustrate my last point, look at this graph: http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/194/rate_of_all_gun_deaths_per_100_000_people/10,91,152,170,178,192,125", "id": "d63tuc8"}, {"comment": "Sure we have a high \"firearm related death\" (which is a meaningless term to be honest and just used to spread fear and further anti-gun agendas) because of our high suicide rate committed with guns, which is still not even 20% of all suicides in Switzerland and since it's a cultural thing I don't see how it's relevant.\n\nOur gun homicide is only slightly higher than the UK and in many occasions it's even lower than most of Europe, since in 2014 we had only 7 gun homicides which gives us a rate of around 0.08 per 100k people.\n\nOur overall homicide is actually one of the lowest in the world at 0.49 per 100k people. In Europe only Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Andorra have lower homicide rates than us.\n\nSo yeah, my country is indeed very safe, safer than virtually all European countries with less guns and stricter gun laws.

Yes, it's a 100% deadly weapon, which makes them seem right. But often, the people who take a stance against guns (personally, I think \"taking a stance\" is the wrong way to approach things like this) look at all the death these 100% deadly weapons create, and how easy it is comparatively:\n\n- Person wants to commit suicide? Easier with a gun.\n- Person wants to kill their family? Easier with a gun.\n- Person wants to massacre a school? Easier with a gun.\n\nInterestingly, guns are also safer for the offending party to USE than most other options. Even if those options are everyday, not 100% deadly weapons (or not weapons at all):\n\n- Laptop battery? Low profile, but requires know-how and could cause injury to the offender when activated.\n- Pressure cooker? Conspicuous unless properly concealed. Difficult to control when it goes off and still be out of harm's way (or far enough away to not be a suspect).\n- Truck. Everyday transportation, but you have to get up close and personal, while having bodies fly past you, and possibly into your windshield/ face.\n\nIf you consider gambling / business, guns are a low risk, high reward item for the offending party. The business end of the weapon requires it to be pointed away from you for maximum efficiency, it's easily controlled, and often has the ability to find a target on its own accord. Not to mention that handguns especially are easily concealed and come in various sizes and caliber.\n\nIt can be difficult to try and suggest that an item that is 100% a lethal weapon isn't just designed for killing, despite it being really good at it, and that it can be used for defense as well.

It's very small percentage, and it is unethical to punish a majority because of a minority. \n\n\nIt's very easy to ask \"what changes if we just strip you of your weapons\" when you personally do not care about weapons and will be losing nothing. Just try to apply it to other arguments. Such as religious garments. The \"Ban the burqa\" slogan is something I see every now and then. And why not? What would really happen if we in western societies banned it? It wouldn't ruin their lives, it's not even really stated as a requirement in the Koran, so it is hardly a religious encroachment.

He fled to the family cottage, Windemere, on Michigan's Upper Penninsula. For months, he could not write at all. Then, at a crossroads in his young life, he began again. His sentences now were short and simple, the irony bitter and harsh, each word like his first steps without crutches or his cane.  \n> In \"Crossroads,\" there are two kinds of people, the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots.\" The difference has nothing to do with money, or success, or family. **The best people possess a feeling for beauty, the courage to take risks, the discipline to tell the truth, the capacity for sacrifice. Ironically, their virtues make them vulnerable; they are** [... page ends.]\n\nI tried to find a copy of \"Crossroads\" in order to prune the quote directly, its either a short story called \"Crossroads\" or a short anthology entitled \"*Crossroads \u2013 an Anthology*\" and both are said to have been published after he died in a book called *Ernest Hemingway: The Collected Stories*.

However, Project Gutenberg is listing [The Collected Stories](http://www.gutenberg.us/articles/ernest_hemingway:_the_collected_stories) as not having a story called 'Crossroads' in it, leading me to believe that the McDowell was either wrong or the story was pulled before publication for some reason.\n\nHowever, I cannot easily get my hands on a digital or physical copy of the Collected Works from Random House's 'Everyman Series' find a primary source for the damn quote anywhere.

So I'll save here what I can:\n\n> N EARLY MARCH, 19(28?), HEMINGWAY GOT SOME SHOCKING news. A letter from Agnes characteried their love as a \"boy and girl affair\" and announced her plans to marry an Italian duke. Hemingway was stunned and heartbroken. He fled to the family cottage, Windemere, on Michigan's Upper Penninsula. For months, he could not write at all. Then, at a crossroads in his young life, he began again. His sentences now were short and simple, the irony bitter and harsh, each word like his first steps without crutches or his cane.  \n> In \"Crossroads,\" there are two kinds of people, the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots.\" The difference has nothing to do with money, or success, or family. **The best people possess a feeling for beauty, the courage to take risks, the discipline to tell the truth, the capacity for sacrifice. Ironically, their virtues make them vulnerable; they are** [... page ends.]\n\nI tried to find a copy of \"Crossroads\" in order to prune the quote directly, its either a short story called \"Crossroads\" or a short anthology entitled \"*Crossroads \u2013 an Anthology*\" and both are said to have been published after he died in a book called *Ernest Hemingway: The Collected Stories*. The work is mentioned in an NYT article entitled \"[5 Unpublished Stories in Hemingway Book](https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/04/specials/hemingway-unpublished.html)\" by Edwin McDowell, published July 25, 1985. However, Project Gutenberg is listing [The Collected Stories](http://www.gutenberg.us/articles/ernest_hemingway:_the_collected_stories) as not having a story called 'Crossroads' in it, leading me to believe that the McDowell was either wrong or the story was pulled before publication for some reason.\n\nHowever, I cannot easily get my hands on a digital or physical copy of the Collected Works from Random House's 'Everyman Series' find a primary source for the damn quote anywhere. For all I know, the quote was made up for that tiny chunk of biography by a journalist putting words in Hemingway's mouth.

We believe that our prayers are heard, and God does his work. If you would read the bible, you would see clearly that there is a very real sense in which God may not do his will unless we pray for it. \n\nIn his example, James seeks to say, \"What is the point of *saying* you wish someone well if you don't actually help them?\" Another example would be, \"What's the point of saying to a beggar, 'I hope someone gives you a dollar', and then leaving, while you yourself have a dollar to give?\"\n\nJames makes a comment that basically means, \"There are some things you are wanting to come about, but not doing it yourself. Go and do them.\"  So, if we can do something, we should do something about it. \n\nNow, the point of the passage as a whole is to say, \"If your faith isn't causing you to love your brothers/sisters, then your faith is weak and will not save you. You do not have faith in the right things.\"\n\nIf you believe that God hears your prayers, as the bible teaches he does, then surely the action of prayer will come out from the faith that prayer is effective? And so we see that prayer *is* a work that comes from faith.\n\nSo we also do not stop praying. There are things we can't do things about (e.g. wars in the world), and even things where we try, but are insufficient (e.g. by giving to charities).  We believe that prayer is powerful and God does his work. \n\nA seven minute doodle which follows C.S.

But it's actually *because* God is omnipotent and omniscient that he can have a plan while knowing everything, while allowing his plan to be seemingly challenged and allowing himself to be convinced. \n\nIf God didn't know everything, there are two ways things could have turned out:\n1. He would have made a plan and would follow through with it no matter what. Whatever he said, he would do, and no amount of prayer could convince him otherwise. In this case, he would be unable to take into account prayers. But we see that prayers are able to be taken into account. This makes it not the case. \n\nOr 2. He would have a plan, but it wouldn't really be a plan, because he would have to change the plan at every prayer and action along the way. But we see that God does have a plan, with prophecy dating back several hundred years before whatever action it was actually happened. He even says, \"I have said it first so that you will know it was me when it comes about; so that you can't say it was your own hands that brought it about.\"\n\nAnd anyway, the bible says that God is all knowing and all powerful and able to be convinced in prayer. So both these options are out. But how can God be all knowing *and* listen to prayers *and* 'change his plan'?\n\nSince God is all knowing, he is able to take every prayer and action of ours into account even at the very formation of the plan. He knows all our prayers and actions before we've made them, and he knows them *because* we will make them. So we have free will and he knows the results of that free will. \n\nIt isn't that the plan changes in response to those prayers. It's that at the 'planning stage', if you will, God knew all our future prayers and actions as though they were the present, and was able to take them into account while planning. \n\nFor example, the bible says that the death for our sins and resurrection after three days of Jesus was the plan even before God created the world. But in the plan, Jesus could only have come about if the Israelites were frequently disobedient. e.g. Jesus was prophesied to be the son of both David and David's son, Solomon. But Solomon was the child of adultery of David and Bathsheba. How could this be? Did God make David commit adultery? No, far from it! But God knew he would, and planned that through that lineage, Jesus would come; it was only because God knew that he could plan.  Of course in the same way, Jesus could not come through David unless Moses did not successfully intervene for the Israelites. \n\nIn the case of Moses and God; did God really feel like destroying the entire Israelite peoples except for Moses at the time? Yes he did, because of how offensive their idolatry was. Did he know that Moses would pray on their behalf? Yes, he did. Did he know he would allow himself to be convinced? Yes he did. \n\nBut even though he knew all these things, it would be wrong to say, \"Even if Moses didn't pray, God still wouldn't have destroyed the Israelites.\" That would be like saying you could boil a cup of water without a heat source. Even though you know what *would* happen (the water will boil), it doesn't happen unless it actually occurs (the heat boils the water). In this case, the heat is the 'middle man' which allows water to move from one stage to the next, (water -> heated -> boil). Without heat, there is no boiling, even though you *know* that it's definitely going to happen. In the same way, God didn't destroy them *because* Moses prayed. If he didn't pray, God would have destroyed them; there would have been nothing to turn his wrath away. His wrath was diverted *because* of Moses; if there were no diversion, his anger would have continued on to destroy the Israelites.\n\nAnd so we see that it's only *because* God is all-knowing and all-powerful that he is able to have both a plan and be 'convinced to change his mind'. If God was not all knowing, he would either, 1. Not be able to be convinced, or 2. Not have a plan.  It's only because he is omniscient that he can take everything into account when he made that plan in the first place. \n\nThere are things that will happen even if we pray, or even if we don't. But there are also things that will happen only if we pray. That's what the bible teaches, and that's why we Christians keep on praying. We believe that Jesus died and was brought back to life, and through this act, we can have a relationship with a God who hears our prayers and takes them into special account. This can only be done through believing in Jesus and entering into the new life he offers us.", "id": "d0fg2j0"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the well thought out reply, but this is where religion loses me.

I tried to keep this short, but if I try to write on the internet in any professional manner, it turns really aggressive. So it's more like a monologue. I reckon it's good for your thinking, even if you don't agree with everything that's said. \n\n_____\n\"I can't believe it because you're making leaps in logic, without having seen anything.\"\n\nI would say to the idea of jumping through hoops, \"Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't true.\" For example, molecules and atoms were refused because, \"We can't see it, how could they exist?\" But now they're so widely accepted because they could be seen. But was their existence any less true because we didn't believe it? No, they existed despite our not understanding them! Many God things are very much the same; they're hard to believe at first. But this doesn't mean you won't get answers or that we can't find any; it just means that if you want to understand, you're going to have to use some effort to find out, just like scientists when they pushed forward microscopes and other technologies. If you want to know, you have to put some effort in. (But if you're willing to read I'll take the time to type out some explanations to things you're confused about.) \n\nNow, I hope you won't take offense at this part, because I mean to show some illogic in science, not to attack: \n\nI would also say that science, particularly in evolution, jumps through a whole lot of high hoops as well. For example, we take the idea of macro-evolution mainly from this evidence that 'Darwin's finches' micro-evolved over time on the Galapagos Islands, as well as fossil records. But do you mean to tell me that at some point, there were asexually reproducing creatures, when suddenly, over time and generations, one mutated to develop male reproductive organs with gametes which contained half the chromosomes of the original creature, while at what must have been exactly the same time another asexual creature of the same species mutated over time to have a female reproductive organ and working reproductive system that can accept the male's organ and gametes, form a working embryo/cell, and those little babies were either male or female and were able to meet one another, mate, mutate, and eventually become the almost infinite amount of species today?\n\n(*phew* that was a long sentence)\n\nWhat I mean to illustrate is that science with evolution (not going into other things now), says, \"Everything is random, and at some point whatever can happen, will happen.\"  But in reality, if I told you that a perfect map of the stars washed up on the beach without any intelligent aid, you'd tell me that that were impossible, that the odds are just so infinitesimally small that it really is, in fact, impossible. Randomness just can't create order. \n\n________\n\nOkay, now let's talk briefly about this plan of God. It should be made clear that this plan isn't a detailed plan in every part. For example, God doesn't plan which cars we drive, or what computer we buy, or what games we play (although he *could*) Instead, he gives us free will. \n\nThen, what is the plan of God? Now, we have to understand that since God is good and we have done evil, we have to be punished; a perfect judge does not and cannot let evil slip by under his nose. This punishment is death. But the plan is that he will come down in human form, live the good and perfect life we were meant to live, and then die instead of us, so that we don't have to die. This exchange can easily be accepted through believing that Jesus is the Son of God, *is* God, and that he did this for us. This 'trade' is easily accepted, but this is also the *only* way to accept it. If we reject Jesus, we reject his offer. If we do, we will get what we deserve; death not only of the body, but of the soul because we have rejected God himself. \n\nSo this grand plan is overarching, and God makes it happen no matter what. It doesn't really matter how it happens, and he's pleased to allow that to be generally under the control of man. Whether they do good or evil, God will bring about the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus. But what about all the in-between? God has a *will* for people, that is, he wants them to do certain things, or be good in certain ways, but it's not that he planned it out for them. God also has a *will*, such as when he wanted to destroy the Israelites (previous post example), but it's not his plan. God's will can be changed, but his plan cannot. \n\nSo when you ask, \"How can God, all powerful, all knowing, be *convinced*?\" The answer is really, \"He can't be convinced to change his final, overarching plan to save everyone who would believe by the death of Jesus. But he has a will that can be called upon. He's complicated, just like a person; he's not a computer which just sorts things logically and methodically, he's more of a parent, who has feelings, sometimes contradictory; although he can be angry with you, he can also at the same moment love you. So, for example, when Moses prayed to God to spare the Israelites instead of destroying them, he was 'playing' (in a sense) to God's feelings of love towards those people. So God is able to decide, \"I won't listen to my anger, even though I have every right to be angry. I will instead show my love to people because Moses asked me.\" The same is the same for other prayers; if we pray something that is resonates, if you will, with his will and character, then he will do it because we asked. If we don't pray, then there are other 'emotions' (for lack of a better word) that he may follow instead. So it's not pointless to pray.\"\n\n _____\n\n\"But if God knows everything, how can we still choose?\" \n\nImagine that you took a video of yourself deciding between vanilla and chocolate ice cream, and in the end you took vanilla. What, or who, made the decision? It was yourself, not the camera. \n\nNow imagine that that video was taken back in time to before you made the decision, and buried and hidden so as to not cause any time paradoxes (play along with the thought experiment here). Now that the video is in the past, does it make your decision for you, or force you to choose vanilla? It doesn't! Even though it exists, even though your choice is known, it doesn't affect your actual choosing of vanilla. \n\nGod being 'out of time', as some Christians say, is very much like this, except it's way more complicated because he remembers/knows every moment of everything that will ever be done by everyone. Add to that that he can also influence whoever he wants through circumstance and otherwise. Conversation for another time, I think. \n\nThe conclusion is though: He knows what choices you will make, but doesn't make the choices for you. \n______\n\n\"Okay, so as a thought experiment it kinda makes some sense. But why believe this over anything else? There are so many other religions and non-religions that have worldviews and beliefs that make sense intellectually and philosophically. Why Christianity?\" \n\nIt's because while everything else is guesswork and extrapolation, Jesus Christ is actual a person. He was born and recorded in a public census, lived a public life, led a public ministry, and then was murdered on a cross, publicly. And then after that, he was raised from a public tomb and appeared to hundreds of people publicly. Taking the example of evolution from before, macro-evolution is deduced from seeing what it looks like on a small scale. But Jesus literally walked on earth, died, and was resurrected, all while saying one consistent thing; that he was God and had come to die for our sins so that we could live for good instead of evil. He also taught what Christianity believes today. It would be foolish to not believe him who came back to life; it'd be silly to say he had no power over death, when he's the only one who has ever conquered death. \n\nI used publicly a lot because it's really important to understand that Jesus' resurrection is a part of recorded history. How can you deny the historicity and legitimacy of the gospels? For one, to say that, \"We need evidence other than the things in the bible\" is like saying, \"We can't believe in Socrates because Plato wrote about him. We need more evidence!\" But don't we understand that the primary source *is* the evidence...? And yet we deny the bible and accept Caesar, of which there are far fewer records. And for two, there is simply plenty of evidence from non-Christian historians that Jesus was alive, dead, and then alive again. \n\n_______\n\n*Weeww* that was a long read. Did you have fun? I'd love to talk more about this, but obviously since I've written a lot, you'll probably also need time to think and research (not to mention keep living out your life).

", "id": "d0zavc7"}, {"comment": "No offence taken at all throughout what was a lengthy read with a number of arguments. At times I would say it did walk a fine line of straying toward condescending, probably in assuming I haven't considered many of these arguments and building me a few straw men along the way for good measure, but that's the nature of the beast and I'm sure was unintentional.\n\nI will give your response further consideration - it deserves it for the effort, and I'll give you a blow by blow, so to speak, explanation of why I personally don't find these arguments convincing even when they are made with some eloquence when I'm on a keyboard. ", "id": "d0zd41s"}, {"comment": "I'll keep this brief as possible. I did re-read and give serious consideration to your monologue. If I came across a convincing argument I sincerely hope I'd be a big enough person  to be able to change my mind. Some of your monologue I found condescending, which I don't think is the most useful stylistic approach to help stray sheep return to the fold, but I realise that works both ways even if unintentional - I'm going to highlight below where you were either intentionally or unintentionally condescending. Best admit from the outset it's unlikely my arguments will alter your views, and as I didn't find your points convincing in the least they won't alter mine. So here goes... \n\n\"I can't believe it because you're making leaps in logic, without having seen anything.\"\n\nThis wasn't my previous argument . I was simply stating that your apologetics for maintaining  a belief in an all knowing, all powerful deity that both has a plan and allows free will are so convoluted it's like your bludgeoning your observations of the world, your \"having seen something\", with a god shaped meat tenderizer. Things may not always be simple, but taking a phenomena and then interpreting it through the prism of your apologetics to someone outside the faith just looks applying a narrative you are convinced of to it. You then go on to treat me like I'm five:\n\n\"Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't true.\" \n\nNever was any argument there. Also agree that the truth of a thing existing isn't predicated on whether you or I believe in it or not. I disagree though that the answers you find for \"god things\" are supported with evidence that is there if I would only make the intellectual effort to try harder to see it. Actually I think I could be forgiven for finding this whole paragraph extremely condescending. Rather than getting your explanations for \"some explanations to things I'm confused about\"(sic) I'll stick to what I find unconvincing in your monologue...\n\nMacro vs micro evolution and abiogenises. \nNot going to argue here in detail. Basically I don't except the distinction you make on macro/micro - and the fact of evolution doesn't rest on the observations of Darwin's Galapagos finches alone as I'm sure you're aware. Also I presume you're not delusional and accept the earth is millions of years old. Just on the face of it, and completely putting science to one side, that would seem to be plenty enough time for populations of the same species to become separated and change gradually due to environmental factors enough that they eventually become new species. Definitely more likely than the idea a super being zapped them all individually into existence.\n\nThen, as far as I can tell, you shift from evolution to abiogenesis. This second argument on the evolution of the first reproductive creatures is simply an argument from ignorance.  We get stuck, we have no explanation, it's so long ago the evidence is difficult to piece together, things look incredulous, so we say this is an argument for God? Actually the only honest thing for me to say is \"I don't know\". It's also not an area I've studied in any great deal, I'm not a scientist and am unqualified to speculate on it. So although I agree it was a long sentence on your part it wasn't a useful one in attempting to convince me that it's necessary to prescribe a deliberate act of creation of a deity as explanation for all the myriad of lifeforms on earth.    \n\n\"What I mean to illustrate is that science with evolution (not going into other things now), says, \"Everything is random, and at some point whatever can happen, will happen.\" But in reality, if I told you that a perfect map of the stars washed up on the beach without any intelligent aid, you'd tell me that  were impossible, that the odds are just so infinitesimally small that it really is, in fact, impossible. Randomness just can't create order.\"\n\nFirstly where does science say that? Does that scientific law have a name? Or are you putting words in science and evolutions mouth? Where does evolution say that? Secondly this perfect map of stars analogy is torturous. If you told me a \"perfect map of the stars\" washed up on the beach I'm not sure what I'd tell you, I'd probably ask to have a look at it! Why put words in my mouth? Has a perfect map of the stars ever washed up on the beach? Actually has anything ever washed up on a beach that didn't do so as a result of either nature or human activity? Why call the cause for things that naturally \"washed up\" god? If a branch washed up on a beach that wasn't native to the island it washed on, (which they of course do), would you attribute it to a storm or God?  The observable universe isn't a perfect map of the the stars, it isn't order from design, it's the the stars themselves. Your analogy doesn't work.\n\n\"Now, we have to understand that since God is good and we have done evil, we have to be punished; a perfect judge does not and cannot let evil slip by under his nose. This punishment is death. But the plan is that he will come down in human form, live the good and perfect life we were meant to live, and then die instead of us, so that we don't have to die. This exchange can easily be accepted through believing that Jesus is the Son of God, is God, and that he did this for us. This 'trade' is easily accepted, but this is also the only way to accept it. If we reject Jesus, we reject his offer. If we do, we will get what we deserve; death not only of the body, but of the soul because we have rejected God himself.\"\n\nI don't buy this story at all. Firstly I missed the boat on where we've I've done evil. I find this narrative very unconvincing. God killing himself as his son and experiencing human suffering via torture as a trade and that's the grand plan? Not even going back to the omniscience thing. But the idea of god dying at the hands of people so people can live after they've died makes no sense to me. I'd say inflicting unnecessary suffering in itself would be evil and that's exactly what god's done here.\n\n\"He's complicated, just like a person; he's not a computer which just sorts things logically and methodically, he's more of a parent, who has feelings, sometimes contradictory; although he can be angry with you, he can also at the same moment love you\"   \n\nThat would seem to be the the crux of it. It's hard to admit the party goes on after you've left, we sometimes feel guilty we ate to much cake or took someone else's slice. Much more comforting to think there's someone watching over us who loves us if we're good and get's angry when we're bad - the ego can't conceive of itself not being. (Sorry as I realise that was condescending). I'm sure you would ask, \"but why do we feel guilty, or even why should we feel guilty? - the answer God!\" But the very simple answer to that this is we are raised in a world with other people, and throughout our development we recognise that other people share a consciousness, they experience pain, they experience jealousy or anger and joy and if we are raised in a social environment we feel the benefits of behaving in these ways. Sometimes we try and take more for ourselves and we are bought into line (hopefully) by parents and teachers who are teaching and reinforcing the benefits of socializing. Then we also have laws and punishments that re-enforce these values. Anyway I'm off topic, but it really does floor me that people believe that it's divine laws that determines what is right and wrong and that without them moral relativism reigns supreme.  \n\n\"The conclusion is though: He knows what choices you will make, but doesn't make the choices for you.\"\n\nI mustn't understand this because it makes zero sense. I found it to be an analogy of impotent  self contradiction. Just to play along with \"your little thought experiment\" though of the hidden camera in this scenario God knows what I will do - he's planned for me to do it, in which case if I \"sin\", say for example I don't believe, it's God's fault and I'm not guilty. God's also not omnipotent as he's powerless to stop me once he's set the plan in motion. As you can tell I didn't dwell on this analogy. Too many holes. Too long an explanation required. Wanting to make sense and believe something isn't the same as something making sense and believing in it. Some people have very long winded and convincing arguments for why there was no moon landing or why September 11 was an inside job.      \n", "id": "d2dox2g"}, {"comment": "That quote is about faith, not prayer.

I've heard a preacher argue that Ephesians 2:8-9 proves that God's saving grace can even be offered to men who have done great evil. The preacher gave King Solomon as an example. Solomon married hundreds of pagan women, he built altars to pagan gods in his old age (after meeting God twice), and he was an all around nasty kind of guy. \n\nBut God even takes Solomon to be his own son: \u201cI have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father\u201d. The preacher emphasized that this proves that our salvation is not dependent on our \"good works\". The more moderate Christians would like these verses to mean that good works are still somehow required, even though they are not technically the source of salvation. But the verse from Ephesians leaves open a convenient crack for anyone who would like to prove that salvation can occur even without good works. It doesn't help that the Bible then reinforces this view in places. The example of Solomon proves that not only can it occur, but it can be a particularly high form of salvation due to Solomon's stature on Earth.

Someone might ask for prayer in church and then they will know their parishoners are praying for them, knowledge which may very well have physiological and psychological effects.\n\nThis process is also sort of implicitly happening all the time. By sharing stories about their prayers, communities of religious people develop mental models of who prays for who under what conditions. This mental model can be used to make predictions about who might be praying for you at what times.\n\nIt's somewhat similar to how so-called \"telepathy\" works in aboriginal culture... It's a group of people together rehearsing a specific pattern of behaviors and perceptions. If a tree falls, it means this. If that happens, you do such-and-such a dance. Because everyone* thinks of the same stories in the same situations and follows the same rules, it allows them to \"know\" what's happening even at a great distance, even if they have almost no facts about what is going on. Just one or two tiny facts can be turned into a rich simulation which can bear unexpected predictions. Because there are so many stories and rules, and because they practice often, prediction becomes sub-conscious. By your old age this looks like telepathy, and in some sense it is, but it's actually just really good really spooky prediction.\n\nIt doesn't take nearly that much for someone to get the warm fuzzy feeling of knowing that people are praying for you.

What's up with the bell thing? There's also a lot of standing in line or sitting quietly. What are the real goals of compulsory education?  Are those goals to instill advanced literary and composition skills so that the students will question what they are told by those in authority and have the ability to gather their fellows into politically active groups? There seems to be very little evidence for the latter.

So the school board thought it was in my best interest to go to a behavioral disorder school, AKA a place to send shitheads for 9 hours so they don't bother other people. The only difference between me and the other students in this school is that I loved learning. But since none of them did, the curriculum was geared towards the (no other way to put this) dumbasses. \n\nClasses consisted of a room no bigger than hotel room, a pissed off \"teacher\" who hated everyone/thing and was gods fucking gift to the Illinois School Board, and 5-8 students. Ages varied from 7yo -20yo in some rooms. My class was 7, me being the youngest at 12, but the only student in that room that knew how to read a clock and do basic math.I went from trigonometry to 4+4=?.\n\n\nThis place was hell. If you acted up (which varied based on how much the teacher like you), they would lead you into a padded room and take both arms and a leg and push you in the corner. after 10 minutes, they would let one leg go, 10 minutes later and arm then the other in 10 minutes.\n\nNo desks could face each other.

So it was all dropped in the name of equality.\n\nThe reason tests became so necessary is because kids (stereotypical: poor and black) were \"graduating\" high school unable to read or write even a basic sentence. \n\nThe reason: The USA wanted the top 10% academically inclined kids to go to college and the rest could go work on the farm/factory.

My vet med teacher was fed up with none of us knowing about checks/addressing letters/giving change that she spent a week or two going over just those basic things, because she knew nobody else would teach us. It was great, almost ten years later I STILL use a lot of what she taught us just in those few weeks.  \n\nIt's funny though, because I hated school. Loathed it. I missed so much school that my teachers would be surprised if I showed up on Tuesdays (I just hated going on Tues), I never turned in my homework (even if I did it.

But at Skill Center (which is where these off campus classes were held) I could focus, I was interested, I learned SO much, and I got all A's and B's. If there were days when my actual high school didn't have school (usually teacher development or something) I would beg my mom to still drive me to skill center (since students from all around the county went there, they usually had school still if i didn't) so I didn't miss anything. I was excited to learn. I can't even begin to explain how different it was there than at a normal school though. We had tests but not a lot of homework. If there was homework, it was because we ran out of time in class, and almost everything we learned was relevant to the class. I learned how to take blood pressure and temperature, how to properly make a bed and wash my hands, how to use masks and gloves properly. We had models and videos to help us learn. We also wrote papers and did a LOT of math, but it pertained to the subject.

It brought my GPA up a lot, and gave me a lot of credits I wouldn't have otherwise earned (Like I said, I hated school, and failed most of my classes).

There is a lot of controversy around this very topic, because many experts in education believe that, for a number of reasons, standardized tests are actually a poor indicator of what students actually know.  Here are some of the various reasons why:\n\n1. Many outside factors influence test scores.  I personally knew a student with a serious medical condition who underwent dialysis every evening, and this student could not function well until about mid-day.  Early morning tasks were generally very difficult for him because his mind and body were not operating at 100%.  And, as luck would have it, all the standardized tests *all year long* were administered in the morning.  And this is an extreme case, for sure, but many other factors can also impact students' performance on a day-to-day basis:  a death in the family, an abusive home life, unstable living situations or even outright homelessness, hell, breaking up with a significant other can have a big impact.\n2. Standardized tests measure only factual knowledge.  That's just the nature of being standardized, there's no way around it without de-standardizing the assessments.  To some degree, standardized test questions can require interpretation (e.g. \"use the graph to answer the following questions\") and analysis (e.g. \"which of the following best describes the theme of this paragraph\").  However, even when tests attempt to address these essential life skills, the provided three-five choices undermine the intent of the question by reducing it to a process of elimination.  If three kids each identify the correct theme of a paragraph from a list of four choices, it's very possible that one of them could have written a 1000-word essay on the theme, one might have been able to figure it out through logical reasoning, and one might have just stabbed wildly in the dark.  All three students will get the same score.\n3. On a standardized test, quality of teaching is secondary to the content of teaching.  This is a problem because, as any seasoned teacher will tell you, knowing content is only a small part of the job.  Teachers are responsible for helping kids develop a great deal of life skills, something that would have fallen primarily to parents and families less than 200 years ago.  Teachers have to help kids learn social skills, manners, societal values, ethics, organization, regulating emotions, and in many cases even basic hygiene.  Furthermore, even within specific content areas like math and reading, the ultimate goal is NOT to teach kids factual knowledge (which is all that standardized tests are concerned with).  The main objective is to teach kids how to think critically and *learn for themselves*.  How to find information using resources like the internet and books, what kinds of questions to ask to get to the heart of the issue, how to come up with creative solutions to problems, and the like.  These are the skills that colleges look for, and these are largely the same skills necessary to excel in basically any industry.  Sure, there are a lot of important facts to be gleaned along the way, but they're really just details.  Standardized tests focus on the details and omit the big picture.\n4. The message kids receive from standardized tests is that success is all about fitting into a mold - being \"standardized\", and knowing all the standardized information that kids your age are expected to know.  This can be psychologically confusing, even damaging, as kids begin to look at learning as a collection of facts rather than a process of thinking.  Creativity is punished on a standardized test; there is simply no room for it.  While there are differing philosophies and theories about the nature and purpose of education, one fairly common theme in education today is that learning should be self-directed and engaging.  Standardized tests directly oppose this ideal.\n5. The questions on standardized tests are often poorly written to the point of seriously hindering students' chances of getting the answer correct - even *with* multiple choice.  Students who do not speak or read English well (or at all) are going to have one hell of a time taking a math test that is written in English, even if they're extremely advanced in math.  It's even worse for reading tests - even if a 9-year-old kid could hypothetically read the collected works of Shakespeare and understand them, they're going to fail a standardized test on Clifford the Big Red Dog if it's written in a language they can't read.  And even for kids who are native English speakers, there are still issues.  Some questions utilize a premise that kids have no understanding of or exposure to.  What good is a physics problem about golf to a kid that's never heard of the sport?  If the premise is confusing, it usually complicates the underlying idea that the test is trying to get at.  And finally, we've all seen them, there are those questions that *no one* could be reasonably expected to understand because of how badly they're written.  Sure, the people writing the tests could do a better job and alleviate many of these problems, but with standardization the expectation is that there is some hypothetical set of questions that every child of a certain age *in the entire state or country* should be able to answer.  I'm not sure such a set of questions exists, and I know I'm not the only one with doubts.\n\nI could go on and on about this, I'm really passionate about how awful standardized tests are, but I have shit to do.  I'd suggest reading up on the subject on your own, and absolutely look at both sides, but please stop making the claim that standardized tests are the \"best\" way to measure kids learnings until you have looked into the alternatives.\n\nSource: recently graduated with a BA in education", "id": "d0wkqg5"}, {"comment": "Last time I checked, 1+1=2 regardless of if you are black, white or live in California or Maine.  \n\nLong Edit:  Since my original comment is a little snarky, I'll go into a bit more detail because like you, I'm passionate about this subject, I just happen to view it from the other side.\n\nI've seen your same arguments tossed up every time someone mentions standardized testing and every time I feel like those comments lack any depth to them.  It's actually quite ironic because they sound like they were just memorized and thrown back out there without any actual comprehension.\n\nFor example...\n\n@1 - What is the problem in your example, the test or the unrecognized external factor?  The answer 100% is the unrecognized external factor but instead of addressing the problem, you are pushing the blame to standardized tests.  On the topic of day-to-day external factors such as short term illness, these would not present a longstanding effect on the results of the tests.  In short, getting one bad grade on a test should not have any realistic effect overall on the scores for the student.  \n\n@2 - Is factual knowledge not a majority of what is being taught in schools regardless?  Let's also explore what factual knowledge actually is, it's science, math, history, algebra, trig, programming, geography, biology, foreign languages, etc.  It's literally everything except specifically the creative side (more on this later).  \n\nYou bring up that testing of someone ability to interpret and analyze a paragraph has faults but that's an assumption based on the test only providing a certain amount of available answers.  Why isn't it possible to have non-predetermined answers to a question?  Even if every answer needed to be independently evaluated by a 3rd party, then that would still provide a more accurate standardization than the alternative of having each teacher creating their own test and then interpreting it their own way.\n\n@3 - Quality of teaching is 100% on the teachers being able to teach the content.  Your first sentence is exactly why we NEED standardization because the implication is that learning is more important than what is being learned.  Further to that, the differentiation of learning factual information and learning information for themselves is trying to split the same exact thing.  Regurgitating a formula or some memorized facts is not what standardized testing is actually testing.  That's what people use as a strawman to attack it.  A more appropriate example would be something like a math problem where they tell you the problem, you have to interpret it, then use your knowledge and critical thinking to decide what formula should be used to solve the problem and then finally being able to utilize that formula to produce the answer.  The depth being used to answer these questions is a hell of a lot more than just \"what is the capital of illinois\".\n\nSecondly, the idea of not knowing the information but being able to find the answers is good in theory, but should you have to google how to do something every time it comes up?  If I'm interviewing two people for a job, the first one responds to a question by saying they would look up the answer and the other one answers the question directly, I'm going to hire the one who doesn't need to rely on external resources in order to get a response.\n\nThis is the big picture.  \n\n@4 - If there is one thing that you take out of this conversation it's that misrepresenting standardized testing as just a \"collection of facts\" is simply not understanding what standardized testing is actually testing.  I went into this in the previous section, but the idea that it's just memorizing and recalling facts is one of the most misguided understandings of these types of tests.  I can't stress how much even simple questions can infuse critical thinking as a core aspect of answering the question correctly.\n\n@5 - This makes 3 out of the 5 comments you've made on the topic into strawmen.  \"Hey, let's treat people who are not native speakers as native speakers!\"  I honestly want to know why you think that this is even logical.  It's not practical.  It's not critical.  Standardization doesn't pretend that every student should get the same exact grade.  Standardization is about being able to address problems in a more accurate fashion.  In short, these types of testing are going to find people who may be having trouble with english that is not being recognized so that they can get the help that is needed to catch them up to the standard.  \n\nHonestly, I can't even fathom someone using the argument that anyone with a brain would expect someone who doesn't even know the language the test is in to have any bearing on their intelligence.  These are the types of comments that really just infuriate me and it's only slowing down progress rather than making anything better.\n\nTruthfully, most of this comment just boils down to teaching coincidentally.  If a student doesn't know about common social events in the most broad sense, then blaming the test is a bit misguided again.  This is another place where you need to be able to think critically when taking these types of tests.  You don't need to know what Golf is specifically if you can apply critical thinking to the questions themselves.  If the concepts are being taught well enough, then you can apply those concepts even without full knowledge of the intricacies of the topic.  Hell, that's a major part of the high level jobs right now.\n\nLastly, I just want to address your comment about standardized tests being the \"best\" way to measure kids learning.  Standardization is necessary for students in order to progress across the board.  That standardization is going to happen at some level.  It's either going to be done at the teachers level which currently has practically no regulations on it and no meaningful checks and balances.  Or, it's going to be done on the student level (which encompasses both the student and teacher) in order to have the checks and balances.  Without any form of standardizations, then you have teachers teaching whatever they want and students not being held accountable for what they are learning which is practically the system we have right now.  ", "id": "d0wlal5"}, {"comment": "> What is the problem in your example, the test or the unrecognized external factor? The answer 100% is the unrecognized external factor but instead of addressing the problem, you are pushing the blame to standardized tests.\n\nThis is a fair point, but as it stands, standardized tests absolutely do not take external factors into account.  The external factors I mentioned cannot be addressed overnight, and so it is up to testmakers to compensate for different background situations.  And I noticed you used \"short-term illness\" as an example, when that severely misrepresents the majority of these external influences - e.g. an ongoing divorce, patterns of parental abuse or neglect, persistent homelessness, and lifelong medical conditions.\n\n> Is factual knowledge not a majority of what is being taught in schools regardless? \n\nNo, it's not.  I addressed that in my original argument.  Factual information is not really a high priority either for teachers or students, nor should it be (in my opinion).\n\n> Let's also explore what factual knowledge actually is, it's science, math, history, algebra, trig, programming, geography, biology, foreign languages, etc.\n\nMath is not factual knowledge, or if that's how it's taught it's not very useful.  Math should be about processes of logical reasoning.  The same goes for history - the facts only serve to illustrate greater patterns of human behavior across time.  And science classes are absolutely not about factual knowledge.  Sure, there are plenty of important scientific \"facts\" to learn, but far more important is the process of scientific thinking that allows people to reach *new* scientific discoveries.  If kids are just memorizing facts from a textbook, they are absolutely *not* learning science - or at least, not very thoroughly.  Foreign language is not in the least about factual knowledge, I have no idea where you got that from.  Let me also point out that you omitted a number of essential subjects, including reading, writing, art, and music - none of which can be taught effectively through mere factual knowledge.\n\n> You bring up that testing of someone ability to interpret and analyze a paragraph has faults but that's an assumption based on the test only providing a certain amount of available answers. Why isn't it possible to have non-predetermined answers to a question? Even if every answer needed to be independently evaluated by a 3rd party, then that would still provide a more accurate standardization than the alternative of having each teacher creating their own test and then interpreting it their own way.\n\nThat would be a step in the right direction, but the majority of standardized tests kids are asked to take are still multiple choice, which is what I am particularly against.\n\n> Quality of teaching is 100% on the teachers being able to teach the content.\n\nThen, my friend, we have very different ideas of what constitutes effective teaching.  In my professional opinion, effective teaching has as much or more to do with managing a classroom environment, building relationships with students, improving students' critical thinking skills, and imparting life lessons as with teaching content.\n\n> Regurgitating a formula or some memorized facts is not what standardized testing is actually testing. That's what people use as a strawman to attack it. A more appropriate example would be something like a math problem where they tell you the problem, you have to interpret it, then use your knowledge and critical thinking to decide what formula should be used to solve the problem and then finally being able to utilize that formula to produce the answer.\n\nDepends somewhat on the standardized test, and moreso on the subject.  You conveniently used math in your example, which is the one subject where I'll concede that standardized testing is ONE of several valid methods of assessment, for precisely the reasons you stated.  Let me give you a different scenario - how about a standardized test on reading, where a student is asked to read a paragraph and answer the question \"what is the theme?\" from a list of four possible answers?  How is that an effective way to determine a students ability to analyze a text for meaning?\n\n> Secondly, the idea of not knowing the information but being able to find the answers is good in theory, but should you have to google how to do something every time it comes up? If I'm interviewing two people for a job, the first one responds to a question by saying they would look up the answer and the other one answers the question directly, I'm going to hire the one who doesn't need to rely on external resources in order to get a response.\n\nThat's not the intention of the method of teaching I described in my original comment.  As previously stated, many facts are gleaned along the way, but take the Reddit meme about the mitochondria being the powerhouse of the cell - is it really essential information for more than a handful of students?  And if that information later becomes essential to them, they will be well equipped not only to *find* that information using their resources, but to *learn* from that information and memorize that fact of their own accord.\n\n> I can't stress how much even simple questions can infuse critical thinking as a core aspect of answering the question correctly.\n\nI have two problems with this statement.  First of all, the key word you used is \"can\".  Yes, it is *possible* to make standardized test questions that require some degree of critical thinking, but many tests are severely lacking in this regard.  Second, we return to the issue of multiple choice, which has the potential to eliminate that all-important aspect of critical thought.  By high school (if not middle school), most kids have figured out - or been told outright - that if you can eliminate two answers that you know are wrong, you have a 50% chance or better of getting the question correct without applying yourself at all.\n\n> \"Hey, let's treat people who are not native speakers as native speakers!\" I honestly want to know why you think that this is even logical.\n\nIt's not logical, but *it actually happens*.  That's where my argument comes from.  As part of my undergrad study in education, I was exposed to a number of situations where students with limited reading/writing/speaking skills in the English language were provided absolutely no supports to take the same tests as their English-speaking peers.  It's not a strawman if it's the reality of the situation, which, sadly, it is.\n\n> Standardization doesn't pretend that every student should get the same exact grade. Standardization is about being able to address problems in a more accurate fashion.\n\nThen the tests administered by Pearson under the guise of \"standardized testing\" are not standardized by your own definition.  I'd even go so far as to say that we don't use standardized tests at all in this country, given this criteria for standardization.\n\n> Honestly, I can't even fathom someone using the argument that anyone with a brain would expect someone who doesn't even know the language the test is in to have any bearing on their intelligence.\n\nNeither can I - that's why it's such a problem that this occurs all over the country.\n\n> Standardization is necessary for students in order to progress across the board.\n\nThis makes no sense at all.  What about the entirety of human history before standardized tests existed?  Did students simply not progress?  Where is your logic here?\n\n> the teachers level which currently has practically no regulations on it and no meaningful checks and balances.\n\nThis is where the real problem lies, I will agree.  We need a higher standard for teachers in this country.  Unfortunately, we seem to be seeing a trend in the opposite direction (my home state in particular).  Furthermore, if we are going to hold teachers to a higher standard, they deserve to be paid in kind.  Why are there so many bad teachers?  One big reason is because some of the best potential teachers realize that they can receive better compensation for their skills in other fields.  I've seen it firsthand.  But this is a different topic and I'd rather not go down that road.\n\n> Without any form of standardizations, then you have teachers teaching whatever they want and students not being held accountable for what they are learning which is practically the system we have right now.\n\nOk, so right off the bat, you've got a glaring logical fallacy.  Just because we remove standardized tests does not mean that all standardization will fail across the board.  Beyond that, teachers have never been able to teach \"whatever they want\", and there are all sorts of checks and balances in place from principles, district administration, textbook publishers, state legislation, and the Common Core (which has no standardized tests attached, and allows teachers to present standardized ideas in whatever way best suits their particular group of students).  And your assumption that standardized tests are the only way to hold students accountable for their learning just demonstrates your ignorance of the entire field of education.  Anyone who has worked in the capacity of a teacher or administrator can offer you plenty of other forms of assessments that are *more* valid and *more* rigorous than standardized tests.\n\nBut suffice to say that you will not be able to convince me of your point of view without presenting me a body of literature equivalent to that which I studied during the last three years, so I suggest we agree to disagree.", "id": "d0xvqis"}, {"comment": "> The external factors I mentioned cannot be addressed overnight, and so it is up to testmakers to compensate for different background situations.\n\nDisagree entirely.  Tests can help recognize an issue but it's up to the teachers to actually do their job and teach students.  I think you have the misconception that standardized testing negates teachers from actually teaching.  \n\n>No, it's not. I addressed that in my original argument. Factual information is not really a high priority either for teachers or students, nor should it be (in my opinion).\n\nI don't think you understand what is encompassed when factual information is brought up.  I listed it originally, but it's practically every single different subject that you take.  If you are working through balancing a formula, the basis of that is learning and understanding the factual information which is then applied in a critical way to get the answer.  \n\nSo, saying that factual information shouldn't be a priority is like saying you don't need to learn a formula OR how to use a formula in order to calculate an answer.  It's missing practically all of the learning when you take out the factual information.  All that's left is guessing really.\n\n>Math is not factual knowledge, or if that's how it's taught it's not very useful.\n\nAgain, I don't think you realize how broad factual knowledge actually is.  It's an extremely simple concept that is made infinitely more complex when people try to pigeonhole it into the belief that it is bad.  You want to do anything in math?  You have to have the factual knowledge to understand what you are looking at.  Do I use this formula here or do I use this formula here?  Well, I have to know and understand the formulas that I could use in order to actually apply them.  \n\n>Then, my friend, we have very different ideas of what constitutes effective teaching.\n\nThen I think you should honestly get a refund on your education.  I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but you are suggesting that teachers teach whatever they want rather than teach what other teachers of the same grade are teaching.  Why would a teacher teaching 5th grade in one school be teaching something vastly different than a teacher at a different school teaching 5th grade? \n\nWhen you go to school to become a teacher, you learn HOW to teach.  This means being able to understand different types of students and how they learn.  Your effectiveness as a teacher is taking the content and getting the kids to learn it.  \n\n>In my professional opinion, effective teaching has as much or more to do with managing a classroom environment, building relationships with students, improving students' critical thinking skills, and imparting life lessons as with teaching content.\n\nEffective teaching is about the student learning the material.  Managing the classroom environment, building relationships, etc., are all methods that teachers can use in order to teach the material.  This is an important distinction because it's the difference between a teacher and a babysitter.  Babysitters help kids wipe their noses, teachers get kids to learn.  \n\n> You conveniently used math in your example,\n\nI conveniently use math, science, accounting, home economics, biology, statistics, music, medicine, foreign languages, and hell even art can be used directly with standardized testing without the need for analysis.  \n\nReading is really the only subject you CAN use as a counterpoint.  I also addressed this by pointing out that standardized testing doesn't mean that everything is built into a multiple choice question.  There isn't anything saying that you can't have written answers.  Essay answers are a part of many main stream tests.  These just need to meet a certain criteria when they are evaluated so they maintain the standardization.\n\n>is it really essential information for more than a handful of students? And if that information later becomes essential to them, they will be well equipped not only to find that information using their resources, but to learn from that information and memorize that fact of their own accord.\n\nNo offense, but this is bullshit from start to finish.  Again, I'm not trying to be an ass, but you need to actually pay attention to what your argument is.  You are comparing someone learning the information to someone who just learns how to find the information.  In EVERY scenario, the better option is for them to learn the actual information.  Further to that, I have no clue why you think that this prevents someone from knowing how to look up the information at a later date.  Logically, if someone knows more information, they are able to find what they are looking for more directly because they can understand the content more easily.\n\n>First of all, the key word you used is \"can\". Yes, it is possible to make standardized test questions that require some degree of critical thinking, but many tests are severely lacking in this regard.\n\nSo, the answer is to take a methodology that has huge amounts of benefits for every level of education and throw it out the window because the tests could be better?  Conversely, you'll completely ignore the fact that the current teaching methodology has ZERO accountability to it.  It's like saying that literally having nothing is better than standardized testing.  I have severe doubts in your education if you don't see the problem here.\n\n>It's not logical, but it actually happens. \n\nWhy the hell would you blame standardized testing for a teachers inability to recognize a problem?  Further to that, standardized testing is a way to actually CATCH these problems before the student falls drastically behind. \n\nI just can't stress how much blaming standardized testing for this situation is absolutely moronic.  It's the solution, not the problem.\n\n>Then the tests administered by Pearson under the guise of \"standardized testing\" are not standardized by your own definition. I'd even go so far as to say that we don't use standardized tests at all in this country, given this criteria for standardization.\n\nSo, you are saying that something being \"standardized\" isn't actually standardized?  I don't understand the rational about it.\n\n>This makes no sense at all. What about the entirety of human history before standardized tests existed? Did students simply not progress? Where is your logic here?\n\nSorry, I used some context here and hoped that you would understand it but you didn't and this is why it's so frustrating dealing with someone like you.\n\nStandardization (... not just testing ...) in general is necessary in order for students to progress.  For example, we've always used something to the effect of grade school, middle school, high school, college, as a progression of standardization.  This could also be described as 1st grade, 2nd grade, 3rd grade, etc.  At each point, students are expected to have a certain amount of knowledge.  You've heard the phrase \"can read at a 5th grade level\", that's USING the standardization of reading at a 5th grade level in order to describe their skills.  \n\n> We need a higher standard for teachers in this country. Unfortunately, we seem to be seeing a trend in the opposite direction (my home state in particular).\n\nThen why are you opposed to one of the most beneficial methods of evaluating teachers?  The results of these tests are going to show the trends in a teachers skills.  If 95% of the teachers have average class grades of 75 and the other 5% are showing class grades of 40-50, then those teachers are underperforming.  These things can factor in issues with bad students or socio-economic statuses or any different deflection that typically comes up here.  If a majority of your class isn't passing tests that a substantial majority of the other classes ARE passing, then it narrows down the problem very handily.\n\n>Furthermore, if we are going to hold teachers to a higher standard, they deserve to be paid in kind. \n\nI'm not holding teachers to a higher standard.  I'm holding teachers to A standard.  There's a difference.  Further to that, I disagree that teachers need to be paid more in general especially within the current unionization of the profession.  I would absolutely agree to pay teachers who are performing more but right now there is no way to actually know if they are.  \n\n>Why are there so many bad teachers?\n\nI could write you a novel on why this is the case but the highlights come down to shitty administrators within a system that doesn't punish poor performance.  This is coincidentally why I am all for standardized tests.\n\n>Beyond that, teachers have never been able to teach \"whatever they want\", and there are all sorts of checks and balances in place from principles, district administration, textbook publishers, state legislation...\n\nI'm very familiar with the checks and balances that happen and I think you are grossly misrepresenting the regulations on these systems.  \n\n> And your assumption that standardized tests are the only way to hold students accountable for their learning just demonstrates your ignorance of the entire field of education.\n\nI still don't think you realize what \"standardized\" actually means.  I really am not trying to be a jerk here but anything can be standardized.  Even those assessments that you say are \"more valid\" and \"more rigorous\" than standardized tests.  I mean, are you that caught up on the fact that they are *called* standardized tests that you don't realize that everything is built on a standardization in the first place?

I had to work hard to get my grades up so I could go to that program. I took summer school every year to make up the classes I failed during the first year before ROP. After graduating high school I opened an auto body shop and did really well. Now I am still in the car industry. I even went to college which is largely due to ROP. \n\nSo the shop classes taught me a skill I have used to earn an honest living ever since. It also made me focus in other classes.

In the 1700's and 1800's everything was \"on the job training\" through apprenticeship programs.  Education was a thing for the rich - and it was a way to babysit the children of the rich.  As the middle class grew and there was less need for kids on the farm and apprenticeship programs died out compulsory education took root as a way to \"babysit\" the kids of working class families.  Meanwhile the agenda of making them \"better citizens\" was hammered out so by the time they were of legal adult age (18) they'd be able to enter the country's workforce with a basic set of skills.  It wasn't until the post-industrial era that thing shifted away from pragmatic programs (vo-tech, agricultural, business/clerical, etc) to an emphasis on college prep.  Post WWII there was way more supply of skilled workers than there was demand.  Something was needed to babysit the troops till the economy got better.  The push toward 'white collar' jobs was emphasized and this race to push everything through K-12 into higher education (*aided my gobs of financial aid and an explosion of colleges and universities across the country - thank you GI Bill*).  It became a cold arms race of credentialism.  Jobs you used to need experience for required high school diplomas.  Jobs that required high school diplomas required college degrees.  Jobs that used to require college degrees now require accreditation, a bachelors degree, and often now a masters.  The simple fact is many college students graduating today are underemployed and doing the jobs high school graduates used to do for the same pay without the loan debt.  This is compounded by a K-12 system more focused on mass producing crops of students who can all pass the same assessment test but have no practical skills nor any useful knowledge or are independent free thinkers.

It is meant to give people who needs to be heard a platform to speak from.  \n\nNow to why she got the prize.

This was under a pseudonym for security reasons,  but it was being quoted all over the place. People suspected that her parents (who own several schools in the district) helped her.  \n\nHowever,  after the NYT documentary and multiple international interviews  people started to understand that this girl is special. While her grasp of international politics, education and religion might not be on par with a scholar, it was certainly way beyond any regular Joe, and her way of communicating it was frankly amazing, even when judging her by grown-up standards. At this point she was 13.  Over a few years she got a  broader attention, receiving international acclaim and rewards.\n\nIn 2012 the taliban had enough of being undermined singlehandedly by a little girl and decided to assassinate her. On October 9.th a band of taliban searched school busses asking for her by name, and when they found her, they shot her 3 times at point blank range. Now, if it's just pure luck, taliban incompetence or just the fact that even for taliban warriors it's pretty damn hard to kill a teenage girl up close,  nobody knows, but she survived despite severe wounds.  \n\nThe taliban doubled down and reiterated their intention to kill her, and this time included her family. This virtually ignited the international media. Apparently vowing to kill an articulate teenage girl you have already put in a coma doesn't resonate well with Western values. \n\nAfter recovering, she dropped all pseudonyms and went right back to advocacy, figuring there was no point trying to hide anything anymore since they would clearly be able to find her again.  \n\nThis is the short version.

So if any Catholic corrects me, please do take my answers with a grain of salt.\n\nOkay, sanctification can mean a few things, but in general, it usually refers to being made holy, which, according to Catholic belief, Mary is, since she was born sinless according to the Immaculate Conception. Beatification is being recognized as able to intercede on behalf of others, and canonization is a step further, being recognized as a saint. All saints are beatified. Mary is recognized as very important because it was through her body and purity that Jesus was conceived and born, which is a big deal, as the mother of God, also known as Queen of Heaven. Now, as a Protestant, I think the veneration is a bit much, but well, there's a reason I'm not Catholic, lol.\n\nWell, most Christian denominations believe we get new bodies in heaven; it's not necessarily a purely Catholic view, because it's stated quite explicitly in many verses.

This quote does a good job of revealing a key flaw in his epistemology. He would have us revere traditional societal forms because to do otherwise is a function of the impetuous arrogance of youth. We are but a momentary flowering at the end of a long stem. However in fetishising traditional forms such as the church, the guilds and monarchy he ignores their own revolutionary roots. A cursory look at the mid and late Roman Empire shows a radical movement which overthrew traditional polytheistic modes of worship. It subverted the monotheism of Sol Invictus; grafting a shockingly new set of ethics. Yet despite this new religion:\n\n> demolishing the social edifice and pulverize even the ashlars of its foundations in order to erect a novel structure\n\n\nMella does not paint it as parricide, murder, or suicide.\n\n\nHe saves that distinction only for the ideas which he found swirling in his own time. He would sentence us to intellectual and social stasis. To worship the forms bought us by earlier bold revolutionaries with their idealistic theories. Never to be bold or idealistic ourselves.\n\n\nThis self-interested hypocrisy, peddled by a man who was well served by the status quo, leaves no room for change or development. Condemning us to accept society as we find it regardless of its imperfections. A Carlist world view fails because every tradition was once a new and dangerous innovation. To turn off the well is to deny our obligation to bequeath to future generations that which we have benefited from.\n\n\nIbn Khaldun's quote by contrast is much more interesting and nuanced despite its lack of verbosity. He does not claim that we should shun tradition. Rather that to blindly follow it, as opposed to assessing their merits to the best of our intellectual faculties, is the obligation of any man whose mind is truly alive. Failing to do so does not honour the memories of those who went before but is, rather, an insult.

If one can, then it clearly doesn't have free will but is predetermined. On the other hand, if one cannot predict the behavior, one could take that as an operational definition that the organism has free will \u2026 The real reason why we cannot predict human behavior is that it is just too difficult. We already know the basic physical laws that govern the activity of the brain, and they are comparatively simple. But it is just too hard to solve the equations when there are more than a few particles involved \u2026 So although we know the fundamental equations that govern the brain, we are quite unable to use them to predict human behavior. This situation arises in science whenever we deal with the macroscopic system, because the number of particles is always too large for there to be any chance of solving the fundamental equations. What we do instead is use effective theories. These are approximations in which the very large number of particles are replaced by a few quantities. An example is fluid mechanics \u2026 I want to suggest that the concept of free will and moral responsibility for our actions are really an effective theory in the sense of fluid mechanics. It may be that everything we do is determined by some grand unified theory. If that theory has determined that we shall die by hanging, then we shall not drown. But you would have to be awfully sure that you were destined for the gallows to put to sea in a small boat during a storm. I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road. \u2026 One cannot base one's conduct on the idea that everything is determined, because one does not know what has been determined. Instead, one has to adopt the effective theory that one has free will and that one is responsible for one's actions. This theory is not very good at predicting human behavior, but we adopt it because there is no chance of solving the equations arising from the fundamental laws. There is also a Darwinian reason that we believe in free will: A society in which the individual feels responsible for his or her actions is more likely to work together and survive to spread its values.\n\nFrom *Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays*"], [4, "Maybe off topic, anyone has the background of this?\n"], [3, "Why can't I be predestined to never get killed crossing the road by waiting until it's clear?

The moment you were born and the moment you will die both exist right now, and will exist forever. We are just not capable of accessing anything beyond the current moment.

Yes we are in space time, and yes bending that affects time. \n\nBut time is not a spatial dimension its a temporal one. But what does that mean? \n\nIt's all motion, really. There is no way to measure time, aside from motion. You age due to the relative motion of your components.  If all of those move at a different rate, on a spaceship, than people on earth, then you age at a different rate. \n\nIf nothing moves in the universe, there is no time. If there is no time, nothing can move. \n\nThere are 3 dimensions of space, within which stuff can exist, and there is one of time, within which they may move. Right? If you make 3D space with 3D objects in it, they cant move. They need to be on \"pause\" if you have multiple frames, or press play, now there is time. Except time doesnt work as some universal constant, it is determined by the relative speed between objects, sort of, because in every frame all observations must agree. So if im moving really fast away from earth, earth observes time for me, as being slow. But if I am moving away from earth, earth is also moving away from me, if I'm the reference frame, in which case time on earth must be moving slowly in comparison to me. \n\nIt can get kind of complex to understand properly, and  there is a lot I dont know as well, I dont have an academic education in quantum physics, but motion and time, are very tightly linked together.

If one can, then it clearly doesn't have free will but is predetermined. On the other hand, if one cannot predict the behavior, one could take that as an operational definition that the organism has free will \u2026 The real reason why we cannot predict human behavior is that it is just too difficult. We already know the basic physical laws that govern the activity of the brain, and they are comparatively simple. But it is just too hard to solve the equations when there are more than a few particles involved \u2026 So although we know the fundamental equations that govern the brain, we are quite unable to use them to predict human behavior. This situation arises in science whenever we deal with the macroscopic system, because the number of particles is always too large for there to be any chance of solving the fundamental equations. What we do instead is use effective theories. These are approximations in which the very large number of particles are replaced by a few quantities. An example is fluid mechanics \u2026 I want to suggest that the concept of free will and moral responsibility for our actions are really an effective theory in the sense of fluid mechanics. It may be that everything we do is determined by some grand unified theory. If that theory has determined that we shall die by hanging, then we shall not drown. But you would have to be awfully sure that you were destined for the gallows to put to sea in a small boat during a storm. I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road. \u2026 One cannot base one's conduct on the idea that everything is determined, because one does not know what has been determined. Instead, one has to adopt the effective theory that one has free will and that one is responsible for one's actions. This theory is not very good at predicting human behavior, but we adopt it because there is no chance of solving the equations arising from the fundamental laws. There is also a Darwinian reason that we believe in free will: A society in which the individual feels responsible for his or her actions is more likely to work together and survive to spread its values.\n\nFrom *Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays*", "id": "d4wf55u"}], [{"comment": "Maybe off topic, anyone has the background of this?\n", "id": "d4vt7il"}, {"comment": "Reverse image search yielded [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/carbonnyc/12697269255/)", "id": "d4w0fup"}], [{"comment": "Why can't I be predestined to never get killed crossing the road by waiting until it's clear?

Mathematically and logically we can posit its existance, in fact its absolutely necessary for reality to exist, however we cant measure it in the way science has been focused to measure. \n\nThis is not a failing of this ideology but in fact a failing of the way we have chosen to use science. scientific method is only useful for materialist questions so thats the paradigm it has ended up supporting. That is tautology and not helpful. Now that its becoming especially dogmatic its even more unhelpful because we obviously have perhaps endless things to learn which could potentially invalidate any of our beliefs. Dogmatism is in my opinion always unhelpful even when you're very sure you're correct. It needlessly clouds judgement. Its most obvious when we have fools telling us dinosaurs aren't real and other things like that, but its far more subtle when someone tells you 'nothing outside of what we can measure is real because we can't measure it'.\n\nWell thats occams razors version of truth. Its probably not true so it isnt. But what we decide is the most probable is also due to our paradigms.\n\n\n\nTL:DR logic dictates that metaphysical rules necessarily exist, and we can pretty much assume that our monkey senses and primitive technology cannot detect every aspect of reality. \n\n", "id": "d7uleoa"}, {"comment": "U think that ancient Egyptian religion is the correct religion. The one with the sun god and stuff?  You seem way to smart to believe in such a silly concept.  for you to judge wotan and baal silly and not Ra is, well, silly. \nSo you say physical laws are reliant on something. Well we thought that the laws of physics relied on what the matter \"wanted\" to do.  Such as \" the ball wanted to come to rest, therefore it did\".  Now we know that there are very small particles with no mass that interact with the mass particles to make them move about. Anything after that we don't know.  And we as a Human race are trying to figure it out. But from a standpoint of what works best. Science has taken us much further than the 10s of thousands of years religious nonsense has. In fact if we do find the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything, we will probably have the technology to pass the answer and method of aquiring the answer to generations that live until the death of our sun. And probably past that.  If you know something I don't regarding this and I am overlooking something. Please spell it out in layman's terms. Because I would love to know. At this point (especially after the Egyptian comment you made) I feel like I'm just feeding the troll", "id": "d7uq71o"}, {"comment": "Lol im not trolling, sorry that it comes across like that.  I don't believe theres such a thing as a 'God' in that sense. A magical being watching us trying to fuck with us and make us follow rules like dont wear two types of cloth, or sacrifice me a goat and so on. I think thats primitive and illogical. However I do look to ancient traditions and philosophies and draw wisdom from them. To not do so is to start again like a child and is highly wasteful and inefficient way of obtaining wisdom.\n\nI sincerely believed atheism was the most logical and correct position to hold. I was firmly a critical rationalist and hard materialist. I believed in determinism.  However I dont hold that view anymore and its quite hard to explain it properly without asking you to read a bunch of books and have some experiences that I also had.\n\nI don't believe in such a thing as \"ra the sun god\" that is very much so a laymens understanding of what the Egyptians believed and i'd encourage you to look deeper into the culture that literally taught the west Science especially astronomy. A culture whose date is now very convincingly being pushed back thousands of years similar to Gobeki Tepe being dated at 12,000 ish years. \n\nI believe that the Egyptians in their most ancient form were highly sophisticated at trancendental meditation. There studies exist which show the mental states of people in a meditative trance are not the same as just relaxing or sleeping. They are literally in a heightened state of awareness.  If you are using this state to contemplate things its highly beneficial. Especially if you are using what we now call 'psychadelic drugs' which alter our neurochemistry in ways which allows patterns of thought which exceed that of non-altered (obviously not talking about the 'dude weed lmaos' here but as I mentioned earlier people such as the Albert Hoffman, Richard Alpert, Carl Sagan and many others who do not want to publically announce it) people who are litearlly unable to simulate the cathartic effect.\n\nThey spent these states of heightened awareness pondering death, what happens after death, what the purpose of life is, how to lead a life in conjunction with the laws of reality. Their philosophies on life (similar to advaita vedanta) is something like a field of awareness which preceeds matter.   Mind preceeding matter also exists in the theories of some classical western philosophers especially around the 1600s and 1800s if I remember correctly.  However now we think matter preceeds mind. Both are possible but if you can only consider one you will limit the scope o your knowledge. \n\n", "id": "d7w33o4"}, {"comment": "One is based off of objective research, the other is based on mythology that was based on older mythology.

That is the opposite of existentialism, in existentialism, the book already exists without any writing or a title, the painting is already painted without any essence, meaning or purpose. It's the complete opposite. \n\nSome other stuff to consider: the meaning of life is not merely I live because I have kids, or purpose of my life is to protect my wife and my kids/get a job/etc, perhaps that's an ancillary purpose, you could very well be happily married with kids and yet have no purpose and be dead on the inside (Which again is bit different from depression). We are free beings without any interference from anyone else yet they say even the choice to commit suicide is to your own choice, it's a fine line between our ability to choose our meaning and the world around us that perhaps sometimes doesn't allow us to choose it, one example of self-choice is when you are looking down the edge of a high cliff/mountain, the choice to lean a bit forward and fall and die is perhaps the only time where your personal choice is fully yours and that to some is one way of escaping.", "id": "d496zd9"}, {"comment": "I totally agree with everything you wrote here, but it's pretty much a more detailed version of exactly what /u/TheScarfBastard said.

I'd like to believe that the culture would change if the level of education increased but if the culture doesn't value an education then how do you strive to make people more educated? And it has become worse over time. For example several states implemented a high school proficiency test in 2000. If a student failed the test then they would not receive a high school diploma. So many students failed the test that the parents revolted and demanded the standard be lowered, and it was. At some point parents have to become accountable for the failings of their children but they don/t want to do that.\n\nI guess I answered my own question and yours - I don't think education alone will fix the problem due to the trend to move away from personal responsibility and accountability for one's own actions.\n\n>Would you say that a high general religiosity is the issue there? Or that anti-intellectual behaviors would remain at the same level with less religious people?\n\nReligion is a factor, I think, but it's not the only reason nor do I think it's the biggest reason. Religion effects issues such as whether schools should teach sex education and evolution but the cult of ignorance spreads to math and other sciences beyond biology - such as physics. They even spread to liberal arts such as English classes.\n\nStephen Colbert found the crux of the issue that's more relevant to modern times when he coined the term [truthiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness). Here's what he had to say about it:\n\n>\"Truthiness is tearing apart our country, and I don't mean the argument over who came up with the word\u2026\n\n>It used to be, everyone was entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. But that's not the case anymore. Facts matter not at all. Perception is everything. It's certainty. People love the President [George W. Bush] because he's certain of his choices as a leader, even if the facts that back him up don't seem to exist. It's the fact that he's certain that is very appealing to a certain section of the country. I really feel a dichotomy in the American populace. What is important? What you want to be true, or what is true?\u2026\n\n>Truthiness is 'What I say is right, and [nothing] anyone else says could possibly be true.' It's not only that I feel it to be true, but that I *feel* it to be true. There's not only an emotional quality, but there's a selfish quality.\"\n\n^ that quote shows us the state in which anti-intellectualism in this country [USA] has progressed to, but it does not tell us how we got here. Colbert talks about Bush and you asked about religion but this isn't a left vs right or liberal vs conservative because anti-intellectualism crops up in elementary school, long before kids develop a political ideology and as adults the left is guilty of it too. People become dogmatic ideologues who value their beliefs over accuracy of information. Isaac Asimov believed anti-intellectualism has always been there with his quote:\n\n>\"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.\"", "id": "d2vmfq1"}, {"comment": ">  I don't think education alone will fix the problem due to the trend to move away from personal responsibility and accountability for one's own actions.\n\nYeah I'm really wondering why, as the level of education is historically at its peak worldwide, anti intellectualism can rise at the heart of one of the most advanced country. \n\nThat's why I wondered if it wasn't the last stand of a declining religious world, because that's the other striking historical trend IMO. My other guesses would be individualism gone berserk or a rise of inequalities, with poor peoples feeling so alienated that they'd cling to anything to feel better.\n\n> Religion effects issues such as whether schools should teach sex education and evolution but the cult of ignorance spreads to math and other sciences beyond biology - such as physics. They even spread to liberal arts such as English classes.\n\nMy comparison is with Europe. Secularization started rising very early in some areas, and regular  attendance is extremely low everywhere. It's still high for some immigrants but even in these groups it's not rising either. Given the similarities between the two sides of the ocean, I only see religiosity as a big difference.\n\nThese attacks on the education systems must be taken seriously, but it looks like it's not taking hold that much here. A lot of us are just amazed that some areas in the US are so vulnerable to these movements.\n\n> Stephen Colbert found the crux of the issue\n\nOne of the few times I just got up my feet and exulted watching a tv show, it was just so on point even outside the US.\n\n> Isaac Asimov believed anti-intellectualism has always been there\n\nI'll look into it now, I just want to know what's happening.", "id": "d2vnvwu"}, {"comment": "This is only true if you put any stock or value in the words of that vocal minority.

Ted Cruz, the second highest contender for the Republican nomination, was just as bad of a choice. Then there's Hillary Clinton who is seen in dozens of videos lying and changing her stance to fit her agenda and her audience. This ignores numerous allegations and charges of criminal activity going as far back as the 1970s.\n\nWe can talk about almost any social issue to illustrate the point - global warming and evolution are probably the most contentious and it seems to me that these issues wouldn't be contentious at all if we did not have a cult of ignorance here in the United States.

I think the quote is only true in a fairly narrow range. It is true that great literature can cause us to look at a problem in a new way or help us imagine a future that almost seems like a fantasy in our current circumstances.\n\nIn reality, this is often not how we actually end up solving problems. We tried to save ourselves from many infectious diseases for centuries by the power of our scriptures and their stories. It didn't work. We had our great prayer, sacrifice, and devotion to our stories, and it meant nothing in the face of these diseases. What actually ended a disease like Polio was a very careful and measured approach to our truth claims. It was a reliance on what we more often would call \"non-fiction\". We used records of history to begin to piece together clues about what might be causing these diseases, because our holy scriptures about evil posesssions just weren't cutting it.\n\nIn the end, Salk solved the problem with almost no regard for great myth or fairy tale. He, and many others, worked to solve the problem by being very careful and practical about their approach regardless of what their hopes and dreams told them about how David could slay Goliath. That kind of grandiose perspective clearly isn't necessary to produce powerful solutions to our problems, and I would argue it might actually hinder us more than it helps. Because it can cause us to pursue something as a matter of faith, regardless of how dismal our current approach might be. There is a great line from an old entertainer named W.C.

I said when it comes to actually solving problems in our lives, this quote does not represent what really gets us results. Believing in some fantastical David vs. Goliath metaphor for our struggles has led us into centuries of doing things that were very counter-productive. In many ways, the entire Jewish and Christian religions are this kind of story about God's one chosen people finally throwing off the much more powerful invading oppressors who have controlled their holy lands for generations. What has that got us? Well, Judeo-Christian thought has played a significant role in the foundation of our modern secular, liberal, free market democracies, but it has also, unquestionably, given us religious violence and hatred that seems to have almost no end. And why does this hatred burn so brightly for so long? It is because it is fueled with the kind of passion that Gaiman and Chesterton are referring to. It is not a mere coincidence that Chesterton is not just a famous writer, but also a famous *Christian* thinker. What we are talking about in these quotes is faith, specifically, the faith to believe that we can overcome incredible odds with willpower and faith alone.\n\nAnd this is exactly why I don't like the quote as a broad inspiration. Often, this kind of devoted faith can have us killing each other over holy lands well into the modern era. It can convince some Palestinians to fire their weapons from over the shoulders of their own children to deter the Israelis from firing back. This is the full picture of what this kind of faith gets us, and it is often not very pretty. And for most of human history, we really had nothing else that we could really rely on. These stories were the only thing that kept us going, but the real irony is that, in many ways, it was these stories that were also holding us back the whole time. We were locked into these ancient desires and traditions, because we believed in them, not because they had been proven to be the most effective. When ancient parents killed one of their own children and buried the body under a post hole for a new building, they were not the evil, horrifying people they seem by modern standards. They had faith in what it took to overcome incredible odds. And humanity kept that kind of faith often on pain of death for thousands of years. \n\nBut the real tragedy we can see from our current time is that we've had the intelligence to solve these problems literally for millenia. If the ancient kings of the world could have known that by setting their people free to pursue whatever they wanted, they could unleash wealth and prosperity like nothing in comparison to what they were getting with force, then they would have seen how foolish it was. But they had traditions that common people had no idea of how to organize themselves, so they needed to have guilds, and sons needed to do as their fathers had done, so that society wouldn't fall into chaos. And they were fighting over the peak of a lifestyle that even many poor people today would find almost unbearable. What was stopping us from developing the Salk vaccine centuries before Salk was ever born was our faith in these traditions. Now, it is also no doubt possible that, at some of our darkest times, when there was no chance for anything else, we actually needed some kind of myth to make it through that night.

Stories that were told by black Americans during some rather difficult times. Brother Rabbit wasn't powerful, but he was clever and used his wits to escape from and trick those more powerful than him, like Brother Fox. At a time when people needed perseverance to survive and courage to try and make things better, they told each other stories. \n\nObviously the story is only a small part.

It hints at an essential truth whilst being so vague that it falls apart under any sort of scrutiny.\n\nI'm all for not overanalysing aphorisms and just extracting some warm, cosy wisdom from them - but I think this borders on the juvenile. The cliches of unsatisfied married family couples are useful for helping people realise there are many ways to live and no 'right' way - I dig that, I think most of us agree with that. But it's too easy to take that too far, and I think this quote speaks to that rather snarky voice that seeks to justify its own misery or lack of success by demeaning the decisions of others.\n\nI know people who are happily married and sleeping in luxury, but also have interesting lives. And some who have boring lives, but are happy with them. And a few who probably aren't. Conversely, I can think of some people I know who are living 'on futons', as it were, who are very happy or at least content - and many who are deeply unhappy with it. And not everyone sleeping on a futon is 'chasing their dreams' - most of them probably have more complex stories than that. The 'troubled artist' is a seductive cliche.\n\nAlso, as others have mentioned, 'there's no risk when you go after a dream' is really a silly thing to say.

We have more than enough resources to have people pursue their dreams. In fact, it'd probably be more beneficial to society to have people do that. The problem is that the cubicle gets money quicker and more directly to the people who have and control power. It's an inefficient and evil way of keeping our economy running. But since this is the world that we live in, we justify it through economic jargon and pretend to know how it all works out for the best.\n\nThe price we have to pay back to society isn't 40 hours a week. It's what we've been convinced is the price for our existence because companies want to mine people as a resource. The fact that we can't pursue our dreams in a time of plenty is a warning sign.

It was always in the back of my mind since they were both risky ventures. Being a writer only pays off for a very small minority of people and there is a reason most big movies are directed by the same 25 directors.

Hope this helps.... \n\nIn order to understand why some people are so opposed to modern marketing practices it is important to understand the history of marketing and in particular the amazing gains in Marketing Psychology that have been made in the last 50 years. \n\n\nCompanies are no longer simply running ads that advertise their product. Instead they are focused on creating emotional connections that humanize and create a relationship between the purchaser and the product. Essentially modern marketing tactics , if used immorally, can be similar to an abusive relationship. It creates doubts and fears to sell solutions in some circumstances, or otherwise creates feelings of loss or need to sell others. It isn't actually concerned with your actual well being but selling a product that fills an existential need created by playing on your desire for stability, acceptance, and success. This is exactly the same dynamic that abusive partners employ to create doubt fear and anxiety and maintain relationships that work to their benefit. \n\n\nI encourage you to go back and watch famous commercials from the 50's and 60's and compare them against the adds run in the superbowl the other night. Make careful note of how often the actual product is shown, how much it is talked about. Also look and notice how the emotional context of the language has changed dramatically over the years. \n\n\nMany people in the industry are very concerned with the direction of modern marketing, stealth marketing tactics, social media coersion, and other tactics that really stretch the bounds of advertising into manipulative spaces where the emotional connections formed to products and services may actual hinder and color our ability to relate to each other in fundamental ways. We continue to head down a course where people are able to form longer lasting and stronger bonds to their consumer choices and maintain them for more of their lives than they are able to with the actual people in their lives. \n\n\nMarketing psychology is the most honest science there is in my humble opinion. It doesn't bother with right or wrong it just wants to know the symbolism and tactics that can be scientifically replicated to maximize profits. It's a trillion dollar industry because it works. You are not as in control of what you buy and consume as you may at first assume if you do not give at least a little now to the wizards of marketing. \n\n\nSo yeah.

Do you think that is a good summary of the advertising market?  Do you really think that all people that work in advertising (your profession) honestly \"wants noone to ever be happy\"?  Or is this just hyperbole?  How would the economy look if all advertising went away?\n  \nAgain going back to my post and my original question: \n\n\"Can someone provide an example of a legal industry, that legitimately employs lots of people that doesn't directly or indirectly depend on advertising to exist?\".  Is there such an example?\n\nNow don't get me wrong.  I F*ing hate intrusive ads.  I lothe pop ups.  I hate being forced to watch a 30 second ad before a 10 seconds YouTube clip...  I resent that basically 1/3 of all television broadcast time is devoted to advertisements (sometimes more).  Thankfully over the last 10 years or so things like AdBlockers and Cord Cutting have evolved.\n\nSo before we get tangential and delve into the psychology and evolution of the modern advertising industry can answer answer my question from my original post?\n\nHopefully that helps put my original post into more context.\n\nRegarding your reply, I kind of feel like you are being a bit nostalgic in your assessment of  1950's - 1960's advertising.  Advertisement is just a passive form of sales.  In order to sell something you must fulfill or create a desire from the consumer.  This can be accomplished in a combination of ways such as (but not limited to) price, convenience, prestige, sex appeal, \"better product\"...etc\n\nSo per your request here are a few ads from the 1950-60's period and we can see how these ads hit the sales points:\n\n[Sugar Smacks - just watch the first 1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFbCGT_AWBI)  This ad is directed at children.  SUPERMAN is pitching it - celebrity endorsement and kids love Superman.. and Superman loves Sugar Smacks.  Kids beg their parents for product and sales increase...just like today.\n\n[Alka Seltzer](https://youtu.be/PFbCGT_AWBI?t=1m) - again just watch the 60 second commercial.  Now we have a Candian Mounty (a trusted, iconic figure..especially during that era).  He is fatigued and has indigestion and it's inhibiting his ability to do his job.  This ad is targeting \"pain points\" with their demographic and endorsing the product (creating confirmation bias) by using that specific character.  This technique is still in practice today.\n\n[Listerine](https://youtu.be/_39gkDAbMaI?t=53s) - Here we see an affluent, attractive man and woman on the tennis court (a \"rich person's\" sport).  This ad is focused on personal sex appeal - specifically targeting women.  Jane has bad breath so she is socially ostracized - \"no man lingers long around Jane because her breath smells like a f*ing toilet\".  Anyone watching this has no desire to be in Jane's predicament - so message here is \"we can fix you\" - don't you want wealthy men to like you?\nAgain this is not a long forgotten sales technique - we do the same thing today.\n\nI have already gone on way too long.. basically I don't believe that there has been some revolutionary paradigm shift of the underlying psychological \"tricks\" advertisers use today than what they used to do..  the only things that has changed is the frequency and invasiveness of the ads - the messages and \"tricks\" are the same.  Now they are getting intolerable and are a result people are revolting via Ad Blockers and Cutting the Cord. \n\n", "id": "czsnd93"}, {"comment": "Very solid response. Thanks for getting me thinking. \n\nI do agree with the quote but I feel like any good marketing it is an excision of a larger whole positioned specifically to illustrate the feelings of OP more than the position of the original author. \n\n\nI would also use this as an example of exactly how our cognitive biases can make ads very very powerful. Since I work in the field I can step back a little and see how two different peopl can read this quote and some are horrified by the cynicism of it and others say that it is a little dreary but mostly accurate and not really something to get emotional over. \n\n\nThere are some good examples of this in popular culture. It is amazing how dramatically different people interpret certain things. In my own life I have seen people watch Michael Douglas's greed speech in \"Wall St\" and been inspired by it when the intent of the person who wrote the speech was to horrify people with a cold justification for greedy overreach. The same experience can be had talking to people about Jack Nicholson's speech at the end of \"A Few Good Men\". \n\nThis flexibility that our cognitive biases provide works as a kind of shield for us. It is a shield that has functioned well for a long period of time but (Now to actually address the best parts of your pitch) now that marketing campaigns are managed at several different levels we can create synergies inside of which to think. \n\n\nWhereas in the past we could have the alka seltzer ad that you called out so well. It's brand strength and it's use are clear. The circumstances common and the need obvious. That is a strong message. \n\nThe difference nowadays is we would focus on creating a social situation with a dynamic between people to illustrate the possible embarrassing aspects of this issue and to establish a secondary archetype as the solution. It is essential this archetype is a person and not the actual product. Hence why so many remedy ads rely on a dialogue between two or more poeple to properly position the prouduct. \n\nHere is where things get interesting. Back in the early days we had to scour popular culture, news and media trends to identify key cultural touchstones with which to coach our language to create these powerful messages in the heads of our consumers. With a smaller amount of media (Just the networks and Radio) back in the day this was easier. As we transitioned into a cable and internet age it became much more difficult to find those cultural archetypes to resonate with our consumers. This led to adoption of using resources in the form of money, people, media ownership, and synergistic relationships between compatible brands to increase market share. We basically stopped trying to find desire or need and instead to create need.\n\n\nA fun example of this is the proliferation of Apple devices that showed up in a wide array of network programming and movies throughout the 90's and 2000's. Apple computers were often used by the \"good guys\" in many shows. This is something that consumers do not even know that they are registering but is extremely powerful. We are predisposed to replicate the purchases and overall behaviors of people we respect or like. It is a shortcoming of our brains that we can form this strong emotional connection with fictional characters and our brains registers their choices as consistent with the recommendation of a trusted family member. Taking this logic one step more since there is often very little dissonance around your favorite fictional characters but often are familial relationships are significantly more complex, it is entirely possible that you are actually more likely to be influenced by the opinions and brands that are favored by your favorite fictional characters. \n\n\nAnother even more famous apple campaign is the \"Think Different\" campaign. An actual empirical review of the products available on the market shows the following... The Pc Market is devirse with a plurality of devices and options with many open source options and overall lower cost of ownership. The mac side of the aisle you have codified systems with proprietary technologies and if it's not officially out of apple it's not allowed on the platform. We have a marketing message of \"Think different\"  yet the product structure and implementation is restrictive. \n\n\nNowadays it is not uncommon for marketing to be implemented at every layer of our social interactions up to and including... \n\n\nCelebrity endorsements and product placements \nSocial Networking being infiltrated by brand managers and street teams promoting products or perspectives while pretending to be unaffiliated. \nViral street teams that go to high visibility and trendy areas to influence taste makers and trendsetters to have cascading effects in their marketing. \n\n\nDue to a lot of different tensions it appears we are at the edge of a weird time ahead of us where fictional voices that are paid to forward a product or initiative are weighted more than the thoughts and opinions of experts, and objective voices. \n\n\nWell that was a good ramble. There might be one or two cogent thoughts in there. \n\nTL:DR Modern marketing tactics are no more right than wrong. They are like all things, a tool in the makers hand. In my 40 years I have often seen that the man with the most to gain should always be watched and my personal concern is that we do no oversight with how companies, or political enterprises, use these powerful tools.

The Listerine ad I posted is EXACTLY this format.  Again, nothing revolutionary has happened.  It's all the same proven sales tactics, regurgitated and repackaged - it's just served to us at a much higher frequency and it's more intrusive. \n\n>A fun example of this is the proliferation of Apple devices that showed up in a wide array of network programming and movies throughout the 90's and 2000's.\n\nApple did not break any new ground by doing product placement in film or TV.  Product placement in film and TV is nothing new - again, nothing revolutionary about this at all.\n\nThe first recognized product placements was in 1919 Roscoe Arbuckle comedy The Garage, in which a Red Crown Gasoline logo was displayed on screen.  That was 97 years ago!\n\nMore modern examples but still 30+ years old are:\n\n* 1977 Close Encounters of the Third Kind - McDonald's and Coke are well established.\n\n* 1982 - ET - Reese's Pieces (the entire film revolved around this product placement!)\n\n* 1986 - Top Gun - Ray Bands\n\n* 1983 - Risky Business - Ray Bands again\n\nAgain. Nothing new here.  Same stuff repacked.\n\n>Celebrity endorsements and product placements Social Networking being infiltrated by brand managers.\n\nCelebrity endorsement isn't new - see Sugar Smack 1950's commercial with Superman.  The only thing \"new\" was the evolution of Social Networks and the Internet.  Again, the message is the same it's just being fed through a new format.\n\n>Viral street teams \n\nNow this is a great example of something \"new\" in advertising.  Good call on this one!\n\nAnyway, I go back to my original post, advertising is a necessary evil and our current system would break down without it.

Take any popular items or services that have ever existed. Take a smartphone. What would have happened without public ads? The companies would have contacted store chains, some would have taken the product into their catalogue and displayed it on shelves. Some people would've bought it. Through word of mouth, smart phones - if useful, of quality and offered at acceptable price - would have become well-known. This would happen with essentially everything. What would change without advertisements is that products would need to actually be better, i.e. worth talking about, would have to last in order for a customer to feel satisfied or \"close\" to the product. Uber could have started with a few taxi drivers talking with the company and the company having to make a good impression.

You are employed by a HVAC construction company.  \n\nWho and how are your customers paying for this construction?  Do they advertise in any capacity?\nHow do they acquire their clients?  Where does the money come from?  Sales and marketing - I would stake my life on it.  \n\nIf your clients were not selling something - your company would not exist and you in turn would not be employed.  So again, let's go with \"your company doesn't advertise to anyone\".. but it indirectly depends on other companies to advertise.  Now you can come back with \"nope we just did a project with XYZ company (say you installed an HVAC system for another non-advertising HVAC company for some reason) - well they had to pay you with something.. where and who do they get their money from.\n\nMy point is the economy and employment rates cannot exist in their current form without someone, somewhere actively (and successfully) advertising their product.\n\nFrom your post:\n>the company attends a trade show each year but it's more of an excuse to get wasted, and we don't do any promoting of ourselves either.\n\nWhile I do believe this is your experience - no company is going to pay 10's of thousands of dollars to fly their employees, accommodate them, feed them, pay for bar tabs and a booth at a trade show and not at least make an attempt to recoup those expenses.  It may not appear to be \"advertising\" to you but a lot of things go into a trade show.  \n\n* Do you have a booth? If so that = Market awareness and brand recognition \n\n* Do you have any literature about your company and what you do? = Sales/Marketing/Advertising \n\n* Do you walk the show to meet new contacts? = Sales relationships turn into future contract\n\n* Has your company ever hosted a dinner or happy hour?  Who is on the invite list?  Prospective clients most likely.  = Sales and marketing.\n\nSo while you may not feel like your company advertises I think, in some capacity they do... but again, without you providing me your company name or it's closest competitor I can't \"prove it\" - but with that said, the example you gave of \"construction\" does not meet the criteria of my question:\n\n>directly or indirectly depend on advertising to exist.\n\nDoes that make sense?", "id": "czsq6kr"}, {"comment": "Yeah I get what you're saying.

Happy people still need paper towels and haircuts and apples.

Heck, it certainly provides jobs and gets people products they like.\n\nBut at root, advertising and marketing creates in people a \"lack\". \n\nSometimes it's picturing an idealized version of a life \u2013 something no body can live up to. They look around their life and realize they're not as fit, nor as attractive, nor as rich, nor have as nice a car, or don't have as many friends, or not enough adventures, etc. You, as the consumer don't measure up.

I drive an older car but recently got into someones new luxury SUV. Nice car, but mostly features that have nothing involved with getting me from point A to point B. Maybe having an old flip-phone should be just fine for most people?\n\nIf you're in advertising you must be familiar with the research that generally shows marketing/advertising can literally change people's brains. [Coca-cola is a good example of that one](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/26/magazine/there-s-a-sucker-born-in-every-medial-prefrontal-cortex.html?pagewanted=all). \n\nOn another level, a few states don't have billboards. I feel so much more relaxed when driving in states without the constant shouting of slogans, witticisms, and ad council messages. I've not seen studies, but it would be fascinating to see the cortisol levels of drivers around billboards compared to those without.\n\nSo, what about positive commercials? Things with cute puppies and hopeful messages? Maybe something like Bernie Sander's recent [America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug) commercial spot? It's got to be one of the most positive political ads in recent memory. It made me feel warm fuzzies and remember the awesome parts of this country and people. \"A future you can believe in\". But also indicates a present that doesn't measure up. \n\nAds can be fun little stories, highly creative, engaging, and amazing. They can be delivered in a way that comes off as a light FYI, or advice from a good friend. But ultimately ads make you want SOMETHING. Wanting something so much that you part with money to get it. This isn't a positive for the consumer, and aims to make them feel at least a little unhappy until they buy the advertised product/service.\n\nBetter thinkers than I can get deeper into a philosophical and ethical critique of materialism, but one of the most interesting books I've read in years was *Infinite Jest* - a book written by a person trying to figure out why the richest country in the world, with all of their stuff that should be happiness inducing, was a country full of unhappy people.

I'm just sharing some soft conclusions I've come to on this, and which I'm open to adjusting.\n\nOn the one hand, people do talk meaningfully about people acting 'evil' or doing 'evil' things because they're 'evil'. I think it's probably always better to label actions rather than labelling people (so that future actions aren't being assumed).\n\nOn the other hand, I don't personally literally believe in 'good' and 'evil'. I'm an athiest, and simply recognize that people use the words and they mean something by that. And this is the best I've been able to come up with for what the word 'evil' means when it's used... just people causing harm against others which those with empathy find utterly incomprehensible and terrible.\n\nI think probably the things people call 'evil' are often done by people who are sadistic and psychopathic. There are other ways it can happen, though, like actively dehumanizing a particular group and therefore not feeling empathy for them because they're not human and also it's no big deal to hurt them because they're not human. For example, Donald Trump appears not to have empathy outside his family unit, and so doesn't mind hurting people for his own selfish needs. And he dehumanizes women to some extent so that he doesn't appear to mind abusing them sexually. And so he's somewhere on that spectrum, though probably best just described as a narcissist who acts like a selfish asshole.\n\nBut if 'evil' is generally done by those who are sadistic and psychopathic, and/or to a group which has been actively dehumanized (perhaps by psychopathic leaders), then 'evil' is just a social shorthand for people doing things that we could never imagine doing ourselves because of empathy and not wanting to hurt others. People who don't have those mental abnormalities (ab-normal literally just meaning extremely not-average) don't generally do things that people would describe as being 'evil'. So generally only individuals with those mental health conditions do things which are considered 'evil' on their own, unless a social group dehumanizes another social group.\n\nAlthough the Milgram Experiment and Stanford Prison Experiment provide other ways that can happen (like submission to authority).\n\nIs your interest in this that you lack the ability to feel empathy for others?", "id": "d8qtatp"}, {"comment": ">Is your interest in this that you lack the ability to feel empathy for others?\n\nNope, I just think you don't have to have a mental illness to dehumanize people and implying that vast swathes of people with mental illness are dangerous can increase mistreatment of those who simply have a hard time connecting with those around them.\n\nI don't think \"evil\" as you define it is caused by psychopathy in a majority of cases, but by a different definition of \"personhood.\" ", "id": "d8qu08v"}]]], "56frgp": ["\"my pain may be the reason for somebody's laugh.but my laugh must never be the reason for somebody's pain \" -charlie chaplin [800 \u00d7 565]", "2016-10-08 10:01:00", 4079, "http://i.imgur.com/TDNu7Be.jpg", [[88, "Jesus, these comments are already abysmal."], [24, "This is like the antithesis of the reddit creed.

I feel like you put some emotion into your interpretation where as I took this in a more literal sense. Not bashing or judging, just thought it was interesting.\n\nI took this as everything costs your time. It has nothing to do with being rewarded to me.

If you want to spend days on your couch watching TV then that is fine, but just realize you are paying for that in the form of a limited resource which is time in your life.\n\nFor me this quote really conceptualizes a thought process I often use for avoiding frivolous purchases. If I think about the amount of time I spent to earn the money to buy something then it can often dissuade me from buying it, because that isn't money that I am spending on that item. It is time I spent earning the ability to buy that item and suddenly it doesn't seem worth it.\n\n", "id": "d3eyt3x"}, {"comment": "I get the whole \"happiness is a journey, not a destination thing\" but when it comes down to it many jobs that people are stuck with make their lives hell. Regardless of their motivation or mindset. ", "id": "d3em54x"}, {"comment": "To put the quote in context, and the important point in front, Thoreau says in his book *Walden* (same book as the quote), \"As I preferred some things to others, and especially valued my freedom, as I could fare hard and yet succeed well, I did not wish to spend my time in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture, or delicate cookery, or a house in the Grecian or the Gothic style just yet. If there are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things, and who know how to use them when acquired, I relinquish to them the pursuit. Some are \"industrious,\" and appear to love labor for its own sake, or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief; to such I have at present nothing to say. Those who would not know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to work twice as hard as they do\u2014work till they pay for themselves, and get their free papers.\"\n\nHe says, \"Because life goes into anything, think carefully what you do with it. Is what you want something you really need? If not, don't spend your life on it!\" \n\nHe continues, \"If it's no trouble to get it, whatever, I don't care. Not writing to you. But if you're those who labour and strive for this, and find it unappealing, think about what you're doing with your life!\"\n\nAnd again he continues, \"And if all you're going to do is waste time if you're not working, work twice as hard until you've earned your freedom from needing to work.\"\n\nAnd so we see the quote too often misread. \n\nIn his book, \"Walden and Civil Disobedience,\" Thoreau has a little section about houses; how houses have gotten fancier, but not easier or less costly to build; how although the quality of the buildings have imrproved, the cost/life that goes into a house (especially from money laboured for), has not. And thus, he says, \"society has not really progressed. Progression is only when we can get a higher quality of xyz while retaining/improving on the cost.\" \n\nThat's the immediate context of the quote. he's talking about life \n\nHe also shares this sentiment though; that he will not spend his life for something if it is only to earn wages. That is, after all, why he dropped his job and place in society and went to live in the woods by a pond for a few years; he so valued his mind that he left all other work behind. (And he managed to live self-sustained for that period of time, so he wasn't leeching off anyone.)\n\nRegardless, it's true that some people can find enrichment in their jobs. But that's not the point of the quote.\nThere are jobs out there that do not require much mental work at all. One example is, perhaps, long-haul truck driving. All you have to do is sit in a truck and drive straight roads (correct me if I'm wrong). It's true that your mind is free, but only so much. Only within the bounds of what can be accessed while driving. \n\nAnd unfortunately some jobs do require you to give up your consciousness; anything that requires you to plan ahead and think means you have to give something up. You can't exactly go around thinking of poems while in a meeting with clients, or figuring out someone's health problems. \n\nThere are also jobs that require you to actually use your mind; the health field, for example, is you selling your expertise/thinking to help someone. Some people can be happy with that, and others may not be. \n\nThe question isn't, \"Why are you spending your life to get money?\" it's \"Why do you spend your life on things that are so frivolous and of no use to you?\"", "id": "d3f1u0v"}, {"comment": "As I see it, the only two commodities worth anything are time and experience.

Right now it's the divorce and how my dad comes to me for dating advice. I realize I no longer have a family I simply have people related to me back home. (I'm at university) my dad isn't a leader he is simply a weird friend now. I don't look up to him. It also makes me really sad that this one chance of existence on this earth I don't get to have a family like everyone else. Christmas, thanksgiving, etc are all very awkward and consist of everyone pretending things aren't weird and awkward. I struggle with the idea that since I never had a serious girl friend up to this point that I will never get the experience of bringing her home to the family and all of us having dinner, laughing, and getting to know eachother. Instead I will have to bring her in to the awkward chaos that is going to two separate dinners and pretend like it's normal, while most likely when I go to her family it will be what I always wanted. \n\nThe sad thing is my dad isn't someone I can look up to. He just asks for dating advice as he does online dating and I have to give him advice and talk to girls and stuff. And you think that sounds like a cool father son relationship but it's not trust me. I'm type A and my father is very type B. Seeing him come to me for advice sucks. I want a father I can respect. Someone who still teaches me things or when I come home from college tells me cool stories from his child hood or someone who can teach me how to take care of car etc etc etc. but nope instead it's me (i have two sisters and they mostly took care of my mom) it's just me emotionally taking care of my dad since my mom left him. I literally have to be an emotional crutch for my dad. I have to talk to him. Hear all his dark thoughts, try to make him happy, then hear all his dating stories and try to help him with girls while the next day I'm going to my moms house and hearing all her dating stories. I wish all in the world I could just have a family that at least takes care of me because the world sure doesn't care about me but instead whether I'm at college or at home I'm taking care of somebody else and making sure they're okay. I no longer have a family at home I just have people related to me. Their awkward older friends to me now that help me financially on occasion. That's it. I no longer know what it's like to have parents who help guide me through life. It's just me. \n\nEven though I consider my self very independent and I'm doing well on my own at university I wish I could stop standing on my own and having someone just hug me and understand what I'm going through on the inside. I'm very type A (ENTJ Myers Briggs if you like that stuff) but I'm well aware of the need and importance of recognizing emotions. With that said nobody sees past my act. I'm very much of a believer in fake it till you make it I just want someone to call me out on my bullshit and enpathize with me. \n\nI can't seem to figure out what's going on with me and therapy doesn't really help because my issue comes from wanting deep connections with others but I can't seem to get it. I've tried so many different tactics when meeting people. The sad thing is if we're being honest if you were a fly on the wall you would think why am I complaining about my life. I'm doing well in school, I have a lot of \"friends\", I party every weekend, I'm on track to have a good job out of university, and I acknowledge all of that is good I really do and it makes me feel like such an under appreciative ass saying this but it's like it's not enough. I feel like I have only gotten where I am because of my type a personality. While it's good you'll realize if you look deeper none of my \"friends\" are deep and meaningful connections. Sure I hang out with a lot of people and usually have someone I can call at some point but it usually consists of us going to grab food because we're both hungry and it mutually serves our interests, were smoking pot, or were going to a party I invited them too. The problem with all of this is that none of it consists of people just wanting to hang out with me. Deep down I feel like I have nothing truly to offer people. I only feel that way because I look back at the evidence of my time at university and very rarely do people ever just call me up or want to hang out with me. I feel like I have nothing special. Even though you might think I have a lot of \"friends\" nobody would even know my parents were divorced if you asked them. Nobody knows anything about me. Not because I'm super closed off but because I'm not going to throw my problems to everyone unless people are wanting to hear them and help me but the sad thing is nobody wants to help me and so I'm left alone all the time to self sooth myself. I've gotten pretty good at it. In no way am I suicidal but I wish all in the world someone could just call me out on my bull shit and I could just cry and they would completely get it or even better have a group a friends who simply wanted to help me in my dark time.

That's a lot to go through - especially the stuff with your dad. It sounds like you're trying to balance to different -and apparently contradictory - desires/needs: to be in control, and to be connected. To be really, completely known on the level you're talking about requires a kind of vulnerability and release of control; it means asking for help. And vulnerability is scary and hard. But real connection doesn't arise from another's intuitive emotional sixth-sense that somehow picks all of the locks of our psychic barriers, but from us choosing to lower those barriers to that someone.

But conversations become so one sided, I learn so much about them and continue to ask questions and genuinely become interested in what their saying but the most I get is a \"what about you?\" \"Oh that's cool\" and it's frustrating. I consider myself I very logical person and I'm a compsci minor so the way I tackle problems is to break them down into parts and analyze them.

I'm young and adventurous I simply want someone at least I connect to on some level to date for awhile just to date. But I've never been in a serious relationship, the longest being about 3 months. I have no understanding of what it means to be in a long relationship. I have become so independently minded idk if I can be in one since they depend on a sort of co dependence. I just want a girl to be interested in me. I feel like all the girls I get \"close\" to are because I'm trying and acting on my best behavior to win them over and sure they like it and we kiss but it's never the feeling that the whole thing is 50/50. I have no idea what the feeling of being wanted is like. And I guess you can't really miss what you've never had. \n\nI just feel nothing on the inside and I know most people would say that's depression but it's weird because I'm still doing coding projects on the side, getting internships, doing well in school, getting into prestigious clubs, etc etc etc so i don't look depressed and I don't lack motivation but man just when it comes to my emotions I understand that emotional intelligence is valuable and I don't want to bottle them up but I also don't want to spew the contents of the bottle on just any one. I want people who want to help clean up the mess and pick me back up. But in my time on this planet nobody has looked my way and put a hand on my shoulder. So I sit here holding my bottle as it burns me every day. And every day I put I smile on my face and tackle the world. But the thing that really kills me every night before I go to bed is I think to myself how happy I am that I didn't die today because if I did nobody would know the true me and everyone would pretend to care and bullshit at my funeral and that would be that. All my true thoughts, desires, needs, and loves would be wasted and left to rot in my dry spongy mind In a cold dark grave as I cease to exist. \n\n\nI'm sorry for all the text and for any typos or poor sentence structure I typed this on my iPhone in my bed.

I think one of the most difficult things in life is finding people where you can be really open and honest and supportive with no real strings attached, you're just wide open and vulnerable. But the people you can do that with are so rare, it's definitely not everybody. And I look at the people who just throw their problems around openly, and I just ask myself \"don't they see how people are seeing them right now?\" Throwing your problems around for everybody to hear is not always brave, sometimes it's just careless. Sometimes it shows such a profound lack of empathy that your problems are the worst thing anybody could ever be going through, when I'm coming from the place of: maybe the person I'm talking to is going through more than I am. Or maybe I am going through more, but they're going through a lot and are not in a place mentally and emotionally where they can process my problems and have that conversation right now. Neither of us would be \"brave\" in that situation to force the other person to have a tough conversation about raw feelings and pain. In a way it's a form of cowardice to be so unable to carry your own problems without imposing them on others, to need that validation that your problems are real and important. It's why I avoid complaining, because I know how I feel when somebody complains to me about something petty when I am going through something real (real being my mom's deteriorating health, my fear that I can't hold a job because of my depression, that I don't fit anywhere in this world, that my dog is paralyzed, etc). I don't need to just have that stuff on the surface of every conversation. Sure I need somebody to share it with so I'm not alone with it, but again, there's a time and a place.

You're literally saying, \"My authentic feelings, thoughts and actions are less important than other people's, so I will suppress them and allow others to freely express themselves at my own expense.\" Do you understand how detrimental this is to yourself? It stems from low self esteem and lack of self worth.

You're not helping anyone because their going to be happy whether you do this or not, you're just hurting yourself by being a doormat.

I have a theory on this.  Most people stop developing or just vastly slow down.  They stop changing as much.  You'll find as you get older that a certain ideology or certain political stances are just stuck or ingrained in certain generations.  Like for example, my parents were raised by my grand parents who were born into the great depression, or right around 1925-1930.  So what's a really common trait of my parents generation?  Being cheap and not wasting anything.   Also this generation is vastly more nationalistic because of WW2.\n\nSome things like that just leave impressions.  But, my point is, most people slow down as they age.  They get into routines where they basically live the same life day in and day out for decades on end.  This isn't very conducive to change or personal growth.\n\nBUT..  loneliness is a big factor for most people.  As you get older/middle aged a lot more people start dying.  You find yourself going to funerals more often.  If you don't have kids and also ostracize yourself from the \"people with kids\" social group you start to dwindle down your social opportunities. \n\nNow, I will admit that your generation has it easier, and each successive one seems to, because marriage and kids are becoming less and less of an automatic life choice, which maeks it easier on you, but just consider, going with the social norm is a way to ensure you are never lonely.  It's a very basic human instinct.  Resisting it is not as easy as you think it is.  This is why many young people are super anti-kids until they ding 30 and their biological clock starts ticking and they say to themselves... \"do i want someone to visit me in a nursing home one day?\"\n\nYou know how when you were 20, you looked back at 15 and were like \" i didn't know jack shit then\"  well it should always be that way.  And the interval of time on \"i didn't know jack shit then\" SHOULD get smaller as you get older.   If it's not, or if you feel like you had things figured out 5 years ago, then I'd take that as a sign that you stopped changing/growing/etc...\n\nTLDR:  Most people are cowards when it comes to these things and they love company.", "id": "d5lrecf"}, {"comment": "Sounds pretty well thought out to this 31 year old.

The young \"dream\" of what they will do, which is great, and a necessary part of life. But at around age 30, you begin to realize, \"I could die without leaving anything good behind\", and rather than simply \"dreaming\", you begin to do things. You begin to create the ideas in your head and bring them out into the world. \n\nBy age 60, much of your physical strength and vitality is on the decline, which means you can't perform at the same mental level you were capable of at younger ages. Old people can have sharp minds, but on average they were capable of more industry during their younger years.\n\nSo to 20 year old you... keep dreaming, but as soon as you're capable - begin creating your dreams. Learn to apply your ideas and bring them out into the real world rather than having them simply exist in your mind.

A product with zero tobacco in it now needs to undergo millions in testing in order to come to market. Even the ones that have been on the market for the last 9 years. They're retroactively enforcing regulation for a product that they just decided to call tobacco because it competes with actual tobacco (all the while having no actual tobacco in it). Cigarettes have *never* had to undergo those tests before coming to market if they were introduced before February 2007. Products that we know cause millions of deaths each year worldwide are not being tested to prove that they \"benefit public health,\" but products that have been shown in independent testing to be safer than smoking (ah, except the ones that benefit the pharmaceutical industry of course) are being forced out of the market by deceptive regulation.

Assuming 1M abortions per year, we look at the stats for alcohol-related deaths, and we find out this:\n\n88,000 deaths are annually attributed to excessive alcohol use (this includes the alcohol-related highway crashes accounting for 13,365 deaths in 2010)\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/data-stats.htm\n\nTherefore, your statement:\n\n> it's objectively clear that alcohol has caused far more death and abuse than abortion, violent video games, or even guns.\n\nIs unequivocally false, in that the exact inverse is true taken the case of abortion and (violent video games is difficult to objectively measure): it is objectively clear that alcohol has caused far fewer cases of death (abuse is also hard to objectively quantify) than abortion has.\n\nHowever, you are 100% correct regarding guns.

Of course there'll be many people on either side who think the other are idiots, but is it not fair to have a well-reasoned critique on historical figures and their actions?\n\nAh see, well that's precisely my point. Anyone who criticises Churchill on the basis of the Bengal 1943 famine evidently knows little about both. Firstly, because any honest attempt at criticising the character of Churchill would have no shortage of material. This is a man who was largely sympathetic to fascism until as late as 1937, who supported eugenics etc etc. There have been so many criticisms of Churchill, it's frankly bizarre to focus on the Bengal Famine. Not to mention suspicious that those who do so seem wholly ignorant of the myriad of other criticisms that have been levied at him over the years.\n\nTo suggest Churchill was responsible for the famine is quite frankly ridiculous. Before even questioning the extent to which a single individual can have that kind of impact on such a complex event (even as PM), the only person to ever claim this was the case was a woman named Madhusree Mukerjee, who claimed it in a book in 2010 called 'Churchills secret war'. Mukerjee is *not* a historian. Not even close - her only qualifications are a bachelor's in physics and a career as a science journalist. Her claims that Churchill is responsible for the famine are based on the idea that he blocked food aid to india during the famine years. However, anyone who knows anything about famine or economics knows that the Bengal famine of 1943 had nothing to do with food shortages. This was established by the Nobel Prize winning Bengali Economist Armartya Sen in his 1982 book *Poverty and Famine*. Mukerjee's arguments, despite their questionable historical merit, have gained traction on social media and on the internet thanks to the sensationalism of her claims.\n\nMy point is that if anyone criticising Churchill were *actually* interested in having a debate about how we view historical figures, they would not be basing it on the Bengal famine. If you make that argument, it immediately highlights to me that you've done no research and learned everything you know about the subject from some facebook page or blog. This, combined with the condescending way people present their argument, suggests to me that their criticism of Churchill has more to do with making themselves feel superior and enlightened - dare i say 'euphoric' - than it does with an actual interest in history.\n", "id": "d9oqvq1"}, {"comment": "I don't know what country you're from, UK, USA, European continent...but in the case of WWII, millions of men died so that we can even have this conversation; so that we can enjoy a modicum of civilized society; so that we can have liberties to cherish. \n\nAnd it was men like Churchill, FDR, Patton, etc, who led those men.

This would have kept nearly 400,000 people alive for a full year. Mr Churchill turned down fervent pleas to export food to India citing a shortage of ships - this when shiploads of Australian wheat, for example, would pass by India to be stored for future consumption in Europe. As imports dropped, prices shot up and hoarders made a killing. Mr Churchill also pushed a scorched earth policy - which went by the sinister name of Denial Policy - in coastal Bengal where the colonisers feared the Japanese would land.

The first shipments of barley and wheat reached those in need only in November, by which time tens of thousands had already perished.

Context matters too: there's a difference between saying the same thing with men/women and women/men, and that difference is centuries of subjugation and institutionalised sexism. Similarly the difference between men/women and Aryan/Jewish is millions of dead Jewish people.\n\nAlso you should bare in mind that often people on the internet say things like \"[my demographic] is the best\" in order to vent and feel better about themselves, because they experience real pressures and stigma in other parts of their lives.\n\n> The hypocrisy is in celebrating difference by being the same, as in: 'People of colour' (A blanket term for anyone not white, which is apparently not racist while grouping together native americans, indians, burmese, chinese, japanese into the same cultural group and assuming they're all the same, go figure) are better than 'white people' (grouping together the french, americans, british, canadians etc etc)\n\nNobody says that PoC are better than white people and mean it. The reason the term \"People of Colour\" exists is because people needed a term to describe anyone who didn't experience institutionalised privilege because of their skin colour, ie: all non white people. \n\nAlso how is grouping several different groups under a single term equal to assuming they're all the same? The word LGBT doesn't imply that everybody (whether they're lesbian or bi or trans) in queer communities goes through the same shit and is basically the same. Saying someone is \"Caucasian\" doesn't imply that that person shares their nationality with every other white person does it?

The solution is the internalize these externalities. In basic, you would need to quantify the real economic impacts of various pollution and activity, and make that cost part of the initial transaction. This currently gets pushed by government in the form of market based solutions. But it needs to be fundamental to economics, as it should be. It's entirely irrational to ignore the real economics costs of environmental damage.\n\nAs for finite resources, that's a bit more difficult to answer, and would need a far more fundamental approach. We do have the market forces of return on investment, but that tends to kick in when the problem has already started, rather than prevent it. But solving negative externalities first would be a big part of the problem gone. \n\nThe other more high level problem is that money has become to much of an ideology, rather than being a tool for managing resources. But I suspect that would go away if the other two problems were solved.\n\nIn basic, our economy needs to be more attached to reality.

"], [15, "Man, I can relate to this so well.  I'm at the very beginning steps of trying to build a reputation for myself in the art community.  As I eventually would like to be able to support myself with artwork.  No plans for anything extravagant, just want to pay the bills with it.  I'd like to think that having three bachelors degrees in various fine-art related subjects shows that I'm not a slacker, and that I'm both talented enough and capable enough to use my art to achieve something.  Even if that's just being able to pay my bills with it.\n\nThe issue is that I have a full time job now.  And I love it.  Been with the company for almost three years, wonderful benefits, love the people I work with.  But it's like 50-60 hours of my week most of the time, accounting for commute and everything.  And the job itself is really fun, but I've found that I think it's fun because it uses the same...energy? that I use when I'm being creative.  But I don't get the same reward/satisfaction mentally from working as I do from finishing a piece.  So when I get home each night, or on a rare day off, I'm just mentally exhausted, and given that I average 6-8 miles of movement every day also pretty tired physically.  So there's so much desire to work on something productive.  To draw or paint or render something.  I want to do it so badly.  But when the time comes, I just feel like my brain is recharging from work and I have zero motivation or inspiration to complete anything useful.  So I do spend the sparse free time I have getting high and watching Netflix or playing video games.  It's frustrating.  Because ostensibly the answer is \"Just stop doing what you're doing and do the other thing\" but it isn't that simple.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's because I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depressive disorders so my wiring just isn't up to spec or something.  But even with medications, I haven't noticed much of a difference in how exhausted I am after work, or how much spare creative energy I have.\n\nAnd I would love to even just take fewer hours at work and have the spare time to work on personal stuff.  But I can barely make ends meet as is, so making less money and losing part of my benefits isn't an option, at least not until I'm making enough money from art to supplement the lost hours.  But you have to build that kind of clout.  And since for much of the past three years I've been producing a whopping 0 pieces a month, I'm obviously not going anywhere with that just yet.\n\nSo I feel like it's a weird catch-22.  Like I can either lose the money for a while and not be able to pay my bills until I start making more money on my own.  Or I can give up on the dream that I've had since I was 8 and take a more lucrative, but entirely inflexible, position at my current employer.\n\nI don't know.

I'm a high-functioning addict -- I get my work done, I'm a good employee, I stoke my passions and put in work toward my goals -- and it's a constant battle that I can justify as long as I meet certain benchmarks (being a good, productive member of the human species).\n\nFor instance, let's say in a day, I need to get 6 hours of work done, and run two short errands. There's two extremes on the spectrum of getting those things done modulo my vices: \n\n- (one end) run the errands and work those 6 hours with maybe an hour break in the middle during the working hours of the day and save my vices for the night as a reward,\n\n- (the other end) run an errand, smoke, work a bit, have an afternoon beer, watch some youtube videos, do the rest of the work, read reddit for a while and run the last errand. \n\nI'm still getting the work done in each case, but the second one feels lazier and less productive.\n\nI guess it just comes down to self-control. In the second case I'm implicitly accepting that I don't have control over when and how I indulge my vices. In the first, I'm in full control (if that's the best way I think I could allocate my time and energy). \n\nIt's just hard to muster the motivation to prove to myself I have control.

These super ambitious types are nothing but trouble. ", "id": "d6qqty3"}], [{"comment": "Man, I can relate to this so well.  I'm at the very beginning steps of trying to build a reputation for myself in the art community.  As I eventually would like to be able to support myself with artwork.  No plans for anything extravagant, just want to pay the bills with it.  I'd like to think that having three bachelors degrees in various fine-art related subjects shows that I'm not a slacker, and that I'm both talented enough and capable enough to use my art to achieve something.  Even if that's just being able to pay my bills with it.\n\nThe issue is that I have a full time job now.  And I love it.  Been with the company for almost three years, wonderful benefits, love the people I work with.  But it's like 50-60 hours of my week most of the time, accounting for commute and everything.  And the job itself is really fun, but I've found that I think it's fun because it uses the same...energy? that I use when I'm being creative.  But I don't get the same reward/satisfaction mentally from working as I do from finishing a piece.  So when I get home each night, or on a rare day off, I'm just mentally exhausted, and given that I average 6-8 miles of movement every day also pretty tired physically.  So there's so much desire to work on something productive.  To draw or paint or render something.  I want to do it so badly.  But when the time comes, I just feel like my brain is recharging from work and I have zero motivation or inspiration to complete anything useful.  So I do spend the sparse free time I have getting high and watching Netflix or playing video games.  It's frustrating.  Because ostensibly the answer is \"Just stop doing what you're doing and do the other thing\" but it isn't that simple.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's because I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depressive disorders so my wiring just isn't up to spec or something.  But even with medications, I haven't noticed much of a difference in how exhausted I am after work, or how much spare creative energy I have.\n\nAnd I would love to even just take fewer hours at work and have the spare time to work on personal stuff.  But I can barely make ends meet as is, so making less money and losing part of my benefits isn't an option, at least not until I'm making enough money from art to supplement the lost hours.  But you have to build that kind of clout.  And since for much of the past three years I've been producing a whopping 0 pieces a month, I'm obviously not going anywhere with that just yet.\n\nSo I feel like it's a weird catch-22.  Like I can either lose the money for a while and not be able to pay my bills until I start making more money on my own.  Or I can give up on the dream that I've had since I was 8 and take a more lucrative, but entirely inflexible, position at my current employer.\n\nI don't know.  I'm sure that a comment on a 5 hour old r/quotesporn isn't the best place for me to vent about this, but whatever, it just struck me.\n\nIf you've read this much, [here's a treat for you](https://www.instagram.com/snoopybabe/?hl=en)", "id": "d6qy6sz"}], [{"comment": "I think that guys live inside all of us.

I'm a high-functioning addict -- I get my work done, I'm a good employee, I stoke my passions and put in work toward my goals -- and it's a constant battle that I can justify as long as I meet certain benchmarks (being a good, productive member of the human species).\n\nFor instance, let's say in a day, I need to get 6 hours of work done, and run two short errands. There's two extremes on the spectrum of getting those things done modulo my vices: \n\n- (one end) run the errands and work those 6 hours with maybe an hour break in the middle during the working hours of the day and save my vices for the night as a reward,\n\n- (the other end) run an errand, smoke, work a bit, have an afternoon beer, watch some youtube videos, do the rest of the work, read reddit for a while and run the last errand. \n\nI'm still getting the work done in each case, but the second one feels lazier and less productive.\n\nI guess it just comes down to self-control. In the second case I'm implicitly accepting that I don't have control over when and how I indulge my vices. In the first, I'm in full control (if that's the best way I think I could allocate my time and energy). \n\nIt's just hard to muster the motivation to prove to myself I have control.

In essence, what he means is that you fight your battles with the foreknowledge of their outcome. IIRC, he was a widely-renowned swordsman in Feudal Japan who was frequently challenged to duels that he would win. *The Book of Five Rings* is full of his sayings/mentality/philosophy on the way to approach combat. It's like Sun Tzu's *Art of War* in that respect; it's about war, but it doesn't just have to be about war. Musashi preaches something of a transcendence above your conditions and opponents to have insight in what will happen before it happens. \n\nThere's an anecdote (likely more of a fable or tall tale) about him that when he was well on in years, a young swordsman approached him and challenged him. He then sat down in the middle of the road he was on and waited. When his opponent asked why he did this, Musashi responded (paraphrasing) \"I have seen all the ways you will fight me, and therefore all the outcomes are the same\". \n\nThe best way to illustrate this visually is to link to [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TzYrDKzA2U) from *The Last Samurai*.", "id": "d0scyix"}, {"comment": "You might be interested in *Hagakure*, too.

The easiest way I can think to explain it is that combat is about pure action, especially dueling in the samurai style, the fights would be very quick, and every micro-second is potentially important. In this scenario, any thoughts or doubts will impede the flow of your action. Gunk it up, add resistance. The point is more to not cling to life than to desire death, but it's still paradoxical, that the more you embrace death the less likely it will be that you encounter during the duel.

In both of those conflicts he had eye-opening encounters with Muslims. These incidents allowed his keen powers of observation and always-fluid pen to weigh in on the subject of Islamic society.\n\nWhile these words were written when he was only 25-years-old (in 1899), they serve as a prophetic warning to Western civilization today.\n\n\u201cHow dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism (Islam) lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy.\u201d\n\nChurchill apparently witnessed the same phenomenon in several places he visited. \u201cThe effects are apparent in many countries: improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.\u201d\n\nHe saw the temporal and the eternal tainted by their belief system. \u201cA degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe second-class status of women also grated at the young officer. \u201cThe fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cIndividual Moslems may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world.\u201d\n\nWell before the birth of modern Israel, its terror tactics and drive for world domination were felt. \u201cFar from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step, and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it (Islam) has vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.\u201d'"], [2, "He also said \n\"**democracy is the worst form of government** - except all the other forms tried from time to time\""], [2, "Churchill also said Islam in a man is like rabies in a dog, so he probably would've been for brexit, with immigration as a concern."], [2, "Churchill also said Islam in a man is like rabies in a dog, so he probably would've been for brexit, with immigration as a concern."], [4, "r/iamverysmart\n "], [2, "Churchill would have voted Brexit, lads.

In both of those conflicts he had eye-opening encounters with Muslims. These incidents allowed his keen powers of observation and always-fluid pen to weigh in on the subject of Islamic society.\n\nWhile these words were written when he was only 25-years-old (in 1899), they serve as a prophetic warning to Western civilization today.\n\n\u201cHow dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism (Islam) lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy.\u201d\n\nChurchill apparently witnessed the same phenomenon in several places he visited. \u201cThe effects are apparent in many countries: improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.\u201d\n\nHe saw the temporal and the eternal tainted by their belief system. \u201cA degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe second-class status of women also grated at the young officer. \u201cThe fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cIndividual Moslems may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world.\u201d\n\nWell before the birth of modern Israel, its terror tactics and drive for world domination were felt. \u201cFar from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step, and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it (Islam) has vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.\u201d'", "id": "d4n32ng"}], [{"comment": "He also said \n\"**democracy is the worst form of government** - except all the other forms tried from time to time\"", "id": "d4n3b7u"}], [{"comment": "Churchill also said Islam in a man is like rabies in a dog, so he probably would've been for brexit, with immigration as a concern.", "id": "d4n6957"}], [{"comment": "Churchill also said Islam in a man is like rabies in a dog, so he probably would've been for brexit, with immigration as a concern.", "id": "d4nelre"}], [{"comment": "r/iamverysmart\n ", "id": "d4mia3a"}], [{"comment": "Churchill would have voted Brexit, lads.

Miles Corak exem- plifies this for the difference observed in the United States for families with children under the age of 18.15 The top fifth of such families have about 12 times as much income as the bottom fifth. If the intergenerational persistence of income was equal to one, that income advantage would be transferred in whole to the next generation. That is, the children of the richest fifth would have 12 times as much income as the children of the poorest fifth. If the intergenerational persis- tence of income were equal to zero, none of that advantage would be present among the children of these groups. Corak reported that U.S. estimates of the elasticity vary in the range of 0.4\u20130.6, corresponding to an inherited income advantage of between 2.70 and 4.44 for the richest fifth compared to the poorest fifth. Elasticity at these levels means that the children whose parents were among the richest fifth (i.e., parents whose income was 12 times that of the poorest fifth) grow up to earn about 3 to 4 times as much as the children whose parents were among the poorest fifth. Thus, their income advantage was roughly half that of their parents.\nhttp://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc262g.pdf\n\n\n>\"Americans absolutely confirm they believe America is the land of opportunity and that people should have equal opportunity if they have the skills,\" said Diana Elliott, research officer for the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 Economic Mobility Project, in an interview. \"The data fly in the face of what Americans have believed and what they say they believe in our polling work.\"\n\n\n\nTLDR\nOf course you didn't, so the idea still hanging around that OPPORTUNITY is equal, when data just flies in the face of that is absurd.

His distrust of the people pushing the climate change theories and data is the same distrust that millions of other share with him due to people within the Global Warming/Climate Change movement coming out and admitting that data is being falsified and documents being forged, among other issues.\n\nThis has been happening since Al Gore started the push, and it's why no one really takes him seriously. Scientists, statisticians, data analysts and the like have all been, for years now, coming out of the woodworks and turning Whistleblower on false data and scams within the climate change 'movement'. \n\n> Secretary of Education\n\nShe's against Common Core and for school choice. \n\nThat's all I needed to hear to know that she's capable of obliterating the liberal establishment's  death grip on the school system that inhibits the progression and evolution of education. \n\nOne of Trump's major goals for his presidency is the revitalization of the inner cities, and one of the best ways to start doing that is education. Ending Common Core is one of the biggest steps to improving our public education system. \n\nAnyone who thinks ending Common Core and introducing school choice will turn public school into some religious nutbag factory is just actually retarded or they're intentionally fear-mongering. \n\nThere are already private schools that serve that purpose, public schools wouldn't bother.\n\nFreeing the public school system from the confines and shackles of Common Core is one of the single most important things that need to happen in America right now. \n\n> Treasury\n\nThis is the only one I personally have issues with, since the reported appointment has connections to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, I feel this has a lot more to do with Trump adopting a Lincoln-esque style of cabinet building, where he's including his harsh critics and people who have differing opinions so that his cabinet has a variety of opinions and isn't just an echo-chamber. \n\nI also think that appointing people close to \"the swamp\" is the best way to actually \"drain the swamp\". \n\nThis is why I like his Elain Chao appointment for Transportation so much. She's married to McConnell, so she has close ties to the very swamp that Trump is fighting. \n\nNot only does including these kinds of people insulate Trump from blockades from the establishment, letting him get real work and good done, it also helps him key in to the inner workings of the current establishment so that he knows how everything operates, who to drain out of the system, and how. \n\nSorry for the long post but I felt it was necessary to explain myself here. \n\n", "id": "daq28sr"}, {"comment": "Take a look at good Ole Texas where  creationism is constantly  trying to be snuck into public curriculum.

Everyone (blacks, whites, oriental, etc.) still do it but only in certain company. Growing up in former Yugoslavia where we had different ethnicities people would always make racist jokes to one another. The only time that stopped was the time leading up to the war. \n\nIt's important to consider how ideology has taken over our society.  For however free thinking we think we are, we are still very limited. We are not allowed to say that we are not allowed to say certain things. Get it?\n\nOne example I can give was in Yugo when the government would hold \"\"elections\"\" and the communists would \"\"win\"\" with a 90% vote.  Everyone knew that this was a sham but no one could openly speak out against it. \n\nSo a university news paper run by students were covering the election and they knew they couldn't just exactly say that the election was a sham so they came up with a genius idea. They ran a story that said: \"it looks like the communists might win the election\". The dean told the students to stop fucking with him and pull the story. They pulled the cheeky line of: \"what we didn't say anything wrong, what is wrong with our title?\". The dean couldn't tell them why they had to pull the story because then he would have to outright say it was a sham so he just repeated don't fuck with me and they had to pull the story. \n\nWhat is the point here?  It is this: that those students were not allowed to say that they are not allowed to say that the elections were a sham. This is the much more dangerous concept than just not being allowed to say that the elections are a shame. \n\nCompare this to now where we are not allowed to say that we are not allowed to be racist. The difference is that in former Yugoslavia the people knew this, in our society people are not aware how ideologically limited they are. \n\nListen my whole post boils down to this: Society is trying to censor our dreams. People in communist countries knew this as it was overt. People in our society are not aware of this as the mind control is covert. \n\nFuck your safe spaces, fuck your sensibilities. Everyone should be able to talk shit about everyone. When people try collecting privilege points by being a minority of some kind it is fucking disgusting and pathetic. \n\nEveryone knows there is racism from everyone else. To try and suppress it only makes it worse (Yugo is a good example of this). This need for safe spaces is pathetic. There is this sentiment that I've seen espoused that: \"oh reddit is so racist lately, etc.\" is bullshit. There are redditors who are racist fucks, others who are SJWs, feminists, MRAs, and all kinds of other things. My post is attacking this newspeak I see all around me where they promote an ideology of going so far as censoring people's dreams. \n\nEdit: \n\nAnother example: When Stalin would make a speech the audience would have to clap and support him. If someone stood up and said no, I don't agree and you are wrong they would take him out later, kill him and dissapear him. \n\nMuch more dangerous however would be the person who would get up and say: \"Hey! Don't you know we are not allowed to criticize Stalin!? \n\nThis is what I am talking about when I say we are not allowed to say we are not allowed to say something. \n\n", "id": "czdj872"}, {"comment": "I think people are just fearful of what our narrative becomes, and that's where the anti-racism, \"you can't say that\" vibe comes from. \n\nThere's a sense of modern morality that people have acquired, it comes from heavily emphasizing things such as, *the genocide of the Native Americans was very, very bad*, *Hitler exterminating the Jews was the epitome of pure evil*, *slavery was an atrocious thing* while we where being brought up. So anything that smacks of racism gets criticized harshly. \n\nTo be honest, I don't see the problem with this either. We criticize people who speak with racist overtones because of the value judgement that it's a backwards, unhelpful, and in many cases actively harmful way to be. Here in the US, you have a right to speak your mind, but that doesn't mean you wont face criticism about what you say.   \n\nI'm not talking about joking around with your friends either, but when you publicly speak in a racist manner, I think you open yourself up to all the valid criticisms and disapproval that will come your way because of it.

There has been plenty written about this and denying it is like denying climate change.  If you think European systems are so great, look at the history of their top position (president, prime minister, etc).  It's almost always controlled by one of two parties because voters vote strategically, as they should.\n\n\nHaving more than two political parties in such a voting system creates the *Spoiler Effect*.  If Al, George, and Ron are running, and Al and Ron are very similar, the vote is split between Al and Ron.  George wins even though a minority of voters preferred him or his policies.  This is bad for democracy.  To understand how bad it can be, please see the democratic election in the Weimar Republic, November 6, 1932.\n\n\nA few that have done their homework will argue that Instant Runoff Voting is the solution.  Please see Wikipedia for the implementation details, but I will say that it's true that IRV does a great job of encouraging multiple parties and eliminating the Spoiler Effect.  The reason it has failed in the US when tried was because of legitimacy.  The results that come out of it are much less predictable and more difficult to understand.  Democracy works best when people know why they lost and believe they were beaten fairly.  IRV makes that less clear.  Further, IRV fixes the Spoiler Effect problem by creating another one: *Favorite Betrayal*.  Wikipedia has a great summary of this, but the short of it is that in IRV, in some situations, a voter can actually *hurt* their favorite candidate by rating them the highest.  Is this better or worse than vulnerability to spoilers?  It's hard to say.\n\n\nIt's fashionable to rip on the two party system in the US, but in all fairness, it is a predictable, elegant system.  Everyone understands it and, combined with the primaries, we have a lot of the flexibility of other systems.  There aren't really any great systems to replace it.  At least, none that have been formulated yet.  Please consider that next time you feel like the system is broken.  It's really not, but in a democracy of 300 million people, everyone will not get what they want.  We organize into parties and create priorities so that we get as much as possible, while losing as little as possible.\n\nEdit: I meant to say \"Monotonicity criterion\" instead of favorite betrayal.

There has been plenty written about this and denying it is like denying climate change.  If you think European systems are so great, look at the history of their top position (president, prime minister, etc).  It's almost always controlled by one of two parties because voters vote strategically, as they should.\n\n\nHaving more than two political parties in such a voting system creates the *Spoiler Effect*.  If Al, George, and Ron are running, and Al and Ron are very similar, the vote is split between Al and Ron.  George wins even though a minority of voters preferred him or his policies.  This is bad for democracy.  To understand how bad it can be, please see the democratic election in the Weimar Republic, November 6, 1932.\n\n\nA few that have done their homework will argue that Instant Runoff Voting is the solution.  Please see Wikipedia for the implementation details, but I will say that it's true that IRV does a great job of encouraging multiple parties and eliminating the Spoiler Effect.  The reason it has failed in the US when tried was because of legitimacy.  The results that come out of it are much less predictable and more difficult to understand.  Democracy works best when people know why they lost and believe they were beaten fairly.  IRV makes that less clear.  Further, IRV fixes the Spoiler Effect problem by creating another one: *Favorite Betrayal*.  Wikipedia has a great summary of this, but the short of it is that in IRV, in some situations, a voter can actually *hurt* their favorite candidate by rating them the highest.  Is this better or worse than vulnerability to spoilers?  It's hard to say.\n\n\nIt's fashionable to rip on the two party system in the US, but in all fairness, it is a predictable, elegant system.  Everyone understands it and, combined with the primaries, we have a lot of the flexibility of other systems.  There aren't really any great systems to replace it.  At least, none that have been formulated yet.  Please consider that next time you feel like the system is broken.  It's really not, but in a democracy of 300 million people, everyone will not get what they want.  We organize into parties and create priorities so that we get as much as possible, while losing as little as possible.\n\nEdit: I meant to say \"Monotonicity criterion\" instead of favorite betrayal.

I miss my friends from Syria, I know they have 2 children about 10 and 6 years old, and I am aware of them attempting to flee the state, although I have no idea if they where successful or not. Moral of the story is being a refugee, is completely unrelated to terrorism. Just as being gay is completely unrelated to being a nihilist. Sure there are gay nihilists, but to look at a secondary characteristic of a minority and group the majority in the same way is outright stupid.", "id": "cxy762g"}, {"comment": "We can't just allow EVERYONE who wants a less violent, peaceful life.

If you don't have a strong belief in some kind of afterlife, that's it. When you're dead, you are utterly, totally dead and never, ever coming back to consciousness. Your entire world, everything you've ever known is gone forever. \n\nIt's normal to be afraid of death. It keeps you alive long enough to pass on your genes and look after your children.

The core of his doctrine is simple enough: happiness is ultimate good; and that was enough to get him associated with blind hedonism and the search of pleasure at every turn, which is definetly not the case.\n\nWhat he meant was that happiness is the interface between us and our nature, which means that to live the happiest possible life is to live according to our humanity (which was a *big* theme for the greek ethicists). The way in which that is different from what we might call hedonism is that the happiest life involves learning to avoid pain, even those that are caused in the long run by things that pleasure us at first.\n\nNow we come to the point of this post. He felt that one of the biggest disturbances men felt came from the fear of death, and used the logic in the posted quote to justify not fearing it. The point is *not* that we should not be afraid to die because of \"oooh, I'm 14 and this is deep, look at how logical this quote is\", but because he believed that the fear of death was a factor that stopped us from living the way we should.\n\n\"Train yourself to hold that death is nothing to us, because good and evil consist in sensation, and death is the removal of sensation. A correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable \u2014 not because it gives you an unbounded span of time, but because it removes the desire for immortality. There is nothing terrifying in life to someone who truly understands that there is nothing terrifying in the absence of life.\"\n\nNow *this* is a quote that explains the whole thought process behind the one posted. It comes from one of the few works of Epicurus that survived up to today, the *Letter to Menoeceus*, which is [fully available online for free](http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/letter.html) and only takes a few minutes to read. I urge everyone who might be interested in the philosophy of life to take these few minutes and read it, it changed my life and might change yours too.\n\nTL;DR: Epicurus is fucking awesome and this quote mostly misses the point of what he was all about, and you all should read him right now.\n\nEdit: some spelling and a TL;DR correction.

The core of his doctrine is simple enough: happiness is ultimate good; and that was enough to get him associated with blind hedonism and the search of pleasure at every turn, which is definetly not the case.\n\nWhat he meant was that happiness is the interface between us and our nature, which means that to live the happiest possible life is to live according to our humanity (which was a *big* theme for the greek ethicists). The way in which that is different from what we might call hedonism is that the happiest life involves learning to avoid pain, even those that are caused in the long run by things that pleasure us at first.\n\nNow we come to the point of this post. He felt that one of the biggest disturbances men felt came from the fear of death, and used the logic in the posted quote to justify not fearing it. The point is *not* that we should not be afraid to die because of \"oooh, I'm 14 and this is deep, look at how logical this quote is\", but because he believed that the fear of death was a factor that stopped us from living the way we should.\n\n\"Train yourself to hold that death is nothing to us, because good and evil consist in sensation, and death is the removal of sensation. A correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable \u2014 not because it gives you an unbounded span of time, but because it removes the desire for immortality. There is nothing terrifying in life to someone who truly understands that there is nothing terrifying in the absence of life.\"\n\nNow *this* is a quote that explains the whole thought process behind the one posted. It comes from one of the few works of Epicurus that survived up to today, the *Letter to Menoeceus*, which is [fully available online for free](http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/letter.html) and only takes a few minutes to read. I urge everyone who might be interested in the philosophy of life to take these few minutes and read it, it changed my life and might change yours too.\n\nTL;DR: Epicurus is fucking awesome and this quote mostly misses the point of what he was all about, and you all should read him right now.\n\nEdit: some spelling and a TL;DR correction.

I feel we automatically lean towards seeing these figures as people who spout interesting concepts but exist more as wise-men, rather than philosophers in the modern sense, due to our assumption that shit written 2000+ years ago must be waaay behind.

I would link it here, but it's in Portuguese so I don't think it would be to use to many.\n\nAnyways, here are some other aspects of epicureanism that I believe antecipate early modern themes:\n\nDeism - as some other quotes posted here show, he believed that God or Gods cannot be known and thus should not be feared, and that the best use for the idea of divinity that we can have is a notion of perfection we can model ourselves after.\n\nAtomism - Epicurus was an atomist, meaning that he has a conception of atoms as the fundamental level of matter. Because of that he had a very mechanicist view of physics for the time, including an idea of swerves and collisions at the atomic level that allowed the reduction of the notion of randomness into causality.\n\nThe view that there is no afterlife of divine being that shapes morality is of course very close to modern thoughts, and the notion that human happiness is the greatest good was of course an inspiration to utilitarianism and the whole field of ethics they shape and that is basically the common sense morality in western society today.\n\nBottom line is, people give less credit to the classics than they should.", "id": "dayccib"}, {"comment": "So much good in here!\n\nWhile I was writing my comment I was thinking about his somewhat anti-afterlife thought, which is implicitly a staple of humanism - ultimately a post 16/1700 conception.\n\nMoreover, I actually wrote a short paragraph about atomism and Democritus but deleted it because I thought it wasn't relevant and I was only over-complicating things!\n\nOne thing I was thinking about too when I originally commented about the relationship of Epicurus and the early modern was the difference between reading Epicurus, St Anselm, and Mill.

I see this argument a lot, but I've never seen it substantiated.\n", "id": "d65zgu9"}, {"comment": "Justforthissuber posted something, but I'll give a run down.\n\nThe bible says that God is Love. the word it uses for love isn't the type of erotic love (Eros) or fond/brotherly love (phileos, like in philadelphia), but an overwhelmingly sacrificial love, agape. (Ah-gah-pay). That type of love is a tremendously outward focused love, not a selfish love (Paul talks about it a lot).\n\nThe core message of the NT is the Gospel--that even though mankind had set itself as an enemy to God by disobeying his Law and purpose and focused inwards selfishly on their own desires, God sent his own Son to be a sacrifice and *fulfill the Law* (fulfill the purpose of the Law and meet its demands).\n\nThe Law, specifically, refers back to a lot of different things that were included in the OT over the years. There's the Noahide law (which the Disciples in Acts actually maintain as generally good guidelines for people), there's the Abrahamic covenant (the whole circumcision thing, and the concept of sacrifice taking the place of a condemned person like the random sheep God provided so Abraham wouldn't sacrifice his son Isaac), and the Mosaic/Levitical Law (the big part being the ten commandments, and some about how to set up the Kingdom of Israel, crime/punishment/justice laws about theft and murder, bureaucratic stuff, dietary laws, others that set down further explanations of the sacrificial system, like what types of lambs and doves and animals and grains were acceptable, etc).\n\nJesus summarized the Law as basically saying Love (Agape) God with everything you've got, and love (agape) your neighbor as yourself. He said he came to fulfill the Law. Well, the Law condemns, it doesn't save or give salvation or entitle someone to heaven--the Bible says that anybody that breaks it once is guilty of breaking it all. When Perfection is the desired Goal, falling short of perfection doesn't make the cut, and perfection is what is required by the Law. It's like people trying to touch the rim in basketball--some might get close or get further than others, but if you don't touch the rim you don't touch the rim. The Bible also says that the wages of sin is death, and that nobody comes close to perfection, so essentially everyone is doomed.\n\nJesus essentially acts like a *perfect* sacrifice, fulfilling the Law--much like God provided sacrifices for people in the OT to take their place, much like the sacrifice system in the OT wiped away the sins of the people for a time, Jesus, being God *and* Man was a sacrifice that wiped away everything.\n\nSo when Jesus says he comes not to abolish the law but to fulfill it, he's not saying, alright, go nuts, the Law doesn't matter any more. He's saying the whole point is this--all fall short, falling short=death, sacrifice=life, I'm here to be the sacrifice for all who believe in me, spread that news and become more like God.\n\nAnd that's expanded upon in Paul's letters. He was a pharisee, really involved in interpreting the OT law, yet worked mostly with \"gentiles,\" or Greeks and other people. He writes a lot about the Law and what its purpose was in Romans, and the first \"pan Christian council\" in jerusalem basically set up that, based on their interpretations, while the Law was important, it wasn't something that was ever given to the Gentiles but the Jews to bring forth the Messiah. That while it was still important (especially the moral Law) and worth learning from, there was no reason to make gentile Christians subject to Jewish dietary laws, and that the sacrificial system wasn't really necessary anymore, and that the Law could not condemn any longer if one had faith in Christ--that by subjecting someone to the Law as if it was the \"requirement\" to get into heaven *completely ignored* the fact that Christ had already fulfilled the requirements.\n\nThe main problem is that a lot of people look at the Gospel and say, hey, it's saying the Law isn't important, so why bother reading it? It's worthless! Also, how terrible is it that people had arbitrary rules that led to death? But they miss the point, because without the Law, the Gospel is useless. What point is there in being told you're innocent of, say, robbing a store, if nobody ever accused you of being guilty of robbing that store? What point is there in having someone step in and take a punishment for you if there is no punishment possible?\n\nThen others look at the Law and use it to point to gay people or people who've gotten divorced or whatever and say that they're gonna burn in hell, completely ignoring that they've got sins that would have sent them to hell according to the Law as well. Internet people (some atheists) also like to point to it as an example of how Christians are still totally gonna do another Crusade if you give them the chance (sometimes, I think they would, but if so they haven't been reading the Bible well), also as a way of trying to shut down Christians online who think the NT is all that matters.\n\nNeither of those is really a good way to look at it. You can't ignore one half of the Bible to make your theology. A proper balance of the Law and Gospel (Lutheran here, so this is important for my beliefs too) is the only way to really make sense of what's going on there. I'm sure many people would disagree with this reading of Scripture, though, or say I've made it too simple.

In the failures of institutions we trust, people we love, ideas that we cherish. Things fail. Accepting that is part of life.\n\nBut some people refuse that acceptance, and refuse to be \"broken.\" These people, in the quote, are referred to with positive superlatives, but you could really apply this to any concept. This part of the quote is simply about people with strong ideologies who refuse to compromise their ideals when they're tested. Be they good or bad the world tends to kill them quickly.\n\nBut the last line to me is the most interesting because it speaks to people who have never been broken by the world. Why might someone not be broken by the world, who has no particularly strong ideology? People whose lives are never tested.\n\nYou have not broken and mended. You have not died the death of the bold.
