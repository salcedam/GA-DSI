Then with your above average intelligence your Xenophobia comes to light as you quickly claim that everyone that comes to this country is changing our laws which isn't even close to true. Then you call the vehicles in question tricycles, when all motorized formed of 3 wheeled transportation are considered vehicles and do not utilize any bike lanes and adhere to traditional vehicle laws.\n\n* brainwashed libtard media has been by far the most oxymoronic statement I've ever heard, as the vast majority of the media leans left or right. Libertarianism is a political philosophy that upholds liberty as its principal objective. Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice, emphasizing political freedom, voluntary association, and the primacy of individual judgment.\n\n* for someone that cares about karma so much, you sure do kneejerk downvote a lot and the self gilding is comical, it only took you an hour to use a second account to give it to yourself.\n\n* you then go on to claim statistics are from a bankrupt website that owns the other website you mentioned and refuse to address individual comments despite pretty much none coming your way.

(Sorry, no freeloaders allowed. Maybe if you get a job you'll have less time to complain.) For someone with a job, you are still staying awake to discuss something you're wrong about somewhere else so that the cognitive bias shifts back in your favor or because it doesn't affect your karma?\n\n* so many people are saying \"textbook Troll\" when most of the \"obvious troll\" edits come after he hit -100 down votes.", "id": "d4zqyso"}, {"comment": "Hook, line and sinker.", "id": "d4zt9i3"}, {"comment": "Not arguing at all, just pointing out that that \"libtard\" is used to describe liberals, not libertarians.", "id": "d4zrmiy"}, {"comment": "Probably correct, however, he said himself Libertarian, which is what I was addressing.

She blinks and her brow furrows, when someone is as drunk as everyone thinks this woman is, those actions become less precise. That's what cops are checking for with the flashlight-directly-in-your-fucking-eyeball test. \n\nWhen she looks over and says \"hehe, it won't pop!\" it's very easy to read her lips and imagine her timbre and pace, which is never the case for someone who's that drunk. I own a karaoke bar, this is not a new realm for me. Note that here, her eyes also stay tracked to the person she's talking to and it doesn't look like she's trying to focus on some imaginary goal posts while blinking like her eyelids are moving under water. \n\nWhen she does finally pop the balloon, the way she stops squeezing, relaxes her arms and looks down, also are much more controlled than someone who's shitfaced. Her posture doesn't rock whatsoever despite a sudden and (apparently) unexpected shift in weight. You'll notice even the most practiced drunk has trouble standing that steadily while they aren't fucking around with a balloon, if they are completely tanked. \n\n Her shoulders and elbow don't \"drift\" or sway from where she has them, showing she's completely tense and not having her nervous system suppressed like someone above a .09/.10 BAC.  \n\n\nIn summary, her fine motor skills (including facial muscles and involuntary action) are convincingly intact, her inner ear seems to be functioning to it's purpose, and her reaction time is that of a sober person. The only thing this woman is lacking, due to at the *most* 2 drinks, is any sort of forethought or understanding of mechanical forces. \n", "id": "d9int9x"}]]], "4ruxqf": ["Bit off more than he could chew", "2016-07-08 18:31:54", 7963, "https://i.imgur.com/p8bAwpV.gifv", [[332, "\"It's so big!

I loved to wander through and look at all of the cool comics and action figures, but I could never afford any of it.  My parents didn't have a lot of money, and I would rarely get an allowance.  One day I saved enough money that I could buy a few G.I.Joe comics the next time I went in.  I was super excited.  I ran in, dug back through several years worth of comics that I still had yet to read, and delicately pulled out the four earliest issues I was missing.  \n\nI stood in line, dwarfed by a crowd of gnarly teens in long black trench coats.  They intimidated me, and I tried to blend in and not be noticed.  Finally it came to the last one of them buying something cool in front of me.  He cashed out, and started to stuff his ratty chained wallet into his back pocket.  As he did, something crumpled and fell out of his hand and landed on the ground at his feet.  It was a wadded up $50 bill.  He was still talking to the cashier and didn't notice.  My eyes were locked on it.  His feet shuffled around it.  I looked up at his face.  He was turning towards the door.  I looked behind me.  There was no one else in the store.  I looked to the stack of G.I.Joe comics in the back corner and thought about how many of them I could buy with a $50 bill.  Would my mom even notice.  Would she care?  I could tell her I found it on the floor.  \n\nI watched the kid leave.  The cashier tried to get my attention to call me forward.  I hesitated until the guy was just about to walk out the door to meet up with his friends waiting in the mall.  \n\nI couldn't do it.  I lunged for the bill and ran after the guy, yelling after him like an idiot.  \n\nHe spun in a circle and sneered at me, trying to look as intimidating as possible.  I held up the $50 bill and explained what had happened.  And this punk.  This looming rat faced punk.  He laughed at me.  And his friends laughed.  He grabbed the money out of my hand and held it up in front of my face and was like, \"This is fifty dollars you little shit.  Man, you should have taken this money and ran; that's what I would have done!  Look at you like your some goody two shoes.  You're such a little retard.\"  And then he stuffed the wadded up bill back into his pants and strut away with his friends.  \n\nI quietly went back to the counter with my neatly folded dollar bills and I bought my comics.  I thought again about how I would probably never be able to catch up to the most current issues.  I would always be poor.  I would always be a little retard that chased after assholes and gave them the money they stupidly dropped.  \n\nI never was able to forget it.  And I regret nothing.  I learned a lesson that day, and it was that following the advice of assholes will likely make you an asshole.  I didn't want to be like that kid.  And if taking the money and running is what he would have done, I would gladly do the opposite to avoid being like him.  Instead I worked for my money.  I eventually was able to buy every volume of G.I.Joe.  They are in my crawl space, all in neat little sleeves.  And I worked hard in school, got a good job, and I just made about $50 while writing this story on my lunch break.  \n\nSo, screw you dude in the long black coat.", "id": "d6m6t0m"}, {"comment": "> So, screw you dude in the long black coat\n\nThis will be our motto, fuck that douche ", "id": "d6m76ry"}, {"comment": "It's not a coat, it's a duster.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "d9zlkm5"}, {"comment": "hey bot we meet again\n\nfuck you", "id": "d9zp59h"}, {"comment": "/r/botsrights\n\nThe fuck's wrong with you, man?", "id": "d9zpj6b"}, {"comment": "Womb to tomb", "id": "d9zqazu"}, {"comment": "Spawn kill", "id": "d9zr9wj"}, {"comment": "I was not prepared for that.\n", "id": "d9zc7md"}, {"comment": "/r/natureismetal", "id": "d9zckk8"}, {"comment": "please tell me someone has the subtitled version of this gif  \n  \nedit: [found it](https://i.imgur.com/H13EIWP.gifv)", "id": "d9zfgie"}, {"comment": "That was good!", "id": "d9zjhbl"}, {"comment": "Didn't seem pleased with the leftovers.", "id": "d9zcezn"}, {"comment": "At least he will get to hold the record as the deer with the shortest lifespan ever", "id": "d9zeppy"}, {"comment": "Born to die", "id": "d9ze4bb"}, {"comment": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bag1gUxuU0g", "id": "d9zeqc5"}, {"comment": ":( ", "id": "d9zfcml"}, {"comment": "I'm going to choose to believe that little guy grew up badass and raised by leopards.", "id": "d9zfrwi"}, {"comment": "Then don't watch the full video.

In this case, he wasn't - he had his hand caught in the door and was unable to get it out.  \n\nThe beating was therefore extrajudicial and counts as the kind of vigilantism that American jurisprudence actively discourages.

The legal system limits the range of imaginary scenarios by using a reasonable person standard. \n\nThe fact there wasn't a visible weapon and no evidence of the thief's ability to free himself (he takes many hits and hos hand doesn't wriggle free) renders him a non threat. \n\nI'm not disputing that people, including the driver, weren't sincerely scared. However, there is a pretty long period of time during which this thief receives a lot of very hard hits from a bat. In my opinion, the initial hit may be deemed defensive but if you watched the YouTube clip which includes the audio, the driver's words do not convey a response of fear and defense. He boasts of his superior badassness while delivering potentially lethal blows. \n\nI know that the popular feeling toward this event is overwhelmingly in favor of the driver. I know these legal assertions i make won't be popular. I just think that it is important to remember that while this thief may be what we judge him to be a scumbag, being taken up in the heat of the moment of a cathartic delivery of street justice is something that we should approach soberly. \n\nI don't think it's good for the soul to cheer for the injury and violence of a human being when the situation shows some strong evidence that it is unnecessary and delivered for a reason other than purely in the defense of oneself or others.  \n\nLet's remember that Rodney King was speeding and evading law enforcement and possibly intoxicated when he was bludgeoned to an inch of his life.

Yes in the realm of doubts one might say the driver was worried about some possible weapon. But play the tape and soon you hear the driver scream things that portray confidence.

He says things like \"I'm a bigger badass than you!\" Among many things. \n\nThe impression I get is that this young punk met the wrong man. This driver is indeed a badass. Don't get me wrong here - if my aging mother or my wife were in that bus, that's exactly the kind of driver I would want. He isn't a coward.  He will step in to stop a crime. I don't want to totally discount this fact. \n\nThe part where it crosses a line is when:\n\nThe thief is clearly immobilized and the driver ascertains and understands this tactical situation. \nThe driver then proceeds to continue to deliver extremely powerful blows against this thief. \nThere is no action or words by the thief that can be deemed threatening or dangerous after the initial couple of blows. \n\nThe driver starts out defending himself and stopping a crime in process. The driver however pushes things toward a punitive and vigilante act by the continued beatings. \n\nIt seems that when the thief offers some weak bullshit about having money to pay for the bus ride (a completely transparent and stupid lie) this triggers the driver into anger and he delivers punishment to try and extract a confession or words of contrition that the driver might find satisfactory.

Robberies are some of the most dangerous crimes to be a part of, with a potential to turn violent or even deadly very quickly.

He was trying to free his hand from the door throughout the video, after which, who knows what he would do. He's on a moving bus, running away isn't an option unless he can take the bus driver out. If he laid on the floor and surrendered I could possibly see your point, but he didn't - the fight wasn't over until the police had him.\n\nAnd no, my opinion probably wouldn't change if it was a teenager or a woman, it just may have taken fewer hits to subdue them. It might have changed if the driver were a cop, but only because cops should be trained to end the situation more decisively - so possibly even *more* violently, but with a fast resolution to better protect everyone on the bus.

I do, however, also believe that a person forfeits some of his common rights if he chooses to assault another person.  If you don't respect the rights of others to not be assaulted (violating personal space and security), others around you are justified in suppressing your assault, and defending themselves if they feel threatened.  Mob justice and beatings are not appropriate, which is why I say suppress and defend.\n\nIn this situation, I see the baton functioning as a suppression, primarily, forcing the potentially-armed (albeit one stuck in the door, yuk yuk) thief to focus on the baton, rather than any retaliatory action.  The strikes are to the upper torso and arm primarily (edited to add: he did take a shot to the kidney at the end, that's a bit more dangerous), and keep him \"in the box\".  Whether this was the driver's intention, I can't say.  I can only relate by putting myself in his position.  If someone had a knife in a bar, and I had a barstool, you better believe that I'd use it to keep him away from me and others.  I wouldn't do it to punish or exact revenge, but merely to contain him.  Even if he was trying to escape, I would do the same if I wasn't sure I could let him escape without risking myself or others.  I wouldn't beat the crap out of him just for ass-beating's sake.\n\nIf it were a woman, I'd feel the same way if she were likely to be armed in that situation.  A child, probably not, because strikes are more likely to hit the head, and their build is not as resilient as an adult's.  If the bus driver was a police officer, I have a harder time saying, because they're most likely to be in a different situation, and able to take the thief down using appropriate means (taser, physical takedown) to contain him.  The driver was constrained in his seat, and so was constrained in his available options.  He may not have been able to open the bus door while it was moving, or may have been suffering from fixation due to adrenaline response.\n\nEdit: Watched it again, that kidney shot at the end probably hurt a lot.", "id": "d9doc5n"}, {"comment": "Would your opinion change if you were traveling in a country and your passport and all of your pitiful money was stolen?

Basically the Barcelona/RM of Egypt, any other team is too small and doesn't matter, but can sometime sneak in a league championship every now and then, but for the most part it is split between these two. This rivalry makes the Yankees/Red Sox looks like child's play. Even more nastiness and drama that reaches levels it shouldn't.\n\nUsually for league games between any other two teams, or just one of these 2 teams and any other team, the ref is a domestic/Egyptian, but for this derby/rivalry match, the ref is always a foreigner so that there's no (or less) chance of corruption, bias, and favoritism. What is really cool about this GIF is that most refs who ref this match are terrified. They could get confronted and possible attacked by the players (as you can see here), they can get attacked outside the stadium after the game, stuff like that. Security is provided for them. But because they're so terrified, they usually don't want to show the red card to anyone in fear of retaliation. So for this ref to just show it like that, as in \"who wants to mess with me, I ain't scurred\", was pretty rare and awesome to see.\n\nAl-Ahly always throws a fit when things don't go their way. They're the whiniest pieces of crap on the face of this planet and have to get things their way whether legitimately or not. They have no style whatsoever. Well this GIF is exactly their style.

There is much more to tipping a fedora than a momentary loss of perpendicularity to the force of gravity. Fedora tipping is the very essence of Reddit. \n\n\n>On June 23rd, 2005, an unprecedented coincidence occurred that sparked Reddit into existence. By either mere coincidence or by the will of some greater being (fedora\nu theists out there), on that date, every single fedora on earth was tipped at the exact same moment. The gentle'energy released from such an event was so vast that it actually created a new species in the form of an online community called Reddit. The lasting effect of this event is that now, anytime a fedora is tipped, a new Redditor is born. \n\n\n>So what you are really seeing when reading about a tipped fedora is the birth of a new Redditor.

The requirements are pretty exhaustive: you must be between the ages of 11 and 15 and be at least 1.75 meters tall. Sharp vision is essential since applicants who wear glasses or contact lenses are turned away. Finally, you must be a member of the French Tennis Federation, all dues paid up! The tourney committee is already accepting applications for the 2017 Open, just head to Roland-Garros\u2019s official site.\n\nSelection day: Making the first cut is the next step. Does the candidate have the technical know-how, understanding of the game, and physical ability to shine center court at the French Open? The try-outs last a whole day, and for curious readers, you can take a sneak peek at what it\u2019s like right here.\n\nTraining: If you\u2019re among the lucky few of the 2,500 \u2013 3,000 youngsters in the running, and you make the first cut, you have to do a five-day training during your spring vacation. Physical stamina, picking up rolling balls, throwing accuracy, concentration, endurance, dexterity, speed\u2026 The best 220 are chosen to participate in the French Open.\n\nOn the clay: Once the tourney begins, the performance of each ball boy and girl is scrutinized by their coach and Roland-Garros officials to determine which kids will work the most prestigious matches.

I have eaten lots of disgusting things in my past (Asia has lots of them to offer) but this one was by far the worst thing ever.\n\nThe warning of my Japanese friends to better open this in a park or at least on my balcony should have been enough to keep me away from this. But alas, here we are.\n\nSo I open the package and I'm welcomed by a smell that I can only compare to 3 month old diarrhea by a 85 year old lactose intolerant man who had nothing to eat but chocolate milk for the last 72 hours.\nIt was vile, absolutely disgusting. I have never smelled anything in my life. And yet, I thought, maybe \"it's just smellz\".\n\nSo I managed to grab a piece with my chopsticks and hurled it into my mouth. \n\n\nHonestly, that's what eating shit must be like. I have never eaten any kind of shit, but I had to guess, this would be the taste. Rotten, shitlike and you can't get it out of your mouth.\n\nThen I tried another piece on rice.\n\n\n0/10 with rice. 0/10 anything. \n\n\nAfter the second bite, I rolled it up in 5 garbage bags and put it in the garbage collection space of my house.\n\n4 weeks later I could STILL distinctly smell that rotten stench when I entered that collection space.\n\n\nKusaya, not even once."], [3, "We need ReviewBrah to get on this case.

But that doesn't mean that this wasn't the work of a selfish dick\n\nI work in the bulk food section of a grocery store, and let me tell you, there's no shortage of selfish pricks shopping there. My job does include having to clean up any messes that happen, and when I find minimal spills or an apologetic customer informs me of a more sizeable one, I'll always go clean it up without complaint.

I live on a narrow mountain road, in a state park. I see both sides of this issue and honestly don't know what the answer is. This post is simply to show why both sides are sensitive to this subject. \n\nThe problem for cyclists: they are part of traffic and should be afforded all the same rights as a car. Most cars are assholes and don't give enough space, pass properly, etc. Cars are big and will make a cyclist go splat. \n\nThe problem for cars: Cyclists are considered part of traffic. They can become assholes (just like cars). like on the road i live on for example: 5 cyclists going 5 or so mph up a steep hill side by side. Making a car pass illegally or wait... and wait... for the road block to move. I've seen a cyclist kick a car before. Also it is an issue for automobiles that a bicycle is considered a vehicle. Which means \"impeding the flow of traffic\" laws apply to bicycles. And in all my years of living on this road i have never had a cyclist pull off and stop so I can pass, cars (sight seers) do this daily. Never seen a cyclist get a ticket for making cars line up behind them. I also see cyclists run stop signs daily. It's as if they want the laws to apply to them when it's convenient. \n\nThe funny thing is, i'm guilty of both crimes. Being an asshole driver to the cyclist who won't move over. Drafting them, then passing within a few feet of them. And the asshole cyclist who rides 5mph in the middle of the lane while a line of 5 cars honk at me. I didn't have the space to move over. There is a wall of rock and no shoulder. \n\nAgain i have no idea of a solution; short of every road having a protected bike lane outside the door zone. Which is just not feasible. \n\n\nEdit:\n\n\nTL:DR: both drivers and cyclists are selfish. They want the road to themselves. \n\nEdit2: thanks for the down votes. DILLIGAF.

As someone with some (emphasis on some) track time, how long to get through the crappy beginning phases?", "id": "d28bozk"}, {"comment": "There's two main things that matter: iRating and Safety Rating\n\niRating is basically your finish history vs. the relative difficulty of the field.  So, for example, finishing 5th out of 10 will usually raise it (slightly), whereas finishing 9th out of 10 will probably lower it.  Again, it depends on the overall rating of the field, which will vary based on who is on at any given point of the day (worldwide, so you never know who will be on when).  As your iRating increases, you'll be matched with better and better drivers, which *usually* results in less fuckwaddery, but not always as some got to where they are by driving like assholes.\n\nSafety Rating is a number based on your number of incidents per race.  Most shorter races have a 17x (17 incident) maximum at which point you get disqualified completely (and really hurts your safety rating).  A 1x is given for going off course (even if it's not specifically advantageous, course cutting gets an additional time penalty), a 2x is given for spinning out, and a 4x is given for any contact to another car beyond a very slight \"trading paint\" love tap.  I think just hitting a wall or other non-car object is a 2x.  Luckily, if you go off course, spin out, *then* wreck into a car in succession, it will just escalate to a maximum of 4x for that one incident, I think it's like a 4 second time period before it restarts the count for future incidents.  Long story short, the fewer incidents per race, the better your iRating will get.  0x will get you a big bump, 6-8x will keep you about the same, and anything over that will really start to knock it down.  You start at a 2.5 and when you hit 3.0, you get upgraded from \"rookie\" to \"D class\", which opens up some more races and gets you out of the mad house that is rookie races.  From there, it gets more complicated with minimum safety rating participation and having to be above a 3.0 in your current license at the end of the season (every 3 months) for an upgrade.  If you get to 4.0 in a license, you get an immediate upgrade instead.  I should also mention that oval and road racing have their own iRating and Safety Rating as that confused the shit out of me when I first started.\n\nBasically, improving your iRating or choosing higher safety rating races usually gets you to less douchey competition, but, say, racing Rookie Miata with a high iRating may still put you with people that have placed well, but are complete assholes on track and finish every race with tons of incidents.\n\nOh, I guess I should mention as well that it doesn't work like most other race room matching.  You have multiple events that are either one or multiple cars and a track is pre-selected for each week for each event/league/whatever you want to call it.  Races are usually run at the same time every hour, or sometimes more spaced out for less popular cars or endurance races.  So, for example, if you want to race Miata, you can race in one of the three Miata events and each will have its own specific track for that week.  If you want to race Skip Barber Formulas, there is only one group and you will have to race on whatever track there is that week, which may be DLC at $15/track.\n\nIt's a pretty confusing system, but you get used to it and it becomes second nature eventually.\n\nOverall, expect to spend a fair amount of money if you don't already have a sim rig and plan to spend a fair amount if you want to branch out into the non-included iRacing cars/tracks as it's sort of a DLC hell.

The name is the result of being the location of a pretty largely populated prairie dog town that are basically free range. I mean, they get fed but they're not in any enclosure. That's because way back in the day, when there was a prairie dog enclosure, it was not designed with a cement bottom. I think it was built in the 70s (maybe? It's been torn up for probably close to 10 years now...) & whoever designed it built the walls, but no bottom. So the prairie dogs just burrowed out & found a new home. \n\nAnother: I grew up going to this zoo all the time as a kid. Back then, the lemurs were housed in the Lied Jungle (Expedition: Madagascar hadn't been built yet) behind kind of a taut wire sort of enclosure - it looks like vertical \"bars\" of like piano wire. Lemurs are primates, and while they may be much more distantly related to humans, they're still fairly intelligent. They used to escape by just pulling the wires aside to make a wide enough hole to slip through. When walking through the jungle as a kid with my family, we round the corner & there's two ringtails just hanging out on a rock at eye level outside their enclosure. Being the goody-goody I was as a child, I tracked down a keeper & told them - I was so worried about what would happen if they escaped! The keeper laughed, said they did that all the time.

Didya know they had an umbrella with a poison dart in it? So ruthless! Good thing we never did anything nasty during the Cold War. Certainly never assassinated or tortured anybody. Certainly never overthrew democratic regimes and replaced them with military death-squads. Never used our intelligence services to suppress dissent or manipulate public opinion.

It states that a landowner may be held liable for injuries to children trespassing on the land if the injury is caused by an object on the land that is likely to attract children.[1] The doctrine is designed to protect children who are unable to appreciate the risk posed by the object, by imposing a liability on the landowner.[1] The doctrine has been applied to hold landowners liable for injuries caused by abandoned cars, piles of lumber or sand, trampolines, and swimming pools. However, it can be applied to virtually anything on the property of the landowner.\n\nThere is no set cut off point that defines youth. The courts will evaluate each \"child\" on case by case basis to see if the \"child\" qualifies as a youth.\n\nIf it is determined that the child was able to understand and appreciate the hazard, the doctrine of attractive nuisance will not likely apply.[2]", "id": "d1i0vmf"}, {"comment": "Dog was fenced and secured.
