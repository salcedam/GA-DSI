The total time for the 14 pics OP took is just under 6 minutes and assuming OP took the pictures relatively quickly, he may not have spent more than 10 minutes taking pics up there. And in that ten minutes the stars will have moved just slightly in the sky.

", "id": "d1e6d8r"}, {"comment": "I'm going for an ELI2\n\nYou have to start with atoms and orbitals. Basically, each atom has a different strength of electromagnetic force because each atom has, by definition, a different number of protons in the nucleus. More positive charge = stronger pull on negative charges, i.e. electrons.\n\nElectrons exist as probability waves within an area of probability called an orbital. It's much simpler to use [Bohr's model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model) of atoms which states that electrons fly around in orbits of different sizes surrounding the nucleus, like planets and our sun. This implies that there is a \"space\" between each orbit.\n\nRemember we are using a simplistic model to explain things that exist as probabilities. Each \"orbit\" referenced is really an electron moving into a higher energy state.\n\nBecause of the difference in EM force from the nucleus, each atom has variation in how far apart each orbit is from each other, and from the nucleus. When atoms get energized, they can either ionize and shoot off an electron or those electrons can be pushed into a higher energy state, i.e. a further orbit, as though Mercury got enough energy to jump into Venus' orbit.\n\nOf course, that additional energy must be maintained or the electron will fall back to its orbit. Mercury will go back to where it belongs. In doing so, the [energy it gained to move to the further orbit must be released](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics). The amount of energy needed to move into a bigger orbit (and therefore the amount released when it returns to the original orbit) is affected by distance of each orbit from the nucleus. It takes more energy for Mercury to make it all the way out to Saturn's orbit than it does to make it to Venus'. Remember, each atom has a different strength positive charge in the nucleus so each atom has variation in the distance between orbitals so each atom releases a unique amount of energy for each jump between orbitals. This energy is in the form of electromagnetic radiation, a small spectrum of which we perceive as visible light.\n\nTurns out that hydrogen releases enough energy to be perceived as the color red when its electrons move from shell 2 to shell 1.

Obviously this isn't really the case, since rocket engines produce a significant amount of heat, but it's \"close enough\" for a first design iteration. Once you finish the first rough iteration, you move on to a second design iteration with more accurate approximations, taking advantage of and building off of the figures acquired in the initial iteration, and repeat until the design is sufficiently accurate.

The SRBs provided about 70% of total thrust at liftoff, and would have easily destroyed the frangible nuts in the hold-down mechanism if the pyros did not fire correctly. As another poster points out, having the nuts destroyed by pyros ensured a smooth, clean separation from the pad.\n\nThere were several missions where the SSMEs were lit and the launch subsequently aborted by the flight computers (called a Redundant Set Launch Sequencer abort) before T-0 due to problems with the engines: [STS-41-D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zVN9V5uBNc), [STS-51-F](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE2R1J-cZIw), [STS-55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqVBMd0K1wA), [STS-68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03AH-tlX1Ik).", "id": "d8vlgka"}, {"comment": "Cool!

The large tan area in the upper right is the Sahara Desert, and just beyond is Saudi Arabia. The Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America are visible to the left. On the moon, we get a glimpse of the crater Compton, which is located just beyond the eastern limb of the moon, on the lunar farside.\n> \n> LRO was launched on June 18, 2009, and has collected a treasure trove of data with its seven powerful instruments, making an invaluable contribution to our knowledge about the moon. LRO experiences 12 earthrises every day; however the spacecraft is almost always busy imaging the lunar surface so only rarely does an opportunity arise such that its camera instrument can capture a view of Earth. Occasionally LRO points off into space to acquire observations of the extremely thin lunar atmosphere and perform instrument calibration measurements. During these movements sometimes Earth (and other planets) pass through the camera's field of view and dramatic images such as the one shown here are acquired.\n> \n> This image was composed from a series of images taken Oct. 12, when LRO was about 83 miles (134 kilometers) above the moon's farside crater Compton. Capturing an image of the Earth and moon with LRO's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) instrument is a complicated task. First the spacecraft must be rolled to the side (in this case 67 degrees), then the spacecraft slews with the direction of travel to maximize the width of the lunar horizon in LROC's Narrow Angle Camera image. All this takes place while LRO is traveling faster than 3,580 miles per hour (over 1,600 meters per second) relative to the lunar surface below the spacecraft!\n> \n> The high-resolution Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) on LRO takes black-and-white images, while the lower resolution Wide Angle Camera (WAC) takes color images, so you might wonder how we got a high-resolution picture of the Earth in color. Since the spacecraft, Earth, and moon are all in motion, we had to do some special processing to create an image that represents the view of the Earth and moon at one particular time. The final Earth image contains both WAC and NAC information. WAC provides the color, and the NAC provides high-resolution detail.\n> \n> \"From the Earth, the daily moonrise and moonset are always inspiring moments,\" said Mark Robinson of Arizona State University in Tempe, principal investigator for LROC. \"However, lunar astronauts will see something very different: viewed from the lunar surface, the Earth never rises or sets. Since the moon is tidally locked, Earth is always in the same spot above the horizon, varying only a small amount with the slight wobble of the moon. The Earth may not move across the 'sky', but the view is not static. Future astronauts will see the continents rotate in and out of view and the ever-changing pattern of clouds will always catch one's eye, at least on the nearside. The Earth is never visible from the farside; imagine a sky with no Earth or moon - what will farside explorers think with no Earth overhead?\"\n> \n> NASA's first Earthrise image was taken with the Lunar Orbiter 1 spacecraft in 1966. Perhaps NASA's most iconic Earthrise photo was taken by the crew of the Apollo 8 mission as the spacecraft entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve Dec. 24, 1968. That evening, the astronauts -- Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders -- held a live broadcast from lunar orbit, in which they showed pictures of the Earth and moon as seen from their spacecraft. Said Lovell, \"The vast loneliness is awe-inspiring and it makes you realize just what you have back there on Earth.\"\n> \n> More images and information from ASU's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera website\n> Image Credit: NASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nSource: [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/lro-earthrise-2015)"], [23, "Always surprised how huge Africa is and how tiny Europe is.

You could even try it out yourself if you're willing to spend a few hundred on a cheap mount and a DSLR camera if you don't have one.\n\nAstrophotography requires lots of editing and pattern analysis techniques to pull data out of a bunch of images that might not look like anything. You're always trying to increase signal and reduce noise and there a lot of ways to do that. One image with a white noisy blur might not look like anything but if you have 500 you can estimate what you're really looking at and pull out the image of a galaxy. You can pull a hell of a lot of good data out of 500 seemingly bad black raw images.\n\nSome people use filters, LRGB and hydrogen alpha and other narrowband filters. You take hundreds of images with each filter then color them the appropriate color, H-a usually being red generally because it's in the infrared.\n\nYou can't see it. It's outside of the visible spectrum. It still exists, the camera is still detecting it. That light is still hitting us. And nebulae give off a lot of this sort of light so you can really show the detail. It's not that it's not there, hitting us every day and night.\n\nHubble uses narrowband filters. People combine all sorts of images from their cameras to produce one image. The amazing thing is how much signal it has, how much useful data you have to generate the pretty images we all are used to. I can take 5000 images in my backyard but I'd never be able to extract enough signal to get close to its quality. It doesn't have to deal with atmospheric turbulence for one. Nothing on Earth can beat it.\n\nEven planetary and lunar astrophotography is a hell of a lot of editing and processing. Even the moon which you can see in a single camera shot is usually processed to all hell. People usually take an actual video of it or Mars or Jupiter and then use stacker programs to make the prettiest image from all the frames you have. You do this get rid of imperfections, noise and turbulence from the atmosphere. These pictures are probably closer to what the moon is than what we can even see.\n\nYou deal with a whole lot of noise from AP and there's always going to be a lot of processing. I don't think this makes any of it less real. In some ways, it's more real, more of a true picture of what's actually out there. Your image is much more accurate representation of what exists out there if you're going off of hours of data rather than a 1 second exposure.\n\nLight is just radiation and no matter whether it's 500 images shot with Hubble, a camera or even what we see with our eyes, we're still manufacturing an image from noisy data.", "id": "d2i5ic5"}, {"comment": "Like, *dude*, you didn't even answer hardypart's question.

I realised while falling to my death that although I didn't have enough thrust in my damaged impulse engines to arrest my fall, I might have enough time to thrust sideways against my fall and miss the planet (Planets in BC were woefully underscaled).  \nAs I gradually inched towards the flattening limb of the planet, I thought about how the mod worked - it simply added speed inverse to the square of distance to every object in the game in the direction of the planet - it didn't kill the objects' initial speed. Then it hit me that as I would pass the limb of the planet, the direction of that added speed would change, curving my course around the planet, and that if I could hit the sweet-spot in my sideways velocity, I'd just keep on curving around it. \n\nLike cold water splashed on my face, the thought rattled my brain:  \n#Orbits don't happen because things near planets magically go in circles for some reason! They happen because if you go sideways fast enough, you just fall *around* the planet!\n\nSet me up pretty well for some early successes in KSP :)", "id": "d2itomz"}, {"comment": "What's really fun is trying to understand the non circular orbits. Orbit shapes are all sections: parabolas, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas.\n\nIf you get really in the weeds, you can learn how to reshape an orbit without maneuver nodes by envisioning a cone moving around based on how you burn. If you reach escape velocity at your altitude, you create a hyperbolic trajectory. If you're launching a suborbital flight without an atmosphere, it's parabolic. Anything in between is an ellipse, with the circle being a special case where you keep your speed and altitude.\n\n****\n\nIt gets really complicated when you pass through multiple spheres of influence (\"patched conics\"). Especially when you start trying to gravity slingshot.\n\nGravity is \"conservative\" in that you don't gain or lose energy in orbit by going back to the same altitude, regardless of path taken. So a circular orbit is a constant speed and altitude (no change in kinetic or potential energy). Easy. This is also a good explanation for one body orbits being symmetrical - you can't have a different speed at the same height.\n\nBut if you accidentally cross through the Mun's SOI, you enter and exit at the same speed but you emerge at a different altitude. You gain potential energy without losing kinetic energy.\n\nHuh, well that seems to violate conservation of energy. As it turns out, *real life* slingshot maneuvers actually steal energy from the celestial body via n-body physics. In KSP they just give you the free energy. (Not that it matters - the body is so much bigger than the spaceship that its energy loss is the poster child of negligibility.)", "id": "d2iv8ig"}, {"comment": "eli5?", "id": "d2izg0k"}, {"comment": "Which part? I'm not sure I can simplify the cone thing, but the gravity thing is a little easier.\n\nGravity doesn't care how you get from point A to point B, only how high they are. If you end up back at the same height, it doesn't help or hurt you, even if you go up and down for a bazillion miles. Of course, if you're not in space you have other stuff that does steal your energy (friction), so it only matters how far you go on the ground and in the air.\n\nLet's say you live in a place like Denver with mountains to the west and plains to the east. If you drive your car through the mountains and back home, then drive the same distance into Kansas and back, you use the same amount of gas both ways. If you didn't have the air and ground friction (so, in space), it would cost the same amount of gas no matter what distance.\n\nSo when you fly around in orbit, every time you're 250 miles up, your speed has to be the same, because gravity can't make you higher and faster at the same time. The space station flies at 250 miles and 17500 miles per hour. It's always the same two numbers. That means it flies around in a circle. In Russia they have to use satellites flying in stretched out circles so they spend more time over the country - when they get really really high, they fly really really slow, and when they go around the other side (South America) they fly super fast and super close to Earth. But they always trade speed for height. They don't have to burn rockets to go higher because they never lose TOTAL energy - they only trade it for different energy.\n\n****\n\nWhen there are more planets/stars/moons than one, you kind of play the system. Because gravity pulls from all nearby objects, you start to get really annoying interactions and they start to trade energy *with each other* instead of by themselves. You can steal some of Jupiter's orbit energy to make yours higher, so you fling a satellite out of the sun's orbit (Voyager).\n\nThat's because when you fly past it, you fight it for the orbit energy around the sun. You steal its lunch money so you can buy whatever you want. But Jupiter is a bajillionaire, so even if you steal its money it won't notice, because your tiny little space ship gets a lot of bang for its buck, but Jupiter is enormous.\n\nOn earth this is like throwing a tennis ball at a running train - honey badger (train) don't care, but the tennis ball takes some of that energy and gets absolutely launched off into the distance.", "id": "d2j9gn9"}, {"comment": "Thanks, that helped!

During these movements sometimes Earth (and other planets) pass through the camera's field of view and dramatic images such as the one shown here are acquired.\n> \n> This image was composed from a series of images taken Oct. 12, when LRO was about 83 miles (134 kilometers) above the moon's farside crater Compton. Capturing an image of the Earth and moon with LRO's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) instrument is a complicated task. First the spacecraft must be rolled to the side (in this case 67 degrees), then the spacecraft slews with the direction of travel to maximize the width of the lunar horizon in LROC's Narrow Angle Camera image. All this takes place while LRO is traveling faster than 3,580 miles per hour (over 1,600 meters per second) relative to the lunar surface below the spacecraft!\n> \n> The high-resolution Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) on LRO takes black-and-white images, while the lower resolution Wide Angle Camera (WAC) takes color images, so you might wonder how we got a high-resolution picture of the Earth in color. Since the spacecraft, Earth, and moon are all in motion, we had to do some special processing to create an image that represents the view of the Earth and moon at one particular time. The final Earth image contains both WAC and NAC information. WAC provides the color, and the NAC provides high-resolution detail.\n> \n> \"From the Earth, the daily moonrise and moonset are always inspiring moments,\" said Mark Robinson of Arizona State University in Tempe, principal investigator for LROC. \"However, lunar astronauts will see something very different: viewed from the lunar surface, the Earth never rises or sets. Since the moon is tidally locked, Earth is always in the same spot above the horizon, varying only a small amount with the slight wobble of the moon. The Earth may not move across the 'sky', but the view is not static. Future astronauts will see the continents rotate in and out of view and the ever-changing pattern of clouds will always catch one's eye, at least on the nearside. The Earth is never visible from the farside; imagine a sky with no Earth or moon - what will farside explorers think with no Earth overhead?\"\n> \n> NASA's first Earthrise image was taken with the Lunar Orbiter 1 spacecraft in 1966. Perhaps NASA's most iconic Earthrise photo was taken by the crew of the Apollo 8 mission as the spacecraft entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve Dec. 24, 1968. That evening, the astronauts -- Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders -- held a live broadcast from lunar orbit, in which they showed pictures of the Earth and moon as seen from their spacecraft. Said Lovell, \"The vast loneliness is awe-inspiring and it makes you realize just what you have back there on Earth.\"\n> \n> More images and information from ASU's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera website\n> Image Credit: NASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nSource: [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/lro-earthrise-2015)", "id": "d2hotwx"}], [{"comment": "Always surprised how huge Africa is and how tiny Europe is.

Maybe it's just because \"They can't\" or the jig is up!\n\nLets see, a video camera capable of a live stream experience from the moon.  lets say $100,000.00 in total for the vacuum box it films from, hooked up to a solar and battery pack with a wi-fi signal to an existing satellite or multiples that already exist.  This can all be done on the backs of some other research project to keep cost low.  We know they can already do this tech because they where doing it already many times from the moon....so they say!  The proof is already from their own transmissions since 1969.  I'm sure the tech is smaller and more advanced since then.....after all it's NASA.  Unless that's all a lie as well.\n\nSo what's the problem?  I'm sure there are tonnes of scientists and armatures that would love to hook into a live stream from the moon for $4.99-$19.99 a month for this experience.  I'd love to watch their satellites they say are littering our planet, pass between us and the moon.  Or watch clouds form into hurricanes over our planet in real time.  OR simply to watch the sun rise and set on the earth from the moon.  They could set up a dozen cameras with different lenses so we all could switch between them and their focal lengths.  But they won't....because as far as I can tell....they are full of it.   Why not have cameras on the moon pointed at the sun , mars, mercury, venus, ect, ect?  Unobstructed views of our planets in our system; Would be very valuable for scientific research.  Hell, it would offer us proof of an alien attack or at least for knowledge of asteroids.....  Think of the views we would get of meteors bouncing through our magnetosphere!   I would tune in just to watch the northern light. This would pay for itself in no time and offer very valuable information to students/researchers/scientists/and just peoplle who want to see it.\n\nSo don't come here telling me that a few million dollars is keeping it from happening.

Three, many people, myself included, disagree with the criteria that a planet has \"vacuumed up\" or ejected other large objects in its vicinity of space.

Then later that telescope currently in space finds a new star. And then this is where my point comes in, I have the images, it's all I need, and I'm done.

JWST promises to be the new most powerful telescope in space. In the last month, the 18-segment gold-plated primary mirror for JWST was unveiled. In the featured time-lapse video taken last week, the 6.5-meter diameter mirror was raised to a vertical position. The dramatic 30-second sequence shows NASA engineers monitoring the test as room lights glint brightly off the mirror's highly reflective surface. The beryllium mirrors have been coated with a thin film of gold to make them more reflective to infrared light. The science goals of JWST include studying the workings of the early universe and the properties of planets orbiting nearby stars. Because of the mirror's great size, it will be folded for launch and then, assuming all goes as planned, dramatically unfolded again in space. The JWST, a joint mission of the space agencies of the USA, Europe, and Canada, is currently scheduled to be launched in late 2018."], [33, "They're going to put the mirror in correctly this time, right?

", "id": "d43k3a3"}, {"comment": "I assume you are talking about the Europa mission. \n\nWell there are several challenges to overcome.\n\nFirst, funding. Originally back in the early 2000's there was a proposal for a much more sofisticated mission including a pretty nice lander and an orbiter. But it was scrapped because it was so goddamn expensive. EMFM has a much tighter budget (like everything at NASA).\n\nSecond, radiation. Even though Europa is speculated to be able to harbor life, on the actual surface the radiation levels are so high you would die within hours of landing. The way it works is that Jupiter's magnetic field is extremely powerful and it basically captures all of that Sun radiation into these belts. The closer you are to Jupiter the worse it gets and Europa is pretty close. Radiation doesn't play nice with electronics.\n\nAll Jupiter missions have to deal with this problem. Juno, which will have a very low closest approach will dip deeply into these irradiated areas, one of the reasons why it's not expected to last as long as Cassini for example. So you need serious radiation protection. So that's why a fly-by mission is much, much easier than an orbiter. The probe won't spend too much time in the radiation heavy areas by only doing fly-bys. Lander would probably last only a very short time.\n\nThird, Europa is slightly (/s) bigger than 67P - the comet where Rosetta is. So getting into an orbit around it is not so easy. Not impossible, but it would require more fuel -> bigger mass -> more fuel to get it to Jupiter -> more $$$ needed.\n\nThere is ofcourse more to it, but this is the gist of it.", "id": "d43kjvc"}, {"comment": "Sorry I should have clarified, I was referring to the proposed Venus missions for the Disc.

I can only speculate.\n\nThe Discovery program is based around the idea of very cheap missions. In this case 450 mil USD. Not a lot.\n\nThe 2 Venus missions are called DAVINCI and VERITAS.\n\nCAVINCI is the lander. It would mostly study the atmosphere though, not the actual surface. My guess is that making a proper lander/atmo probe will take most of the budget.\n\nVERITAS is the orbiter which would create a topological map of the surface. Once again, there isn't enough budget for a lander as well.\n\nLike I said, I don't know for sure, but it mostly comes down to budget.

JWST promises to be the new most powerful telescope in space. In the last month, the 18-segment gold-plated primary mirror for JWST was unveiled. In the featured time-lapse video taken last week, the 6.5-meter diameter mirror was raised to a vertical position. The dramatic 30-second sequence shows NASA engineers monitoring the test as room lights glint brightly off the mirror's highly reflective surface. The beryllium mirrors have been coated with a thin film of gold to make them more reflective to infrared light. The science goals of JWST include studying the workings of the early universe and the properties of planets orbiting nearby stars. Because of the mirror's great size, it will be folded for launch and then, assuming all goes as planned, dramatically unfolded again in space.

Discovered galactic redshifts and consequently realization the universe is expanding.  \n\n**Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope** named for Italian Physicist Enrico Fermi, Winner of 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics, inventor of the nuclear reactor. Posed the Fermi Equation for the probability of extraterrestrial life. \n\n**Chandra Xray Observatory** named for Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar Indian American astrophysicist, winner of 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics for studies in Stellar Evolution. The Chandrasekahr Limit which determines the mass above which a star will collapse into a Black Hole is also named for him. \n\n**Planck Telescope** named for German Physcist Max Planck, winner of the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics for development of Quantum Theory. \n\n**ESA Herschel Space Observatory** Named for British Astronomer Sir William Herschel, discovered planet Uranus, studied and characterized nebulae as distinct objects from stars and planets\n\n**Spitzer Infrared Telescope** named for Lyman Spitzer American Astronomer and Astrophysicist. Studied  the interstellar medium/dust and its formation into stars. Invented the concept of a large scale space based telescope that eventually became the Hubble. \n\n**James Webb Observatory** named for James Webb who  \n1) executive assistant to O. Max Gardner, Under Secretary of the Treasury  \n2) director of the Bureau of the Budget for Truman then  \n3) Under Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State.   \n4) Returned to Washington in 1961 for Kennedy as Administrator of NASA.  \n\nFor seven years after Kennedy's lunar landing announcement James Webb politicked, coaxed, cajoled, and maneuvered for NASA in Washington. As a longtime Washington insider he was a master at bureaucratic politics. In the end, through a variety of methods Administrator Webb built a seamless web of political liaisons that brought continued support for and resources to accomplish the Apollo Moon landing on the schedule President Kennedy had announced  \n\nHas it really come to this?

The movie begins on June 12th with Juno 10 million miles from Jupiter, and ends on June 29th, 3 million miles distant. The innermost moon is volcanic Io; next in line is the ice-crusted ocean world Europa, followed by massive Ganymede, and finally, heavily cratered Callisto. Galileo observed these moons to change position with respect to Jupiter over the course of a few nights. From this observation he realized that the moons were orbiting mighty Jupiter, a truth that forever changed humanity's understanding of our place in the cosmos. Earth was not the center of the Universe. For the first time in history, we look upon these moons as they orbit Jupiter and share in Galileo\u2019s revelation.

Because of the filters (figure 12), there are pixels inbetween the filters that get \"spectral crosstalk\" and are removed from the image:\n\n>\"First, each exposed frame is read out to the spacecraft and the desired bands are extracted\ninto 128-pixel-high \u201cframelets\u201d, editing out the unused lines between filters which may suffer\nfrom spectral crosstalk.\"\n\nThe image used for flat fielding, Figure 19, shows the \"interband masked areas between the filters\", which are just the pixels that are ignored due to being inbetween 2 different color filters. So it's not due to \"areas (of the detector) used to store charge for readout\" as she says in follow up posts.\n\nedit: huh the link is dead now, that's too bad it was a cool document.

Almost every exoplanet discovered has been found indirectly based on how it affects the star.  The effects on the star are only large enough to detect when the planet is close to the star.\n\nThe exceptions are microlensing (not really possible in this istuation) and direct imaging.  The direct imaging planets are hard to do and can only be done with very young, large, hot planets. We're seeing the light that's put out by the planet itself rather than the starlight reflected off the planet.\n\nThe hypothetical planet is smaller and very cold.  We can't see its light; we can only see the sunlight reflected off the planet.  On top of that, there are so many objects in the sky that you can't really tell it's a planet unless you see it move, so you have to take images days apart and then try to figure out if any of the really faint dots moved a bit and make sure it's not just noise.  \n\nPlus, telescopes don't have a large field of view.  Most would only be able to look at part of the Moon at once, and the Moon is only about 1/100,000th of the sky.  Not only that, but you have to stare at it for a few minutes to see the faintest parts.

Since the local space environment of Jupiter is so energetic, this gets quickly ionised - which then traps the ions in the planet's magnetic field.  As the ions drift outwards, it needs more and more energy to force them to rotate with the magnetic field, and the strength of the magnetic field is dropping away - it gets to a point where the ions ust can't rotate with the magnetic field any more.  Then you have a charge moving through a magnetic field, and that generates a force - the force is along the magnetic field lines, and so the current is forced down into Jupiter's atmosphere, though its ionosphere and back out again.

That's *exactly* how pictures in a regular camera are created, too. The only difference is that consumer cameras can capture different wavelengths simultaneously by incorporating a [Bayer filter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Bayer_pattern_on_sensor.svg/2000px-Bayer_pattern_on_sensor.svg.png) on top of the sensor. In reality, a 12 megapixel color sensor has 48 million photodiodes - 1/4th of them receive red light, 1/4th receive blue light and the remaining half receives green light. Each pixel on the resulting image is created by [mapping these three signals into a RGB image](http://i.imgur.com/5PZruHw.jpg).\n\nIn astro cameras, [you switch filters in front of the monochrome sensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gln0zlfSh5A). In principle, the image is created in an identical way - you have three different sets of color data for all pixels, which are then combined into a color image. The only difference is that the red, green and blue channels are captured one after another, but since celestial objects don't usually change their appearance in a matter of minutes, this is rarely an issue in astrophotography. Quickly moving objects captured with this technique may exhibit a [rainbow effect](http://swamplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/airplane-broken-bough.jpg).\n\nWhether the colors are \"real\" is another topic. A lot of interesting stuff happens outside the visible spectrum of human eye, that's why a lot scientific imaging is done in much broader wavelength range.

What makes the observations from STIS so special is that they don't take an image in the traditional way, but instead measure the location and time of every photon of light emitted.  As a result, the aurora can be observed as a movie, built into long integration images, or even just measured as photons arriving near Earth.\n\nAs such, we just have a measure of brightness from the planet, but conceptually that is difficult for human-brains to understand, so we assign different numbers of photon counts to different intensity values.

This leads to Io, the closest moon, receiving the full force of Jupiter's tides - the moon is 80 times more volcanic than the Earth. This volcanic material is thrown out into space, and then ionised, it spreads out into orbit around Jupiter and is trapped within Jupiter's magnetic field.  As it drifts further and further out, it stops co-rotating with the planet, and sets up massive currents that flow into Jupiter's atmosphere - it is these that drive the brightest aurora at Jupiter...", "id": "d4ui9b7"}, {"comment": "Fascinating.

We were only on the supernova's future light cone 600 years ago, so for all intents and purposes it was simultaneous to events 600 years ago in our frame of reference.

But this isn't because of special relativity.\n\nSpecial relativity only matters when your inertial frame is approaching the speed of light relative to whatever events you're observing. We're not traveling at any appreciable fraction of c relative to this object, so it doesn't matter. How long it took the light to reach us is a function of distance, not special relativity.

One parsec is 3.26 light years, so this thing is 22.82 light years, which is more than eleven times the reach of our sun's dominating gravitational field. For reference, the furthest former planet Pluto with its funny orbit is ever from the sun is 49.319 AU (one AU or astronomical unit being the distance between the Earth and the Sun), which is 0.000790625 light years.\n\nSpace is big.\n\nI'm not sure about the light. I'm not even remotely an expert, but I've read that the safe distance is somewhere north of fifty light years, so anything directly illuminated by its remnant afterwards has a good chance of having been lethally irradiated in the process anyway. But that's not the only issue. Life takes a long time to develop (at least we assume it does) and supernova remnants are expanding incredibly quickly, at up to 10% of the speed of light within the first couple of hundred years and they cool down within less than 10000 years. So they're not in the same place for a long time, irradiate everything with all sorts of nasty radiation (briefly at least) and then the whole thing is over within the blink of an eye (by cosmic standards). Not ideal for life as we know it.\n\nTo stress it again, I'm not an expert.

Most of the stars in the image show a tiny bit of movement from a lack of alignment, and without a closer look, I wouldn't be surprised if those few that seem to move just a *tiny* bit more weren't actually centred more across two pixels than one (or vice versa), such that their shift into a neighbouring pixel seems more dramatic (eg. the PSF shifts the same, it just seems to accumulate more in the further pixel than other stars).\n\nThat said, there's no reason to expect that there aren't any higher proper motion stars in this field.  In fact, why don't we check - [here is an overlay with the proper motions of a number of stars in the field from the SIMBAD database.](http://i.imgur.com/OSMOXot.png)  The red arrows point in the direction of the object's movement, and the size indicates how fast they're going (not to scale with the image).\n\nIt's a little difficult to match things up, and SIMBAD doesn't give proper motions for a lot of the fainter stars, but you can see that there are some objects with quite large proper motions (eg. the star just to the left of the right pillar has a proper motion of ~60 milliarcseconds/year - not a slow star!), which barely moves in the image.  In fact, in the ~decade between these images, none of theses stars moved more than an arcsecond ... which is probably comparable to the image scale these images are being displayed at (ie. none moved more than ~1 pixel).\n\nIt's still possible that some of those fainter stars that aren't catalogued in SIMBAD do have a higher proper motion.  But the take away message is that it's hard to judge from such a simple comparison. :P\n\nAs for the star seeming to have disappeared into the gas, this is almost certainly not the case.  Those pillars are *lightyears* in size, and the density of these nebula are surprisingly low (they're sparser than most vacuum chambers we can create here on Earth).  So even when moving at a good speed, I doubt enough time has passed for a star moving into the nebula to build up enough of a column density of gas/dust behind it for it to become totally invisible to us.  Rather, these two images are made from a variety of different Hubble filters - with the older image presumably including a filter that was a bit redder (or bluer) than any in the newer image, such that it caught the tail end of some really red (or blue) star's spectral distribution.", "id": "d2f44rz"}, {"comment": "/r/theydidthemath ", "id": "d2ezycx"}], [{"comment": "Aren't they not not there anymore?

But it should also be noted that rockets throw themselves **in the same direction** as earth's spin.  And this is for the same reason that Florida is the launch site of choice for the US!\n\nThe earth's spin actually gives you free launch energy.  To be in orbit you need to be moving at 17,000mph relative to the center of mass.  At the equator, you're moving 1,000mph.  This means if you launch in the direction of earth's spin, near the equator, you only have to have your rocket achieve a ground point speed of 16,000mph.  If you were to try and achieve an orbit going the other way though, your rocket would need to achieve a ground point speed of 18,000 mph.  So the earth's rotation helps us, especially the closer to the equator you get!\n\n(Please note:  my numbers above are only rough estimates to help you get the basic idea)", "id": "d5znomg"}, {"comment": "I can actually see what you are saying in the photo itself just looking at the stars trail going in the same direction as the curve of the rocket.

It's not Photoshop, but it would not be purely \"authentic\" either.\n\nI've seen similar shots of a moon that looks immense between pyramids, for example, and I've never considered those to truly represent the moon as we generally see it. It's just that, on any given full-moon night, someone could use a lens to make the moon seem huge and I feel as though that detracts from the special occasion of this super-moon event. This was the biggest moon in sixty years! I don't really understand the point of taking the super-moon and then messing with perspective to rob it of what made it special in the first place. Is my opinion shared at all in the community?\n\nI don't mean to make this a semantic battle because your shot is beautiful and my day is better for having seen it, but I *am* curious to know how photographers define authenticity. Since you differentiated your picture from others that you've seen, I figured you'd be the best person to set me straight! \n\nThanks for sharing!", "id": "da1t55v"}, {"comment": "You're absolutely correct I came here to make a similar comment.

I like yours much more than the one to which you linked in your reply.\n\nFrom what I gathered with these replies, I guess it comes down to the fact that photography, as an art, is simply what you can capture with your equipment alone, without having to introduce secondary measures. From there, I am sure that purists could condemn how much photography equipment has evolved over the years and mourn the loss of more simplistic methods of capturing what people see, but that's a debate for another time!

However; every single decision made is altering how the image will look, from lens choice, aperture setting, ASA/ISO, time of day and ultimately composition.

One of their cosmonauts died in training and they only revealed it 25 years later. They also had a lunar program complete with a huge rocket that failed miserably that stayed hidden from the 60's to 1990. When Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space, the whole Soviet manned program was classified.

It's way harder than you think tracking a spaceship, especially one that is not yours and even more when it comes from lunar orbit and isn't on an Earth orbit, which means you don't see it coming in a predictable stable way. It just appears in the sky and lands. It takes only a few seconds from the moment it's detectable to the moment it lands. The technology in the 60's wasn't there at all to do that. It'S kind of easy when you have a link to the spacecraft and can identify it, but a foreign spaceship, it's almost impossible. Remember that in 1969, nobody had satellites that did teledetection. They had satellites that could send canisters of pictures, not the communications catching sats they have today.

They were not only not meant to hide, they were meant to be tracked, and they were meant to send information back home.\n\n> It just appears in the sky and lands. It takes only a few seconds from the moment it's detectable to the moment it lands.\n\nI just seriously doubt this. Maybe it's true if the spacecraft *wasn't* broadcasting anything and you had to scan the sky with radar or something, but, as I said, the Apollo craft were fairly noisy little buggers in the radio spectrum.\n\n[Here's how closely Apollo 8 was tracked](https://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html):\n\n> As the spacecraft began its climb outward from Earth, several amateur astronomers in the UK photographed a fuel dump from the expended S-IVB stage shortly after 18:00 UT on December 21, 1968. This event was seen, without prior notification, by F. Kent, Alan Heath, and M.J. Oates, who reports catching the cloud visually while getting off a bus.\n\n[Here's a ham who remembers tracking Apollo 17 by radio.](http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/Apollo17/APOLLO17.htm) Telemetry and voice are explicitly mentioned.

"]], [[{"comment": "Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\n\nThe Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.\n\nOur posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.\n\nThe Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.\n\nIt has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.\n\n-- Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994", "id": "d77qllv"}, {"comment": "[Here, have some soundtrack for this wonderful text & the wonderful picture] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B55FkQrXx24&list=PLgPGUn13s5OG4TuH6XndQvCnZEfNtafiO)", "id": "d77x59t"}, {"comment": "Then once you have finished with that, follow it up with this;\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YH3c1QZzRK4", "id": "d78gvvs"}, {"comment": "[And this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDJn0SQehb4)\n\nAnd you might as well join /r/SpaceMusic. :D", "id": "d78uwca"}, {"comment": "Can't upvote this album enough.", "id": "d78021y"}, {"comment": "This should always be accompanied to these types of images.

Worlds and lifetimes of experience seemed to dwell inside them. \n\n\"I can suppose that you know the beginnings - that the old world was no longer a place to call home for all, and that change was needed if we were to continue.\"\n\n\"Well, what they forgot, or neglected, to tell you was that all the promise of going to a new place, the hope of a new home and a fresh start with us mindful of the mistakes of the past and convinced that we could overcome them here, died not when we arrived - no, Man had been conquering and subjugating the wilds of nature since time immemorial - those hopes and [*chuckle*] hubris died on the journey here.\" The man walked to an outcropping in the room, poured some clear liquid into three glasses he had retrieved earlier and presented it to his waiting audience. \n\nItavia sat enthralled by the tale, clutching to her worn copy of the *Doctrine*, her anchor through all the turmoil. Tyrienne watched her out of the corner of her eye, concerned that her friend may not take to these revelations too well.\n\n\"It started purely as an academic question - how much of the old world should we establish in our new home? How much would our children - you - benefit from what was borne mainly by conflict and greediness? The debates went on for ages, at first simply with spirit and animated discussions. But soon, passionate positions of the many sides seemed to harbor a darker tone.\"\n\nTyrienne nodded and sat forward, not wanting to break the man's remembrances for fear he would think better of it. \n\n\"Soon, it turned to whether or not our potential children had earned the *right* to technologies borne of our bloodshed, if they would truly understand what they would be given on a new world, free of much of the past that been stamped so freshly in our minds.\"\n\n\"As the debates and discussions intensified, the point turned from something so benign as worth of our own children to something much worse. Murmurs of whether we should \"keep\" our technologies for life and sustenance - \"stewardship\" they said - from our progeny and keep it safe for their sake became shouting matches. It was soon apparent that much of our original crew had become enamored with being self-styled deities of our new home, lording over our own children - ageless and eternal.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it was obvious at this point that passion for hope became lust for power, and what was once academic became the front for battle lines. The fight raged, too long. By the end, when it was time to land and start anew, much of the possibilities we had brought with us had perished in the conflict. We had lost all of what could have built us up beyond the cycles and pitfalls of Man's past, and history began to repeat itself.\" \n\n\"The technologies that provided us the means to bestow life and health to our children, the new Mankind, had been lost.

They could make wings that would survive the pressures involved.  The reason they wouldn't though is because during the launch phase wings would create drag.  This would require more fuel and a bigger rocket, additionally the wings are weight that is not structure or fuel, so that added weight would mean you require more structure and fuel to the point that your rocket might not be able to make it off the launch pad.

If you look at this [chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#/media/File:Comparison_US_standard_atmosphere_1962.svg), you can see that at that altitude, there's almost no air.
