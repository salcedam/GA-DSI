It's not easy to find there, maybe make it a bit more obvious)\n\n* It isn't very obvious (at least to me), how you add additional sets, it took me some time to click on the overflow menu to find \"Add set\", maybe use a plus sign or similar?\n\n* When adding the set information, say when adding say 30 seconds for l-sit, I cannot add it with the keyboard, I have to tap the up or down arrows 30 times, so it takes some time. Especially if I have to do it for say 3-4 sets. If I  could do it via keyboard it would be much faster. \n\n* While on the subject of adding sets, it would be cool if I could clone/duplicate sets, say add a set of 30s l-sit, then duplicate it twice to get 3x30s. Just to save adding the same set 3 times. \n\n* Maybe let us input custom progression levels, in addition to the ones you already have, since some intermediates are not listed (such as decline pushups, with feet on a chair, for example)?\n\nOh, and CSV export would be great.\n\nBut anyway, thanks for this, it's an excellent app. It may make me abandon my excel spreadsheet and use it full time! :)\n\n"], [2, "Awesome!\nIf people can report issues in the [Github Issues](https://github.com/mazurio/bodyweight-fitness-android/issues) maybe some of us developers can help out fixing bugs and stuff."], [2, "i was just about to start a spreadsheet to track progress and lay out a routine. i'll give the app a go, thanks for making and sharing"], [2, "Awesome work.

I really hope this & the donate bits get you enough income from this. \n\n> to export the logged workouts but I would like to take your input in it - how do you want your data to be exported and where? CSV? XML? JSON?\n\nJSON. Mostly it won't really matter, since people will probably not that often want to edit it but here's my thoughts on it as someone who spends their days munging various bits of data:\n\nCSV is really awesome, right up until it's not. It's generally pretty concise and easy to work with, but then someone will bugger it up in excel anyway. The major issue is it's fine if you release it as a *set* of files, but only one and you're in for a world of fun where you start cramming JSON into a single cell (or multiple values in your own encoding :( )\n\nYou'll want a bunch of metadata soon even if not right now. What format version, for example? You'll change and need to support multiple versions at some point, and you don't want to have to build format detectors when you can just have an extra field in the JSON from the start.\n\nYou'll want to do something nested at some point, and right then CSV will become awful.\n\nThe encoding is part of the format (CSV has conventions rather than formats generally).\n\nXML is the same as JSON in many ways but I don't like it as much ;)\n\nFinally, I'd do something like JSON for specifying the workouts so they can be exported & shared (I'd love the community to be able to create a workout routine from the sticky and just have people download it).\n\nHowever, for logging one of the major benefits of CSV is you can just append to the file, not so with JSON. You'd be loading and adding to it repeatedly (maybe). For that, I'd really, *really* suggest JSONL.

It's not easy to find there, maybe make it a bit more obvious)\n\n* It isn't very obvious (at least to me), how you add additional sets, it took me some time to click on the overflow menu to find \"Add set\", maybe use a plus sign or similar?\n\n* When adding the set information, say when adding say 30 seconds for l-sit, I cannot add it with the keyboard, I have to tap the up or down arrows 30 times, so it takes some time. Especially if I have to do it for say 3-4 sets. If I  could do it via keyboard it would be much faster. \n\n* While on the subject of adding sets, it would be cool if I could clone/duplicate sets, say add a set of 30s l-sit, then duplicate it twice to get 3x30s. Just to save adding the same set 3 times. \n\n* Maybe let us input custom progression levels, in addition to the ones you already have, since some intermediates are not listed (such as decline pushups, with feet on a chair, for example)?\n\nOh, and CSV export would be great.\n\nBut anyway, thanks for this, it's an excellent app. It may make me abandon my excel spreadsheet and use it full time! :)\n\n", "id": "cyvsx78"}, {"comment": "Hey! :)\n\nThe overflow menu follows material design which is why it's done this way, sorry that it was confusing at the beginning but once you get it - everything follows the same pattern.\n\nI need to revisit weight/seconds/minutes as I know it's quite pain when you have to scroll into the middle (especially that weight always starts at 0kg but you have 3 sets of 100kg).\n\nI am planning to add choose weight panel for each exercise or something similar and when it comes to time, it might have a 'recently used times' panel or something like that.\n\nThere is many ideas but the design for all phones is harder :D.\n\nWhen it comes to custom exercises/progressions - a lot of people are asking about that and it's coming but not yet.

I really hope this & the donate bits get you enough income from this. \n\n> to export the logged workouts but I would like to take your input in it - how do you want your data to be exported and where? CSV? XML? JSON?\n\nJSON. Mostly it won't really matter, since people will probably not that often want to edit it but here's my thoughts on it as someone who spends their days munging various bits of data:\n\nCSV is really awesome, right up until it's not. It's generally pretty concise and easy to work with, but then someone will bugger it up in excel anyway. The major issue is it's fine if you release it as a *set* of files, but only one and you're in for a world of fun where you start cramming JSON into a single cell (or multiple values in your own encoding :( )\n\nYou'll want a bunch of metadata soon even if not right now. What format version, for example? You'll change and need to support multiple versions at some point, and you don't want to have to build format detectors when you can just have an extra field in the JSON from the start.\n\nYou'll want to do something nested at some point, and right then CSV will become awful.\n\nThe encoding is part of the format (CSV has conventions rather than formats generally).\n\nXML is the same as JSON in many ways but I don't like it as much ;)\n\nFinally, I'd do something like JSON for specifying the workouts so they can be exported & shared (I'd love the community to be able to create a workout routine from the sticky and just have people download it).\n\nHowever, for logging one of the major benefits of CSV is you can just append to the file, not so with JSON. You'd be loading and adding to it repeatedly (maybe). For that, I'd really, *really* suggest JSONL.

Some random musings from a reformed ex-con, that apply to the American prison system, specifically the California Department of Corrections (the CDC):\n\n- 22-count burpees are seen as the end-all be-all of cardio conditioning. Inside, we'd call it the machine (*la machina*) workout, and it's especially popular with Mexican/Chicano gang culture. A session of 50 22-count burpees is considered a regular workout, though some hardcore aficionados of this dreadful conditioning method will do 'double ups' (basically 100) and even 88-counts aren't unheard of. A lot of the old-time Chicano cons inside can no longer do this type of training due to bad backs and wrecked joints (paging Dr. Stuart McGill, who's proven with his research that repeated forward flexion movements done for hi-reps is bad news all around), so they just do 100 8-count burpees as a trade-off.\n\n- Bar-work is very popular with the black inmates, 'the brothers.' Almost all the units and pods that I was present in had a dip/pull-up station that was especially popular with the black inmates. I know one inmate who did 500 pull-ups - all with different grips - and 500 dips EVERY day!, 7 days a week. No rest days for that ninja. And his upper torso showed it too; I've hardly ever seen anyone so ripped and cut-up in my life.\n\n- The white guys (we called them 'the Woods' inside) love their lower body and triceps workouts. They especially loved step-ups and lunges, which they would do for massive numbers of reps. As for backarms, they really loved their backarm extensions and chair dips, which, again, they'd do for massive numbers.\n\n- A lot of inmates improvise with water-filled bags as an impromptu weight training implement. Inmates would use them for curls and rows in particular, though the COs would confiscate any water bags they found, since they were prohibited. \n\n- Flexibility and mobility training was/is practically unheard of. I never saw any inmates stretch or do any kind of mobility training. Warm-ups were also unknown. The boys would just get down and dirty with their chosen exercises from the get-go, with 10 sets of 15-20 reps being the preferred set/rep scheme for practically all group segments.\n\n- Inside, a lot of inmates would buy cheap processed foods from the commissary - Ramen noodles, cheese squeezers, bag chips, beef jerky, dehydrated rice and beans, and so on - and make something called 'spreads,' basically really high-calorie but rather nutrient-deficient meals that would be consumed after an intense workout. The science would say otherwise, but these meals would really put weight on you shockingly fast. \n\n- Form is atrocious for the vast majority of inmates. Yet despite that, they still made strength and size progress.\n\nAnyways, that's all I could think of for now, it's been many years since I finally extricated myself from the endless loop of parole violations and stints and violations and more stints, to the point now where I'm working full-time, am drug-free, and have basically put that nightmare behind me. But the psychological after-effects still remain with me. I have anxiety issues, but I'm taking care of that the responsible way, by seeing a doctor and having him choose for me the best course of options.\n\nAmerican prisons are meant to punish rather than rehabilitate. I spent 1 year of my 2 years in solitary confinement, wherein I was locked in a tiny cell for 22-23 hours a day, and suffice to say, it did nothing for my mental and emotion well-being. But I'm not bitter about it; it's just the way my life played out, and a lot of the stuff I did as a drug-addict were based on childhood traumas and violence I suffered from my father. But the past is the past, and I'm living a (relatively) good life today.\n\nHope your stint in a Norwegian prison goes by smoothly. I don't mean to take away from what will be a presumably very unpleasant experience, but please remember that many countries around the world, especially in America, the system is absolutely brutal. In your country, in seems there's a genuine desire to rehabilitate offenders, especially after they pay their dues to society. In California, you know what the authorities give you after you do your 2 or 3 or 6 years or whatever? $200 dollars of gate money and the clothes on your person the day you were arrested, with the stipulation you report to parole IN THE EXACT SAME COUNTY you were caught up in in the first place, the last place you need to go back to for the majority of us ex-cons, who would like nothing better than to start off fresh somewhere else. No housing, no jobs, no guaranteed income, NOTHING.\n\nGood luck to you friend.", "id": "d8vwnn9"}, {"comment": "I have no gold but i can give you my gratitude for investing time to share your story.\n", "id": "d8w1roy"}, {"comment": "Thanks man!

You can stretch whatever muscle you want depending on your goals. If you will do bodyweight exercsies then L-sit, v-sit, hanging leg raises are some core exercsies. I would really REALLY recommend stretching hamstrings and hip flexors so you can bring your palms to the ground and also raise your legs to 180 degrees instead of 90 degrees. Like i've only been doing about 8 days of hamstring stretches in the morning and the evening and i can already touch with my fingers to the floor with no pain!

Hope this helps someone, I rarely see this cue mentioned. \n\n\nNote: Of course ideally we should be breathing properly, but I just wanted to share that the difference between breathing is more apparent during hollow holds.

Long story short, i used to play games, i started playing guitar, forgot about them. Finding another interest is crucial in breaking a bad habit.\nWell, off I go! :P I used to play League of Legends about 2-3 years ago, as all my friends played too. It's the most addicting, but physically and mentally demanding game I have ever played. Lots of great times with my friends, but they were a minority. I used to play long hours, and that led to fights with my parents, my friends and I saw myself preferring LoL from getting out and enjoying life. After about 2 years of playing I started playing Hearthstone, as lots of streamers in League of Legends played It while waiting for a game to load. After about a month of playing hearthstone I got bored with playing league. It just hit me hard in the head one day and I called it quits. The hearthstone thing went on for about six months. Then I suddenly just uninstalled it one day.\nThe reason? Guitar, and music in general. Perhaps my only bigger love than exercising. I owe guitar (and exercise) EVERYTHING. They are the two things I love doing right now and I want to keep doing them forever! I got to leave the offensive subreddits of those games, for the more welcome ones like this one. Also, I stopped fighting with my parents, and after my friends -shortly after- stopped playing too, we got out a lot more and I even had two relationships after that change in my life!

We liked that it was more varied than running until you puked and doing calisthenics until you died. We also liked that it hit multiple fitness domains in a more time efficient manner than doing a full blown strength and conditioning routine (even if the results weren't as good).

If you've never trained those muscles in your torso like that, then your strength in those new exercises will be much less and your propensity for injury will be higher too. \n\nAnyway, as a beginner, I'm doing good with just the basic progression, but your post confused me.

Methane-producing bacteria in the colon feed on raffinose and release gas in the process. There's nothing you can do to broccoli and other crucifers to cut down on the gas they induce. Extra cooking just makes them unpalatable and destroys vitamin content (incidentally, cooking broccoli in aluminum or copper pots also destroys vitamins and ruins flavor). The extent to which your body produces gas depends on the types of bacteria in your colon that break down foods for digestion - we all are born with unique assortments of gut flora.\n> \n> * Broccoli and the other vegetables you mention are so good for you that it's worth making an effort to minimize their gas-producing effects so you can enjoy their health benefits. You can try eating yogurt, kefir, or buttermilk regularly, to boost the friendly bacteria in your colon. Taking probiotic supplements, like lactobacillus GG, might be an even better way to do this. Lemon juice with meals can also be helpful. And limiting high-fat foods can reduce bloating and discomfort and help the stomach to empty faster, allowing gases to move more readily into the small intestine. You can also try taking Beano before eating your broccoli. Available at health food stores, it is made from a plant-derived enzyme that breaks down raffinose before it enters the colon, thus reducing gas production.\n> \n> * In addition, you might experiment by eating very small amounts of broccoli every day, gradually increasing your intake to see if you can build up tolerance to it. Finally, fennel seeds can help expel gas from the digestive tract - try chewing and swallowing a half teaspoon at the end of a meal. Indian grocery stores sell sugarcoated fennel seeds as digestive aids.\n> \n> [Andrew Weil, M.D.](http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA366540)"], [1, "I eat a half pound of spinach in a shake each day, and regular quantities of broc, lentils, and black beans.

Methane-producing bacteria in the colon feed on raffinose and release gas in the process. There's nothing you can do to broccoli and other crucifers to cut down on the gas they induce. Extra cooking just makes them unpalatable and destroys vitamin content (incidentally, cooking broccoli in aluminum or copper pots also destroys vitamins and ruins flavor). The extent to which your body produces gas depends on the types of bacteria in your colon that break down foods for digestion - we all are born with unique assortments of gut flora.\n> \n> * Broccoli and the other vegetables you mention are so good for you that it's worth making an effort to minimize their gas-producing effects so you can enjoy their health benefits. You can try eating yogurt, kefir, or buttermilk regularly, to boost the friendly bacteria in your colon. Taking probiotic supplements, like lactobacillus GG, might be an even better way to do this. Lemon juice with meals can also be helpful. And limiting high-fat foods can reduce bloating and discomfort and help the stomach to empty faster, allowing gases to move more readily into the small intestine. You can also try taking Beano before eating your broccoli. Available at health food stores, it is made from a plant-derived enzyme that breaks down raffinose before it enters the colon, thus reducing gas production.\n> \n> * In addition, you might experiment by eating very small amounts of broccoli every day, gradually increasing your intake to see if you can build up tolerance to it. Finally, fennel seeds can help expel gas from the digestive tract - try chewing and swallowing a half teaspoon at the end of a meal.

In this case, up to a point it just isn't an issue. After that point, it seems to be an issue, but there are so many other factors at work that it's nearly impossible to implicate eggs. Referring to this very study, the one with funding issues you are concerned about states, in reference to the Physician Study (which has no egg money)\n>  Indeed, in this study [21], male physicians consuming a higher intake of eggs were also following other unhealthy behaviours including reduced frequency of exercise and increased smoking, and had a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension.\n\nThese are fairly common findings, and there are often many more confounds present that can, and may very well actually, account for the entirety of the observed risk.

Veganism entails morality, while plant-based doesn't necessarily. Also, being that most people and groups **hate** extremist groups that go against the status quo (eating animal products in this case), wouldn't it be likely that their case would be dismissed as ludicrous and unbiased?\n\nThat wasn't the case at all. The DGAC actually strengthened its cholesterol limitations, showing that they agree with the research that implicates dietary cholesterol as a cause of CVD, etc. And this is only further reinforced by the fact that the Egg industry has an infinite amount of money to use on legal cases and lobbying in comparison to the tiny PCRM, and yet the Egg industry was still unable to trick or bribe the DGAC into publishing looser cholesterol limits. This points to a few possible conclusions: the research funded by the egg industry is biased and isn't credible; or, the research is not strong enough on its own to relieve eggs of their bad reputation. \n\nSource: http://www.pcrm.org/USDA.\n\n>I think the main point here is that eating a few eggs a few times a week is really, really far down the list of potential health risks.

A few (2-3) eggs a week probably won't lead to any serious health risks (especially when coupled with exercise and not smoking), but that sadly isn't the reality of people's diets. Most people consume well above one egg a day, and that's not even taking into account the other products they may also consume that contain eggs in them. \n\n>These are fairly common findings, and there are often many more confounds present that can, and may very well actually, account for the entirety of the observed risk. \n\nIn studies that do not account for confounding factors I agree with this; however, there are studies and meta-analysis' that do take other factors into account. For example, this meta-analysis only allowed certain studies to be used (17 out of 222, to be exact) based on how well they were able to eliminate other factors and pinpoint dietary cholesterol and its relation to serum cholesterol.

The advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may therefore still be valid.\n\nIt's only a 2.1% increase, but it is still an increase. The shocking thing about this meta-analysis is that it only allowed **100 mg** extra, when the average American already eats 2-3 eggs a day! If someone ate an extra egg on any given day, that's nearly double the amount allowed for in the studies, which translates to a probable double increase in risk (depending on their initial cholesterol intake).\n\n>When you look at the studies that claim to incriminate animal products, eggs, red meat, etc. you tend to find that there is little to no meaningful information about what plants people ate, or how often, or how consistently, and the nutritional data collected is almost always self-report, and self-reports are verifiably unreliable.\n\nI agree that self-reports are unreliable, but there are many well-done observational and epidemiological studies that eliminate the uncertainty of verifying participants data.

Yes, our body does produce most of the cholesterol we need (75% in the liver and the remainder in the small intestine) but eating a very low cholesterol diet causes our liver to produce MORE cholesterol which is why clinically a low-cholesterol diet alone usually doesn't lower serum HDL or LDL.

I will definitely look into doing something like this with the next update (e.g. add an auto play option to settings).\n\nI agree that Warmup should not be logged. I am thinking about extracting warmup into it's own routine without logging - what do you think?\n\nThere is no two edit buttons. The top \"reps logger\" you see is the fastest way to just \"click\" the button in order to log the reps into the database. If you need to remove them or edit them - there is a white button which allows for more advanced options. There is a simple reason for that - anything else just clutters UI like hell. Each exercise remembers how many reps you did last time (there are + and - buttons there on top) which makes it quick to just click once and move to another exercise.\n\n\"Have a global timer from the start of the workout during the whole thing. When I get to the end, it stop and logs everything. No need to log each one individually. Pressing \"next\" is where is should automatically log that.\"\n\nThis is bit harder. An app does not know how many reps and sets have you done, what if you just go to workout to look at one exercise and you click through exercises? There is a lot of reasons why I haven't done it this way but I have a plan to add \"a global timer\" which starts when you start and stops when you finish everything. The implementation is bit harder :).\n\n\"maybe the first time I go through it, prompt me for my progressions, #sets and #reps\" - I like that.\n\n\"split side plank into left/right, merge the neck mobility into one\" - I will think about splitting side plank but I would need to create another video for it - not sure if that makes a lot of sense. I just log 2 sets of 1 minute each when doing this exercise. I just released an update which puts neck mobility into one exercise.\n\n\"default HS to 5mins and support to 3mins\" - I am planning to add default times to each exercise but the idea is that you can save reps/time per exercise so you can set it to whatever you like. Not everyone can do 5 minutes by default.\n\n\"add a rest timers\" - I am hoping to do it for the next minor update - something like a global timer which does not go away when you move between different screens in the app.\n\n\"put sets within the \"next\", so I don't have to go forward (to pullup), forward (to dip), back (to pullup), forward, back, forward, forward, etc\"\n\nThe idea between next/previous is that you switch between exercises. Switching between sets/reps is a nice idea but it would change way too much for all the user at once.

This is really important.\n\nLooks like your update just fixed the cropping issue with the number, since you removed the timer/rep count bit....however, be prepared for feedback there, because it was the only way to do rest timers.\n\n...and here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/52vtmr/app_no_longer_has_timers/\n\n> I agree that Warmup should not be logged. I am thinking about extracting warmup into it's own routine without logging - what do you think?\n\nI would actually keep it together, since I think everyone would go through from start to finish (warmup->bodyline->skill->strength). Well, I do. Just seems some things don't really need rep logging, like cat/cow. You do 5-10. That's it. And you don't likely skip them, so knowing you did the warmup is good enough. It's not bad that it does though. What's most important here is it just taking you through all the dynamic stretches.\n\n> There is no two edit buttons. The top \"reps logger\" you see ...\n\nI guess the issue is that there are two icons with the same \"edit\" icon. I think it's confusing. The other thing (just my opinion) is there are 9 UI interactions on those page (1 less now you've removed the timer), and I just think that's too many and they can be make more intuitive.\n\nWhen you are on exercise, you primarily need to see: the exercise you're on, how many reps you need to do (i.e. from last time), and something to say \"I've done it\". In addition, you should have a way to change progression, access to images/video.\n\n> \"Have a global timer from the start of the workout during the whole thing. When I get to the end, it stop and logs everything. No need to log each one individually. Pressing \"next\" is where is should automatically log that.\"\n\nI just like to see how long I've been working out. Something that started from zero and tells me I've been doing it for 1hr 10mins so far. This isn't the same as logging per exercise (although would be there too).\n\n>  I will think about splitting side plank but I would need to create another video for it \n\nDon't worry. That's me being really picky, but when I started my right side was different time than my left, so I tracked both.\n\n> I am planning to add default times to each exercise but the idea is that you can save reps/time per exercise so you can set it to whatever you like. Not everyone can do 5 minutes by default.\n\nRight, I was meaning how the RR says 5-10 mins for skills. However, you also need to track time per skill. More difficult. Personally, I set a timer for 5 mins and do my 3x handstands within it. But it's more difficult to track/log it.\n\n> I am hoping to do it for the next minor update - something like a global timer which does not go away when you move between different screens in the app.\n\nOr when you've clicked the next button. Instead of going to the next exercise page, it goes to a 90s countdown page. I am finishing off some wireframes of my UX design, will post soon.\n\n> The idea between next/previous is that you switch between exercises. Switching between sets/reps is a nice idea but it would change way too much for all the user at once. I might look into doing an advanced mode which does that.\nWhen it comes to pairs - I am sorry but I am not going to add this one into the app.\n\nI understand what you mean here. Maybe when there is a \"custom\" exercise builder it would be possible. I would plan my routine literally to be: pullups, rest, dips, rest, pullups, rest, dips, rest, pullups, rest, dips, rest, squat, rest.....\n\nThat way I don't have to keep track of which set I'm on, it's just built in. I click next, it tells me what I'm to do.\n\n> There is a notification every time you log something (reps or time).\n\nThe only issue with that, is sometimes I didn't see it - did it happen. Anyhow, kind of redundant. If it's logging all the time, no need to tell me everytime. I can't think why I wouldn't want to log - but clicking a log then have to click next is an extra step.\n\n", "id": "d7o520h"}, {"comment": " I really love the app. But there are som differences with the RR and the apps routine.

Whether you work out or not. On workout days, on rest days, on holidays and on weekends.\n\n**Step 1: Progressive Change**\n\nIf you wake up at, say, 8am every day (for example) then trying to wake up at 5am off the bat is gonna kill you and no matter how much motivation you have your sleep cycle is fucked and if you aren't used to being up at that time you definitely aren't gonna work out then, much less even wake up and get out of bed.\n\nInstead, ease your body into it. Begin by waking up 30 minutes earlier for 3 or 4 weeks, and use that 30 minutes as the first building block for your morning routine (Explained below) until you are waking up atleast 95% of the time on time (because no one is perfect, and life happens sometimes that gets in the way). then wake up 15-30 minutes earlier than THAT for the next 3-4 weeks. Eventually, you will be waking up more consistently at your goal time, but you may find through this process you will learn that you may prefer a different time to wake up than your original goal. maybe it was too ambitious or just impractical for your life schedule, or maybe you aimed too late and want to go even earlier! That's for you to decide.\n\n**Step 2: Get enough sleep**\n\nOne important point now that you are waking up earlier, is you now have to go to bed earlier. You need to be getting 7-9 hours of sleep every night on average, as a guideline. Every body is different and needs different amounts of sleep so perhaps yours is different to that guideline or lies specifically within that range, which you should take note of. However it will obviously change depending on whether or not you've have a really heavy workout earlier that day, or sat on your ass all day. If you are going to be waking up at the SAME TIME every day, you need to go to bed at the SAME TIME every day. \n\nSpend some time, learn how much sleep your body needs, and plan your 'beddy bye time' accordingly.\n\n**Step 3: Make your sleep worth it**\n\nYou need to improve the quality of your sleep so you feel well rested and more energetic once you do have to wake up. I won't type out loads because I've already written an article jam packed with fun tips for improving sleep quality here:\n\nhttp://www.nick-e.com/how-to-lose-fat-by-sleeping/\n\n**Step 4: Morning Rituals and Developing a Routine**\n\nHaving something to do that forces you to wake up in the morning will help. If its something you enjoy, that's easy. If its something you HAVE to do, that'll definitely get you there. \n\nIn terms of actually getting yourself out of bed, placing your alarm away from your bed is the best way to force yourself out. Some people don't think that's good enough though and will often slip back into bed after completing the challenge of turning off the alarm.\n\nHere are a few tips to get over that, if you are a very heavy sleeper:\n\n* Get a loud-ass alarm, or attach your alarm to a speaker so you literally can't ignore it.\n\n* If you use your phone, install an app (there are loads out there) that make you scan a series of registered items in your house (maybe on the other side of the building?) before the alarm will shut off.\n\n* Have 5 alarms set to go off 1 after the other, so even if you do shut off the alarm, you will have to get RIGHT back out of bed FIVE TIMES in quick succession and by then you won't even want to get back into bed.\n\n* If none of those things work, you need to reevaluate something else in your life (e.g. sleep length? quality?) Because it shouldn't be THIS hard to wake you up.\n\nHowever, if you are getting good sleep that is of sufficient duration, it won't be hard to get OUT of bed, just hard to stay alert in the morning if you aren't a morning person.\n\nThings like stepping outside or sticking your head out the window and taking 5 deep breaths works wonders to wake you up gently. Don't work out RIGHT after waking up, but DO 'warm-up' or do some gentle limbering or stretching exercises to get blood flowing and de-stiff yourself.\n\nA little less gentle, wash your face with cold water (added benefit of regular hygiene routine) and give yourself a few gentle slaps to the face.\n\nLeast gentle, and one of my favourites is start taking ice cold showers, as cold as they can go, and take them right after you wake up! I love cold showers now and I have been taking them for a few months now.\n\n**Step 5: Consistency**\n\nSleeping in is not a 'gift' to yourself. If you are sleeping enough regularly you shouldn't need to, and if you do, you are ruining your sleep cycle. Learn to love mornings and wake up at the same time every day to the best of your ability. Sleeping in at weekends just because you 'can' promotes the wrong attitude about sleep, and makes you think of waking up as the enemy, and psychologically links it with having to go to work every week day, which sucks."], [22, "Open your eyes, say out loud \"Today is fucking AWESOME!\"\n\nNow roll out of bed, take a shit, and start those warmups.

While I'm cooling off from my workout, I'll read (something that I enjoy) while laying in my hammock if it's not too cold.  \n\n5. **Keep your wake up schedule as consistent as possible.** I usually don't work out on the weekends, so I used to sleep in, but that made it hard to go back to waking up at 5 on Monday. To keep my routine consistent, I still wake up at 5 on the weekends, but I do something else I enjoy (play some video games, typically).

If you time it so that you wake up during one of the lighter portions of the cycle it is easier to wake up, as opposed to trying to wake up in the REM/deep sleep portion where it is much harder to get your mind into an alert and ready-to-go state.\n\nWhat I have done (and results may vary) is pick a time I wanted to wake up, in this case 5am.

"]], [[{"comment": "Before you can workout in the morning, you must first be able to wake UP in the morning. Whether you work out or not. On workout days, on rest days, on holidays and on weekends.\n\n**Step 1: Progressive Change**\n\nIf you wake up at, say, 8am every day (for example) then trying to wake up at 5am off the bat is gonna kill you and no matter how much motivation you have your sleep cycle is fucked and if you aren't used to being up at that time you definitely aren't gonna work out then, much less even wake up and get out of bed.\n\nInstead, ease your body into it. Begin by waking up 30 minutes earlier for 3 or 4 weeks, and use that 30 minutes as the first building block for your morning routine (Explained below) until you are waking up atleast 95% of the time on time (because no one is perfect, and life happens sometimes that gets in the way). then wake up 15-30 minutes earlier than THAT for the next 3-4 weeks. Eventually, you will be waking up more consistently at your goal time, but you may find through this process you will learn that you may prefer a different time to wake up than your original goal. maybe it was too ambitious or just impractical for your life schedule, or maybe you aimed too late and want to go even earlier! That's for you to decide.\n\n**Step 2: Get enough sleep**\n\nOne important point now that you are waking up earlier, is you now have to go to bed earlier. You need to be getting 7-9 hours of sleep every night on average, as a guideline. Every body is different and needs different amounts of sleep so perhaps yours is different to that guideline or lies specifically within that range, which you should take note of. However it will obviously change depending on whether or not you've have a really heavy workout earlier that day, or sat on your ass all day. If you are going to be waking up at the SAME TIME every day, you need to go to bed at the SAME TIME every day. \n\nSpend some time, learn how much sleep your body needs, and plan your 'beddy bye time' accordingly.\n\n**Step 3: Make your sleep worth it**\n\nYou need to improve the quality of your sleep so you feel well rested and more energetic once you do have to wake up. I won't type out loads because I've already written an article jam packed with fun tips for improving sleep quality here:\n\nhttp://www.nick-e.com/how-to-lose-fat-by-sleeping/\n\n**Step 4: Morning Rituals and Developing a Routine**\n\nHaving something to do that forces you to wake up in the morning will help. If its something you enjoy, that's easy. If its something you HAVE to do, that'll definitely get you there. \n\nIn terms of actually getting yourself out of bed, placing your alarm away from your bed is the best way to force yourself out. Some people don't think that's good enough though and will often slip back into bed after completing the challenge of turning off the alarm.\n\nHere are a few tips to get over that, if you are a very heavy sleeper:\n\n* Get a loud-ass alarm, or attach your alarm to a speaker so you literally can't ignore it.\n\n* If you use your phone, install an app (there are loads out there) that make you scan a series of registered items in your house (maybe on the other side of the building?) before the alarm will shut off.\n\n* Have 5 alarms set to go off 1 after the other, so even if you do shut off the alarm, you will have to get RIGHT back out of bed FIVE TIMES in quick succession and by then you won't even want to get back into bed.\n\n* If none of those things work, you need to reevaluate something else in your life (e.g. sleep length? quality?) Because it shouldn't be THIS hard to wake you up.\n\nHowever, if you are getting good sleep that is of sufficient duration, it won't be hard to get OUT of bed, just hard to stay alert in the morning if you aren't a morning person.\n\nThings like stepping outside or sticking your head out the window and taking 5 deep breaths works wonders to wake you up gently. Don't work out RIGHT after waking up, but DO 'warm-up' or do some gentle limbering or stretching exercises to get blood flowing and de-stiff yourself.\n\nA little less gentle, wash your face with cold water (added benefit of regular hygiene routine) and give yourself a few gentle slaps to the face.\n\nLeast gentle, and one of my favourites is start taking ice cold showers, as cold as they can go, and take them right after you wake up! I love cold showers now and I have been taking them for a few months now.\n\n**Step 5: Consistency**\n\nSleeping in is not a 'gift' to yourself. If you are sleeping enough regularly you shouldn't need to, and if you do, you are ruining your sleep cycle. Learn to love mornings and wake up at the same time every day to the best of your ability. Sleeping in at weekends just because you 'can' promotes the wrong attitude about sleep, and makes you think of waking up as the enemy, and psychologically links it with having to go to work every week day, which sucks.", "id": "d3uebby"}, {"comment": "I highly recommend the Sleep Cycle app. It tracks your movement/sounds while you sleep and wakes you up gradually, at the best time in your sleep cycle to wake (within a pre-defined time frame).

Just google '90 minute rem sleep cycles' and read up on some articles.  The TL;DR is that the body goes through cycles of \"light\" sleep and \"deep\" sleep, usually running in 90 minute intervals all through the night.  If you time it so that you wake up during one of the lighter portions of the cycle it is easier to wake up, as opposed to trying to wake up in the REM/deep sleep portion where it is much harder to get your mind into an alert and ready-to-go state.\n\nWhat I have done (and results may vary) is pick a time I wanted to wake up, in this case 5am.  Count back in time in 90 minute segments so that you are getting a good 7-9 hours of sleep.  Whatever the time is after counting back is the time you should be going to bed.  If you are a light sleeper like my wife, you may need to give yourself a little more time to go to bed.  If you are like me and can pass out in 5-10 minutes then the time you pick should be good.

I saw quick gains in flexion, but had major deficits in shoulder extension that i'm still opening up. shoulder external rotation drills are also critical. \n\nthere are a lot of drills from the GB programming for these goals. they mostly come from the mobility sections for the hollow back press and handstands (the handstand mobility is basically a lot of weighted dislocate variations). the ring mobility is also helpful for scapular mobility and elbow prep, but i sometimes just do that on my straight arm days.\n\ni do rows and front lever work on the same day as bridges to encourage the scapular retraction. i don't do pullups that day though; i try to avoid internal rotation on this day (just something i'm playing with that seems to help).\n\nafter all that shoulder/scap mobility, i'll actually start working on thoracic extension/bridges. one big key is to make sure that you are not using lumbar extension at the expense of both hip and thoracic extension. it's not wrong to extend the lumbar spine, but it should extend last after you have extended the hell out of your hips and thoracic spine first.\n\nto correct the hips, make sure you are activating your glutes, lower abs, and obliques. imagine you are planking, or doing body levers/dragon flags/reverse planche. this should correct your hips. a quick queue is to look at your knees. if your knees are bending, you are probably entering into lumbar extension. the straighter you can keep your knees throughout all variations, the more likely you are using your thoracic spine.\n\ni want to reiterate that because it was my lightbulb moment when i felt my thoracic extensors finally fire like crazy: if you keep your knees straight and flex your glutes hard, when you try to extend your spine, your lumbar spine will tend to stay locked and straight, forcing your thoracic cavity to finally fire. if you compare a picture of a typical bridge to a legit thoracic bridge, you will notice that the good thoracic bridge almost always has locked out knees, while the mediocre bridge has bent knees.\n\nthoracic bridge: http://f.tqn.com/y/gymnastics/1/S/N/8/-/-/DSC_0038.jpg\n\nin order to promote these straight legs, do your birdges with your feet elevated on a block. focus on keeping your legs very straight, so raise the block as high as you need to. as you get better, you can reduce the block height.\n\nprogressions: \n- start with seals (AKA upward dogs) and cat poses. \n- next do hip thrust bridges (scaps on the ground)\n- table tops (shoulder in support and in in extension as you hip thrust)\n- next do an elbow bridge (i didn't know this variation for a while, and it's super beneficial) - it looks like you're doing a birdge on your head except that your hands are clasped above your head so that your forearms lay on the ground, not your head\n- low bridge on head with hand on ground\n- middle bridge\n- high bridge\n\ntry develop each with straight legs and adjust the high of your feet on each variation to help perfect it\n\nintegrate these drills with each variation to build mobility/strength\n\n- static holds\n- rocking (basically presses to extension in each variation)\n- hip taps (one arm holds bridge, the other touches hip)\n- walkovers (kick one leg over to end up in a lunge)\n- inside outs (pick one arm up, rotate to a plank, then back to the bridge variation)\n\nyou can't do all the mobility drills for each one (a walkover from the table top bridge is not very practical unless you're a beast)\n", "id": "cyf949h"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the extensive response mate.

It was a few years back when I challenged myself similarly to this, and I started at the same stage. It took me about 2 months to get from doing 10 pushups at once to 60 pushups at once. What I recommend doing is setting up a calendar, where each day shows how many pushups you aim to do at once.\n\nJust as some information, I did the pushups required 3 times per day - one set normal, one set wide, and one set diamond. At the time of doing this I was also swimming twice per week, which I suppose can be exchanged for your workout. I also spaced these sets out, so that I did one set before work, one set after work, and one set before I slept. It takes 2 minutes of your time and so it's not out of your way.\n\nAn important part of this routine is the calendar. Create yourself a plan that will allow you to increase the amount of pushups you do in small increments every few days. Just as a bit of a guide, I created [a sample calendar](https://teamup.com/ks505523aace147181) for you to look at, and increases the amount of pushups to do (at once) by 5 every 5 days. This is the plan I followed. Sticking to this will actually get you to where you want in about 7 weeks. To help you understand what is going on, if we assume the date is September 18th, we would do 25 pushups in the morning, 25 after work and 25 in the evening. Each 25 in a different pushup style.\n\nYour times of your workouts may also affect when you do your pushups, such as if you do your workout straight after work - you may want to get your pushups out of the way before your workout. In this case, you would not be doing your pushups before bed, but rather doing double before your workout. I hope this helps - and it worked great for me, so I hope it works great for you too =)\n\nNinja edit: You may want to switch the calendar to '8 weeks' by using the tab at the top so you can see the workout plan.

It was a few years back when I challenged myself similarly to this, and I started at the same stage. It took me about 2 months to get from doing 10 pushups at once to 60 pushups at once. What I recommend doing is setting up a calendar, where each day shows how many pushups you aim to do at once.\n\nJust as some information, I did the pushups required 3 times per day - one set normal, one set wide, and one set diamond. At the time of doing this I was also swimming twice per week, which I suppose can be exchanged for your workout. I also spaced these sets out, so that I did one set before work, one set after work, and one set before I slept. It takes 2 minutes of your time and so it's not out of your way.\n\nAn important part of this routine is the calendar. Create yourself a plan that will allow you to increase the amount of pushups you do in small increments every few days. Just as a bit of a guide, I created [a sample calendar](https://teamup.com/ks505523aace147181) for you to look at, and increases the amount of pushups to do (at once) by 5 every 5 days. This is the plan I followed. Sticking to this will actually get you to where you want in about 7 weeks. To help you understand what is going on, if we assume the date is September 18th, we would do 25 pushups in the morning, 25 after work and 25 in the evening. Each 25 in a different pushup style.\n\nYour times of your workouts may also affect when you do your pushups, such as if you do your workout straight after work - you may want to get your pushups out of the way before your workout. In this case, you would not be doing your pushups before bed, but rather doing double before your workout. I hope this helps - and it worked great for me, so I hope it works great for you too =)\n\nNinja edit: You may want to switch the calendar to '8 weeks' by using the tab at the top so you can see the workout plan. I don't believe you can see it in default view because I set the calendar up so the workout starts on the 1st September.", "id": "d6wrct6"}], [{"comment": "Probably achievable, unless you're rocking a lot of body fat or you're very tall. \n\nBasically any extra weight will make body weight progress that much harder.", "id": "d6waz85"}, {"comment": "I'm not overweight but not light either.. will have to see", "id": "d6wm95j"}, {"comment": "bit late but i'm 210 at 6'05 with bad body fat and i'm able to do 10 pull ups and 50 push ups and i started 2 months ago. you can make it!", "id": "d6zvxdo"}], [{"comment": "I definitely wouldn't neglect the run portion, endurance and cardio, that's going to be so much of boot camp and of the physical readiness testing.", "id": "d6whpjy"}], [{"comment": "the longer you put it off, the less fit you'll be when you start service.  don't start with the goal of being 100% there in 6 months.  just start doing what you can do and building up your strength and stamina, you'll be way better off than if you did nothing and i think you will surprise yourself at how fit you'll be when you start your service!  good luck to you!", "id": "d6wm1nq"}], [{"comment": "Congrats on your enlistment!

The seminars went from being open and fun, to very weird.

Anyone who builds even part of their self esteem on the unquestioning adulation and respect of children is unlikely to handle legitimate criticism well when it comes from adults.\n"], [35, "My gymnasticbodies tale and review\n\nFirst of all, let me say that this review has been long coming. Having known how GB has changed over the years since I checked in late 2013 I have been on the edge of verbal protest. But due to diplomatic reasons and not wanting to piss off a huge player in the fitness world in which I will be working in some years I had postponed it. In the spirit of integrity I will tell my story subjectively but try to shine light on both sides\n\nI do not remember how I discovered GB. I have been looking through the internet searching for good calisthenics resources as I was transitioning from half-assed weight training and sports to body weight strength training. I found BtGB which eventually let me to GB where people were open-minded, friendly, willing to help and really put an effort into helping the newcomers. I took on that mentality myself and tried to help people the same way that I was helped, and GB was THE place to be. Fast forward to mid 2014 where things really started to change; reiterating what \u201cthecolin\u201d hinted towards people were banned, disappeared, comments and topics disappeared, I had notes warning me not help other people because they had to \u201chelp themselves first\u201d (buy F1-slang).\n\nI was eventually given Foundation 1 due to my contributions on the forums, aaaaand to make me shut up, but eventually I was put on a moderator queue myself since I could not help myself by pointing things out that were off and continuing to help people. I later decided to compromise myself by making a deal with Sommer about not venting my disagreements with GB on his forums (publicly anyway, good thing private messages exist). Reason was that I felt like I could still help people despite how the situation was changing.\n\nFast forward to today everything on GB has stagnated except for a few updates once in a while and the public forums are near death. I am not really checking in much more so I decided that, also due to the recent events, that now is the time.\n\nAt the time I was given the foundation 1 program I was hyped like everyone else. I followed it strictly for 8 months total, training at home because I had no money. Though I experienced little progress I kept going. But after some time I came to some realizations. As an example I had been stuck on tuck hollow body rocks 4 x 36r for 2 months total! All the active mobility elements were stagnant, only elements that I actually progressed in were planche and push ups. I was told that I had to keep at it and results would come but eventually I ditched it.\n\nF1 did introduce a lot of good exercises on their own but the way they are organized, the mastery templates that are too standardized, and the huge focus on endurance strength; that is something which does not fit the idea of a watered down gymnastics strength training protocol for averagely skilled adults, both on paper and in practice. If the mobility elements do not hold you back, the templates and the requirements of range of motion will \u2013 even with the stretch series active.\n\nH1 also introduces a lot of good exercises but in the end I have come to believe that the only true value of H1 is the wrist mobility exercises. They are outstanding and only comparable to what Yuri does. All that beginners should really focus on doing are wall handstand and wall planks and work their way in with good form while stretching their front side of the body. It has also been reported many times how headstand work triggers tightness and pain, and with that volume of headstand work while working on bar extensions you will be there for months to years without getting nowhere near real handstand work.\n\nThen there are all the forum dogmas. \u201cWeight training is bad for you before F4\u201d, \u201crings work after F4\u201d, \u201cdo not put weight on exercises because progressions are better\u201d. The worst ones I have heard is about the infamous \u201cconnective tissue strength\u201d; this has even been an argument for doing 5 x 60s hollow body holds. They build connective tissue strength. Wtf. I understand the need to have very strong guys with abbreviated range of motion prepare themselves before the likes of back levers and planches, but those dogmas put well-meaning and well-prepared persons off good progress. Including me. I wonder how far I would have gotten had I started to weight train more, do lower reps and do more advanced progressions. In a sense, they had me going from \u201ctoo much, too soon\u201d to \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. And I hope that by writing I can prevent someone from plateauing for months while being told the fault is with them.\n\nWhile all this is quite negative, admittedly, there are chunks of gold in the program as well. The strict adherence to form has you safe guard yourself for later advanced progressions. The forum coaches are very good at helping you, spotting faults and providing alternative solutions within the narrow spectrum of what is GB. The people are in general very supportive and motivated. There is a general lack of knowledge regarding physiology and neurology with the coaches of the forum, but anatomy-wise they are very competent.\n\nWhen we sum up this you get in my opinion a decent gymnastic strength program TEMPLATE meaning that with common sense and by avoiding the pitfalls that the forums and the programming presents you -  you can progress quite far. However, I expect that they will not continue to stay on top of the market for far, something is brewing. Now that you have to buy Fundamentals before buying any of their other programs the price tag is out of the world, completely. I used to recommend beginners to get hands on the F1 and H1 programs for the sheer purpose of being able to pick apart the program and take what is best. Given my knowledge of the programs, what is happening behind the scenes and what is to come I am NO LONGER RECOMMENDING GB. Instead, I will urge people to wait and refrain from putting money into what I believe is now a money-making project with every bit of initial idealism forced out."], [29, "Alright man- I'm sold. Naterman was one thing, Doge was another, but yeah, this shit has got to stop. Since I don't work for GB I always told myself it wasn't my concern but I don't see how I can willingly give my money to this organization any more.

However I'm sticking with it because otherwise I feel lost in the bodyweight fitness wilderness. \n\nShould we return to programming from BtGB? Should we begin compiling different ways of tweaking Foundation until it becomes something usable?

I've just restarted foundation with the release of Pro+ to everyone.

To the best of my understanding, programs are basically just PDFs with suggested day-to-day workouts. What confuses me is why people have such high expectations about this kind of approach.\n\nI can see them as a good supplement to your training (ie. learning different movements, rep ranges, etc..) but paying for a written program kind of feels like a 'no mans land'. For example, basic stuff like a HS or front lever, can be learned by trial and error. Moreover, there is a TON of free information on those types of movements online. However, for the more advanced stuff - say like a one arm HS, written programs seem super ineffective given how personalized progressing at a higher stage becomes. You would probably want to work with other people in person to help detect possible (very small) flaws.\n\nKind of along these lines: A buddy of mine is overweight, so he started paying $800/month for a personal trainer (he has the money, but fucking still). What I couldn't wrap my head around is why he thinks that he needs the advice of someone so experienced, when is all he really needs to do is learn how to run around the block a few times a week consistently.

Having known how GB has changed over the years since I checked in late 2013 I have been on the edge of verbal protest. But due to diplomatic reasons and not wanting to piss off a huge player in the fitness world in which I will be working in some years I had postponed it. In the spirit of integrity I will tell my story subjectively but try to shine light on both sides\n\nI do not remember how I discovered GB. I have been looking through the internet searching for good calisthenics resources as I was transitioning from half-assed weight training and sports to body weight strength training. I found BtGB which eventually let me to GB where people were open-minded, friendly, willing to help and really put an effort into helping the newcomers. I took on that mentality myself and tried to help people the same way that I was helped, and GB was THE place to be. Fast forward to mid 2014 where things really started to change; reiterating what \u201cthecolin\u201d hinted towards people were banned, disappeared, comments and topics disappeared, I had notes warning me not help other people because they had to \u201chelp themselves first\u201d (buy F1-slang).\n\nI was eventually given Foundation 1 due to my contributions on the forums, aaaaand to make me shut up, but eventually I was put on a moderator queue myself since I could not help myself by pointing things out that were off and continuing to help people. I later decided to compromise myself by making a deal with Sommer about not venting my disagreements with GB on his forums (publicly anyway, good thing private messages exist). Reason was that I felt like I could still help people despite how the situation was changing.\n\nFast forward to today everything on GB has stagnated except for a few updates once in a while and the public forums are near death. I am not really checking in much more so I decided that, also due to the recent events, that now is the time.\n\nAt the time I was given the foundation 1 program I was hyped like everyone else. I followed it strictly for 8 months total, training at home because I had no money. Though I experienced little progress I kept going. But after some time I came to some realizations. As an example I had been stuck on tuck hollow body rocks 4 x 36r for 2 months total! All the active mobility elements were stagnant, only elements that I actually progressed in were planche and push ups. I was told that I had to keep at it and results would come but eventually I ditched it.\n\nF1 did introduce a lot of good exercises on their own but the way they are organized, the mastery templates that are too standardized, and the huge focus on endurance strength; that is something which does not fit the idea of a watered down gymnastics strength training protocol for averagely skilled adults, both on paper and in practice. If the mobility elements do not hold you back, the templates and the requirements of range of motion will \u2013 even with the stretch series active.\n\nH1 also introduces a lot of good exercises but in the end I have come to believe that the only true value of H1 is the wrist mobility exercises. They are outstanding and only comparable to what Yuri does. All that beginners should really focus on doing are wall handstand and wall planks and work their way in with good form while stretching their front side of the body. It has also been reported many times how headstand work triggers tightness and pain, and with that volume of headstand work while working on bar extensions you will be there for months to years without getting nowhere near real handstand work.\n\nThen there are all the forum dogmas. \u201cWeight training is bad for you before F4\u201d, \u201crings work after F4\u201d, \u201cdo not put weight on exercises because progressions are better\u201d. The worst ones I have heard is about the infamous \u201cconnective tissue strength\u201d; this has even been an argument for doing 5 x 60s hollow body holds. They build connective tissue strength. Wtf. I understand the need to have very strong guys with abbreviated range of motion prepare themselves before the likes of back levers and planches, but those dogmas put well-meaning and well-prepared persons off good progress. Including me. I wonder how far I would have gotten had I started to weight train more, do lower reps and do more advanced progressions. In a sense, they had me going from \u201ctoo much, too soon\u201d to \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. And I hope that by writing I can prevent someone from plateauing for months while being told the fault is with them.\n\nWhile all this is quite negative, admittedly, there are chunks of gold in the program as well. The strict adherence to form has you safe guard yourself for later advanced progressions. The forum coaches are very good at helping you, spotting faults and providing alternative solutions within the narrow spectrum of what is GB. The people are in general very supportive and motivated. There is a general lack of knowledge regarding physiology and neurology with the coaches of the forum, but anatomy-wise they are very competent.\n\nWhen we sum up this you get in my opinion a decent gymnastic strength program TEMPLATE meaning that with common sense and by avoiding the pitfalls that the forums and the programming presents you -  you can progress quite far. However, I expect that they will not continue to stay on top of the market for far, something is brewing. Now that you have to buy Fundamentals before buying any of their other programs the price tag is out of the world, completely. I used to recommend beginners to get hands on the F1 and H1 programs for the sheer purpose of being able to pick apart the program and take what is best. Given my knowledge of the programs, what is happening behind the scenes and what is to come I am NO LONGER RECOMMENDING GB. Instead, I will urge people to wait and refrain from putting money into what I believe is now a money-making project with every bit of initial idealism forced out.", "id": "dajmwrv"}, {"comment": "> I am NO LONGER RECOMMENDING GB\n\n", "id": "dajrzy0"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the additional review.

To expand on one of your points, \"Coach\" Sommer's argument that weight training should be left until completion of F4 is patently ridiculous.

The guy that came out with the whole RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) came out with that in, I think, 1978-79 and it's been a mainstay of common recovery for decades.  About a year or two ago he came out saying he was wrong.  Mainly about the ice and the rest.  Both of which don't speed up recovery and probably slow it down.\n\nI know most people will read this and think it's crazy because it's ''such common knowledge'' to ice it.  Ice is pretty much only good to reduce pain and even that is only temporary, while it's numbing the crap out of the area.  What ice really does it cause vasoconstriction, which reduces blood flow, and to recover from injury, your main goal should be improving blood flow.  \n\nNow the other thing with runners and achilles pain is really to find out the why behind the pain.  The three typical answers are 1) general overuse from over training and not enough rest, 2) poor running form putting excessive strain through the achilles, typically through push-off, and 3) impaired mobility, with common areas being the midfoot, rear foot, the ankle itself, and the hip.  \n\nSo my 'protocol' is usually:\n\nStep 1:\n\nTry to relax the muscles and improve blood flow.  Methods include:\n\nFoam rolling (generally the calf though I'll often have people do more areas)\n\nTrigger point techniques, again to the calf, this is to be a bit more specific if they can deal with the foam roller fairly well\n\nThe light stretching OP talked about\n\nStep 2:\n\nI generally start with a lot of manual, again, mainly on calf achilles itself to some degree and then mobilizing the restrictions at the foot and ankle\n\nI also am a big fan of compression. And I use the [mobility wod 'voodoo' compression band that Kelly Starrett uses with his clients and patients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drTxhTcvLgU). \n\nThen I slowly transition to Step 3:\n\nStep 3 is more of the strengthening stuff that OP talked about, both doing the eccentrics, as well as general hip and core strengthening, which many runners desperately need.  \n\nSorry that a simply question turned into to such a long answer lol", "id": "d9lcvwu"}, {"comment": ">Ideally my big question is, does it hurt all the time or just during and immediately following running? Most of my patients are pretty much fine unless they're running. They might feel some stiffness in their achilles in the morning or with walking but it's mainly running that causes the issue. Like the OP of the above protocol, I think rest is a pretty bad way to go about recovering. He didn't mention this next bit, so I'm not sure what his stance is on it but I personally don't use ice on pretty much anyone. The guy that came out with the whole RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) came out with that in, I think, 1978-79 and it's been a mainstay of common recovery for decades. About a year or two ago he came out saying he was wrong. Mainly about the ice and the rest. Both of which don't speed up recovery and probably slow it down.\n\nYeah, I don't recommend ice either. (Or RICE for that matter). \n\nIf there's pain, analgesics are better than ice. If there's swelling, compression is better than ice. There's no reason to use ice, as you don't want to slow down blood flow either. Only in the cases of extreme swelling after an acute injury to prevent secondary hypoxia is ice *maybe* recommended. Tendontis never really has extreme swelling so.. there ya go.\n\nI recommend MEAT -- movement, exercise, analgesia, treatment\n\nI probably should include that, but I figured the fact that I recommended heat would ward off the ice users.", "id": "d9llbiu"}, {"comment": "Glad you agree.  I've actually never heard of MEAT before but I like it. It's definitely a good summary of what I do at least. I figured you didn't like ice since you didn't recommend it and typically is the very first thing to come out of literally everyone's mouth.  It'll probably take years before it stops being so utilized.  Most of my patients don't come in with scripts and utilize direct access but on the rare occassion someone went to see an Ortho first, the script always says ice.

I want to be a physical therapist so I find it very interesting. A number of other users also find this interesting. \n\nAs a follow-up, Steven recommends ultra high rep, low intensity eccentrics as it seems to work in most of his patients. Do you use a similar approach? From what I have gathered some therapists like going heavier (i.e. 3x10-15 or 3x15-30) , and in my case MUCH heavier (3x5 at 80% 1rm). What do you find typically works best in your patients? \n\nYou also mentioned that you love voodoo flossing. What do you think makes it so effective? Do you think the temporary occlusion of bloodflow does anything special or is it mostly the soft tissue work that makes it effective?", "id": "d9ldkns"}, {"comment": "Good questions.  Runners can sometimes be a weary bunch of people when it comes to strengthening.  They rarely do it on their own and cite reasons like, \"I don't have time with my running plan because it has me running 5-6 days a week,\" and \"I don't want to get bulky.\"  Both of which are bullshit IMO.  As most of the users here will know, picking up some weights is not going to get you big.  It takes a lot of consistent effort and more importantly, the right meal plan with adequate calories and macros.  Most runners could probably start doing a bunch of workouts and not put on any real weight because they're never really eating at a caloric gain anyway.  The other excuse about having no time is BS because I really think that if they sacrificed one or two run days for strengthening, they'd not only prevent injuries more effectively, but they'd literally get faster and improve speed.... so they're hurting themselves by not doing it.  Sorry for ranting again, but of a pet peeve of mine when it comes to runners though.  \n\nAnyway, back to your question.   Unfortunately at my clinic, I'm often limited by time and sort of the 'philosophy' of my boss and other co-works.  We don't have any 'heavy' weights or machines so I really can't do anything close to peoples 1RM if I wanted to. I do feel that runners don't necessarily need to be able to lift big heavy weight, though I also think it'd help.  At the very least they need to be able to move their body the 26.2 miles of a marathon if that's their goal and most cant.  If you ever watch a race, go to the finish (even in something as short as a 10K sometimes) and you'll see people are dragging themselves across the finish line because they're literally too weak to move their body that far. \n\nI generally hate pretty much all lower extremity machines with the exception of some leg press/hip sled machines, though we don't have any of those either.  I, therefore, mainly do body weight exercises and will give them some, relatively, light weight like a medicine ball, some dumbbells or, my clinic also has, [ViPRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drTxhTcvLgU).    Those exercises are typically pretty similar for all of them because they're all generally weak in the same areas.  My two favorite exercises are Single Leg Deadlifts and Bulgarian Split Squats.  I like them for two reasons.  IMO all strengthening should be as functional as possible and mimic the activity as closely as possible.  A lot of PTs will do exercises like clamshells which may have a tiny bit usefulness initially but really there's no carry over into movement and running.  I like those two in particular because they are mainly single leg activities, like running, and both have  a strong emphasis on the Hamstring and glutes if done correctly.  Other I do with clients are SL squats, walking lunges, side lunges, regular squats, towel slides (which are basically lunges) etc.  The one big difference though is the way I have them do lunges.  It's not the 90/90 position that most people do because that tends place the demand on the quads, usually the area that's already overworked in runners.  I have them do it in a way to utilize their glutes much more.  We also utilize various reaches and arm drives in different planes of motion to hit the glutes in all three planes as opposed to just doing one plane of motion and only hitting a small portion.  Same thing goes with a calf stretch, I have them move throughout the stretch at the ankle joint so it's not just stretching a small sliver of the calf.\n\nAt home I'll tell them to do 3-4 sets of 10-15 ish reps of the strengthening but mainly I just want them to feel the muscles burning and them getting tired.  When it comes to the more acute states and the more real tendonitis' like you asked, with the eccentrics I try to do higher reps and will tell them to start at 10-12 but that my goal is that they're quickly doing at least sets of 20.  Especially when it comes to the achilles.  If they're running correctly, their achilles should be eccentrically loading upon initial contact though most runners are massive heel strikers and don't do that, which then requires them to push off extra are when they progress over their leg.  They don't get any ''spring'' from the eccentric loading cause they're not doing it, and by landing out in front of them they're creating a breaking impulse which they now need to overcome.  In a perfect world though, I'd love to get people to the point where they're doing heavier weights but most runners just don't care for it and it's honestly a hard sell to convince them.  \n\nAs for the voodoo bands, it's the same idea as the manual I do (deep soft tissue) and foam rolling or other self myofascial releases.  Squeeze your thumb.  When you let go it should be whiter because you squeezed all the blood out.  That deep pressure also forces the muscle to relax and is a common technique in the neurologic world of PT.  Once you remove your pressure, the thumb quickly refills with blood.  Voodoo band is the same thing, squeeze the shit out of the area, get the muscle to relax and then when you take it off is when the real work is being done because blood is just pouring into those areas.  Typically I don't leave the band on for more than 60-90 seconds.  ", "id": "d9leox6"}, {"comment": "I don't run much, but I started to get knee pain. I was running on the outsides of my feet causing all sorts of problems but that's not important to my point. While at PT I learned how to properly run. Now everywhere I look I see people with fucked up form. It's everywhere.\n\nWhy are runners so resistant to improving their form? I totally get why you are frustrated with these people.", "id": "d9lycxl"}, {"comment": "I don't know if they're so much resistant to change as they are just bad at doing the change.  I'm sure you've heard of the whole \"if you want to see a good squat, look at an infant.\"   Years of sitting at a desk in the classroom then in college and eventually the work force rob people of the mobility needed to squat well.  That same lack of mobility affects their running form.  Lack of hip extension is one of the biggest reasons.  Though they're form is also affected by footwear.  The modern running shoe only started being a thing in the mid 70's iirc. I've read lots of interesting studies on footwear and they all sort of come to the same conclusion.  The bigger shoes with the big cushy heels, promote people to run on their heels.  Having those same people run barefoot usually automatically fixes their form to some degree without instruction.  \n\nNow, years ago when minimalist shoes were all the rage, I bought a pair and tried them out and I immediately noticed the change  (I know this is just anecdotal but I've come up with a theory off this).  I no longer run in them and have returned to ASICS because I find them comfortable but I still maintain a more fore foot strike.  \nWhen I have people try to do the same thing, it's really hard for them to change most of the time, though a few do it quite well.  And this is where it is completely theory, no scientific research backing this up.  More often than not, the people that are good at adopting a \"better\" form played some sort of sport in highschool/college while everyone else didn't.  It sort of makes sense.  I've never heard of a soccer player getting Runners knee, or ITBS.  I think that's largely due to two factors. 1) Most sports are not long runs, but shorter sprints and 2) sprinting form is usually better than a slower comfortable pace because it forces you to lean forward and land more towards your forefoot.  Though I could be totally wrong with all that. \n90% of my clients never did a sport growing up and are just borderline comically uncoordinated.  They have no idea how to move or control their bodies.  Trying to teach them a lunge can sometimes take 15-20 minutes to get them to feel it in the muscles I'm trying to get them to target.  They're the ones that have the most trouble fixing their form.  ", "id": "d9mr1wg"}, {"comment": "My experience conforms to your anecdote.

Long story short after a few years with a PT and lots of personal research and training I run barefoot now and it's magnificent.\n\nI've been working my squat too. Shoulder injury kept me from doing any real strength work for years, but now that I can hold a barbell on my back and slowly come down into a nice squat stretch hold my squat form/mobility has really taken off this last month.

That is not protraction, and it seems like a common error among those people directly or indirectly affiliated with GB. Although I am certain they know the difference between the two movements, they chose to narrow it down to one for the sake of simplicity. Argueably, the thoracic rounding will not impact protraction strength that much, but learning to protract with a neutral spine will still result in a stronger position and a more aesthetic look. However, I would probably consider to teach people the rounded position for protraction if they have difficulties learning to protract without the rounding.\n\nThe point about protracting all the way down is an issue of mobility. For normal stiff people it is absolutely impossible to maintain protraction in the fully bent arm position, however serratus anterior mobility training (from scapular shrugs) will eventually allow you to maintain protraction to some degree in the bent arm position. That will be valuable for advanced exercises like planche push up variation where serratus anterior can create more force and can stabilize the shoulder blades throughout the entire range of motion. With that said the point about maintaining protraction is of less importance - as long as one does not actively retract at the bottom position. The SA range of motion can be build over time if you maintain push ups in your warm up past mastering them.

Those are pretty bad too.", "id": "datmibo"}, {"comment": "TLDR: It's 5am and I'm sleepy so I know this is fairly poorly written, but there's so many ways to eat healthy and actually save money each month. A combo meal at Chick Fil A is like $7-$10 and my dinner (Chicken/Rice/Egg/Cheese/Salsa/Onions/Peppers) cost $2.60 per serving.(740cals: 65g Protein, 60g Carbs, 27g Fat).  \n  \n---\nThe idea that eating healthy is expensive is *mostly* a myth. There are places where things like chicken/beef are more costly due to a lack of availability. Or the notion that you can't purchase anything but the organic, free-range, hugged-thrice beef. I eat 2800cals/day for right at $100/month. There are 3 basic concepts I follow in order to do this:    \n\n**1) Minimize waste**  \n  - The biggest issue that most people face when just starting to meal-prep at home is wasted purchases. Bought a bunch of fresh fruit for your snacks but decide you want donuts in the morning? Donuts consumed = $4-5 and fruit expires = $2-3. Chose to order a pizza instead of eating your already cooked batches of rice/chicken? $15/pizza and $3 thrown away when the prepared food goes bad. Eating out? Same result. Didn't meal-prep your fresh vegies before they went bad? Money gone. It's a small amount each time but when you consider 3 meals a day for 30 days, if it's $1 lost due to each poor meal decision, that's $90 gone at the end of the month.  \n\n**2) Deal shop**  \n - My local grocery store has an app that tracks their coupons. Meat at that location is roughly 25% more than it is at the Costco that's 20 minutes away. The manager specials in the meat/poultry department are an extra 20% every Thursday night. The store-brand salsa is half the price of brand-name. A lot of these sorts of scenarios come from familiarity over time. You'll learn when and how to save as you spend more time shopping.  \n\n**3) Plan ahead**  \n - I cook one full week's worth of Lunch and Dinner on Sunday nights (I cook protein-pancakes and bacon every morning). Crockpots and Ricecookers are your best friend. Mass meal-prepping reduces the need to cook three times a day (or twice if you're bringing a lunch to work). This reduces the strain people feel when they come home from a long day of work and really just want to sit on the couch and wait for the delivery guy. If it's already cooked you just heat it up and chow down; less prep and cleanup on a day-to-day basis.  \n  \n", "id": "dat4lag"}, {"comment": "When I decided to eat healthy, my food costs went way the fuck down, junk food is expensive here, for the same price of a delivered pizza I can get about 2.4 kilo of chicken, slap some broccoli, but of salsa, and some cheddar cheese in that, and I have dinner for 6 days for the price of a delivered pizza and a coke. \n\nLike keep it stupid simple most of the time, and every now and then (usually twice a month)  i go  hunting for some really good meat in the form of a roast or steaks,  and usually find it at a good price, my budget isn't as low as yours, I blame the avocados for that :-P", "id": "dat5bzq"}, {"comment": "Ya man !

Your body needs fat to survive.\n\nMainly, because fat plays an important role in many of the body's chemical structures. The first ones that leap to mind are lipoproteins, ball structures within the blood that deliver fat-soluble nutrients to the body's cells, which cannot be passed through the lymph nodes. Without sufficient fat the body can't make new lipoproteins - and you will die.\n\nSecond is the protein sparing effect of fat. In a healthy person, fat reserves provide 60% of the body's energy during rest. The body *needs* that energy, and if it can't get it from fat it will get it from protein, breaking down the body's muscles and other tissues to provide heat and power. This is actually what kills most people who perish from anorexia nervosa - the body literally eats itself, until major organs like the heart and liver cease to function.\n\nThird, fat plays an important role in the body's temperature regulation processes. Body fat at or below 5% increases your risk of heat stroke and heart attack during strenuous exercise.\n\nThere are other reasons too. These are just the big ones.\n\nAlso worth noting, the protein sparing effect makes it pretty much impossible to achieve large muscle mass *and* body fat below 5% at the same time. Unless of course you use steroids; or if you start with large muscles and lose an unhealthy amount of fat in a very short period; or if you're a teenager like OP, whose TDEE is already through the roof because of puberty, but who swims twice a day on top of it and wasn't eating enough at the time. He probably needed 4000 kcal/day back then, and not getting it resulted in the freakishly lean frame seen in pics 1 and 2.\n\nOP was playing a dangerous game in those pics. Teenage athletes - not just those bulimic and anorexic kids - who push themselves too hard have been known to die trying to reduce their fat below healthy levels. Especially in wrestling, where weigh ins are important.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/19/sports/wrestling-collegiate-wrestling-deaths-raise-fears-about-training.html?pagewanted=all", "id": "d3gkadv"}, {"comment": "Thank you so much!

Evidently, as more positive comments came in and his responses softened, the harsh words at the beginning of this thread seemed to have come out of nowhere. But after a bit more exchanges with OP, it seems like he is just nice when people agree with him. At the first sign of criticism he gets really defensive and condescending. I believe this guy does not have a healthy attitude towards criticism. Since the first comments were mostly criticism, the only side of OP that showed was that one. I tried to explain that to him but he dismissed me as he did in all those comments which got everyone fired up in the beginning, defensive and condescending as always. **So there is something I would like to say: at the time, he deserved the hate that he got. He was being an asshole and got what was coming to him. I stand by my early words in this thread. The true nature of people is shown in the face of adversity, and it's easy for OP to be nice to supportive people.

Otherwise I do not miss a workout ever.\n\n> All my workouts are calisthenics based.\n\n> Chest: 10 reps of regular, wide, 45 degree, close, jumping, then bear crawl pushups with no rest in between them. x 3 with a total of 160 pushups.\n\n> Abs: 20 reps of toe touches, leg elevated crunches, leg raises, then 1 minute of scuba steves. x 4 with no rest in between.\n\n> Legs: low weight high rep. weight is between 20-50 lbs. I do 5 sets of 20 squats. 15-25 seconds rest in between.\n\n> Arms: I just do 10 regular pull ups, 10 regular chin ups, and 10 wide grip pull ups. no rest in between.\n\n> Cardio: I run 1.2 miles every other day. When I actually go to a track I run it in 7:30 on average. Running around my block (1.2 miles) takes about 9:30. If I decide not to run, I do high intensity biking for anywhere from 5-10 miles. If I go swimming (which I recently got into again) I only swim about 1,000. 200 warm up. 5 x 100's that are timed. then one final 500 none stop. 200 cool down.\n\n> I run about 3 times a week, bike 2 times, and swim 1 time every week.\n\nThat's a lot of pushups! Definitely meeting your goals of being healthy and not getting big. Kudos to sticking with it, that's no doubt the biggest obstacle for anyone.\n\nDon't think of people \"putting you down\" in this thread, they aren't. They are merely questioning details of what you said. Don't worry about it. No one else can state you body fat other than you along with a machine/expert.\n\n", "id": "d3fvr2d"}, {"comment": "Thanks for your constructive comment. I guess everyone thinks I'm hard pressed about the 4% thing when all I'm pressing is that's what the test told me. I know I'm probably more like 10% so I'm not sure why everyone's so upset. But thanks, I was just trying to say/show people you can have a (in my opinion) nice body by just doing push ups and sit ups and yada yada. ", "id": "d3fwvwf"}, {"comment": "You say no rest whatever in between the different types of pullups.  Do you even release or do you just switch your grip while hanging?\n\nAlso, how long did it take you to get up to that point?  Did you start out with 2 for each and work up to 10?

Then then next day I did 4. Then the next day I would try for 5, if I could get it, I would stick to 4 that day and just keep trying every work out until I could do 4 or each, or 5. \n\nThat's a good question. I let go, make sure I have a good proper grip and then go back at it. That takes maybe 3 seconds? Sometimes I do just do it without going down but i've hurt my shoulder doing that previously which is why i try not to. That's just my experience though, I think If i were you I would make my goal to do it without releasing but reaaallly think about and focus on form if you're going to do that. Try not to just hand there ever. It seems to put lots of stress on the ligaments in your shoulders (again, this is just my experience.)

What's to stop you from doing more?", "id": "d3gc666"}, {"comment": "What stops me from doing more? Well, I don't want to get bigger in the areas I already work out. For example, I'd rather start incorporating elevated push ups to work my upper chest more and build muscle there than to add on another 5 push ups to each set of my routine and just get a bigger lower chest. Hopefully that makes sense. And I've been at 10 for like 2 years now. Every once and a while I go back down to 8 and REALLY focus on form and squeezing, stretching, and contracting my muscles with every push up. It gives me the craziest burn I have ever felt and makes the workout much harder. I do this because I do get sloppy as time goes on which is why i do that 'form maintenance' every so often. Why don't I do form maintenance at 10? You may be wondering. Well, because after awhile of doing my routine, my form at 10 could have become sloppy over time without me realizing it. So I try and fix it by staying at 8-9 for a couple of workouts until i'm happy with my form again and i work back up to 10.

Also rice cakes and yogurt are my best friend. Rice and beans are also an important part of my diet. \nHow don't I get tired of eating this? I do.

Please don't take the harsh criticism too seriously. I mean, it's the internet, so any time you share something having to do with your body and exercise there will always be those sorts of responses.

Sometimes people will share their routines without photos and, because it doesn't necessarily fall in line with the standard subreddit way of doing things, they'll still respond with this sort of stuff.\n\nThe important thing is that this is working for you and you were well-intentioned in sharing your experience with others to try to inspire people to be healthier and to feel great like you do. Sometimes it really doesn't take much but consistency, discipline, and effort over time to reach and maintain a respectable level of general fitness.\n\nIf you're open to changing up your routine a little bit you'll be able to get much stronger and, if you keep a good diet, you'll also put on some more muscle over time. Even putting weight into a backpack will let you do weighted push ups and pull ups/chins. Either that or you can move onto one arm push ups and harder types of pull ups without adding weight. Chest/tricep dips are great to add into your program and you can do them with two sturdy chairs. There's a lot more you can look into if you're interested such as handstands, headstand or handstand push ups, either against a wall or free-standing away from any support.\n\nThe fact that you've stuck with this for 3 years shows me that you'd be able to stick with a slightly longer routine and get amazing results.

On those days some people think you should take it easy but I try to make those days the days when I add reps. I do this because when I first ran into this problem I tried taking two days off instead of one, but that made working out the next day even harder than it had been. The next time I had a day like you were describing instead of telling myself i wouldn't be able to finish my routine that day, I told myself I was going to fucking finish this workout and more today AND I was going to do it with good form. And you know what happened? I progressed that day and in my opinion it's just because I told myself I would. It really is mind over matter. And the next day I was really sore, yes. But then the next time I went to workout, I could tell that pushing myself that day when I didn't \"feel\" like it actually made me noticeably stronger. I noticed this because at the end of 2nd set of my chest workout (where I usually felt the worst) I felt like I was just warming up. So on the last set I added one rep onto each workout and it felt like i hadn't added anything, it felt just a hard as my workouts usually do. Which, to me, told me I had gotten stronger. \n\nSorry for the wall of text. TL;DR: It's mind over matter. That's what MY EXPERIENCE has been with this anyway. That is what I do. Essentially, if you push yourself on those days that's when you will grow the most. If you take a rest, it's only going to get harder.

For example, getting to 90 degrees with your method of assessing shoulder extension completely negates the position of the scapula, the last 30-45 degrees (out of the 90 you talk of) is probably coming from the movement of the scapula against your thorax and not purely a glenohumeral motion. Why is this important? To determine what structure(s) if any, is causing the limitation. Trying to extend your shoulders that far would place a strong tension in the anterior aspect of the joint capsule and is not recommended for people with history of shoulder instability or even injuries.\n\nYou also seem to mix up stretches for the actual muscle and stretches of the capsuloligamentous structure (i.e. ligaments and joint capsule). Take a look at your sleeper stretch for example. To the contrary to what you wrote, the sleeper stretch (the internal rotation position you are in) is more of a capsular stretch, as you are horizontally adducting your shoulder (since the scapula is supposed to be stabilized against the surface you are lying on), which places tension on the posterior GH capsule, more than the increase in length you would get in your external rotators. Not to mention, the sleeper stretch being a capsular stretch, it's something that only needs to be done if your capsule is truly strict, otherwise you could end up affecting your shoulder stability and injure yourself. It's not a stretch for everyone.\n\nFor the hips, femoral anteversion/retroversion could easily account for available hip rotation ROM. Some people with excessive retroversion will hardly have any internal rotation ROM, and stretching it won't help because it's an anatomical/structural limitation and could not be changed. You can stretch the joint capsule to regain some motion in such cases, but it's hardly practical doing so in most cases.\n\nThere seems to be inconsistencies in the positions you selected for shoulder ER vs IR, and also for hip ER vs IR. In the shoulder ER, you are performing the movement in a single plane, the horizontal plane (shoulder abduction), but the internal rotation is in the sagittal plane.

This is exactly the kind of feedback I look for when posting something of this size. I, contrarily to you, am NOT a physical therapist and so I am welcoming all of this feedback very enthusiastically and want to address everything you wrote point by point so I can get on with fixing everything you've said isn't fitting for the assessment.\n\nLooking at it now, I can see the scapular compensation in my shoulder extension 'active' assessment pretty clearly.\n\nMy justification for the 90 degrees of shoulder extension being the 'good' test was that I originally came at this from the perspective of BWF/Gymnastics, and things like the German hang (and other stuff like the Manna, when more advanced) involve about 90 degrees of shoulder extension, and the ability to comfortably move in that range. \n\nI can see now that I clearly can't do that with stable scapular position, so perhaps that's something I need to work on. I will add the point about not being good for people with history of shoulder instability, and will probably also add a section saying \"90 is good if you do gymnastics, BWF or just wanna be mega flexible, 45 is good for your average joe or someone with history of shoulder instability or injury\". \n\nDoes that sound like an acceptable modification?\n\nWhen talking about the sleeper stretch, I know that's a capsule stretch, but I wasn't recommending that as a *stretch*, just as a test of internal rotation. By that I mean it should only be done once, to test your internal rotation, and not as a stretch. IF you can touch your hand to the floor as I said, you are good for IR. IF you can't, then you need to stretch your IR (in some other way!) Would you recommend I be more clear about that, or do you think I should do the opposite test to my ER test in the 90/90 shoulder/elbow position? It just seems harder to estimate and easier for people to roll their shoulders down to get more range so I thought it would be harder in what is a self assessment, and some people won't know not to, or HOW not to. You feel me?\n\nWould you say the sleeper is still a good TEST of IR, even though its not a good external rotator stretch? \n\nYeah things like femoral anteversion/retroversion are the kinds of things I don't know as much about and so that's why I tried to be careful with my words in saying \"you *probably* have one or more of the following issues\" and stuff like that, as there will always be people that it just does not apply to, due to structural differences and whatnot. \n\nI'm definitely feeling a lot of disclaimers and clarifications may be what we are looking for in terms of neatening this puppy up, based on many of your objections. What do you think?\n\nWell to be fair the hip IR was also tested from a flexed position, but I added a neutral one to account for people who couldn't do a resting squat. Admittedly that's because I couldn't think of a reasonable self assessment for IR with a flexed hip that they could a) do and b) be able to see the result of themselves. Do you have any ideas? Would you recommend adding a neutral ER aswell? Actually I think I'm just gonna add a neutral ER as well for balance anyway.\n\nIn the end this isn't really meant to mimic or even get on the same level as the kind of assessment you'd get from a physical therapist, a physio, osteo, or **ANYONE**. This is point 9000 that I really should have written down in the article, specifically in the intro, it's kind of the 'second best' for people who just wanna generally see where their mobility needs work, but don't wanna shell out cash or spend time seeing a professional, but recognising its not the same perfect assessment that you could pay for in the sense that its meant a SINGLE test meant to be applicable for a wide range of people, like the difference between buying a bespoke office chair whose butt and back have been finely crafted to fit the exact curvature of YOUR spine and booty, and just buying a chair from the chair store. \n\nAgain, thank you so much for the feedback and I'd love it if you could address the questions and points I've put forward.

I had a feeling I may have come off terse and rude, but it was more to add some insight, I'm all for these kinds of posts because it increases awareness for the general public, and also helps you learn better as you write these and get feedback on. So don't stop and keep up the work and keep on learning!\n\nRather than getting into too much specifics: one thing to consider is the difference between passive and active motion. Passive motion is when the subject is relaxed and the ROM is tested by another person, which allows the muscles to stay relaxed and prevents restrictions from muscle contraction (called muscle guarding). Active motion is when the subject moves their body through the ROM, and this assesses not only the available ROM but the functional or practical ROM that a person can move their body through, and can help delineate between restrictions of a movement due to tightness or weakness.\n\nIn regards to differentiating stretches of the muscle and capsuloligamentous structures, this is something you may have to study the anatomy and learn the positions necessary to test specific structures. Some muscles span over two joints, others span over only one - when a muscle spans over two or more joints, the position of each of those joints can apply different amounts of tension that may be required to stretch the muscle. For example, the hamstrings span over the hip and knee joint, so to correctly stretch this muscle you have to extend your knee and flex your hip joint (straighten your knee and lift your thigh up but without tilting your pelvis posteriorly), or to stretch the biceps, you would want to horizontally abduct and/or extend your shoulders back, extend your elbow, and pronate your forearm.\n\nIn regards to the sleeper stretch, you get more stretch in your joint capsule doing this, so it doesn't assess the tightness of the muscles. The standard PT way of measuring shoulder ER/IR is to lie on your stomach (prone position) with your arm out to the side (90 degree shoulder abduction) and then testing for ER/IR. Just keep in mind that you can compensate for more ROM once again by tipping your scapula, so it's important to take a measurement with the scapula stabilized (by hand or other means) or to stop rotating once you see the scapula start to tip in one direction.\n\nThere is something called the functional movement assessment (FMA) which is a screening tool that has gained popularity in the PT field in the past few years, and you can youtube and perhaps get more insight on practical methods of assessing a person's function (not just passive ROM but active ROM) to screen out possible limitations in joints in a more practical sense instead of measuring things just passively. This can especially help when assessing someone's sports or physical performance with a particular sport/task/activity, and may help give more insight.", "id": "d5cpjrz"}, {"comment": "My Occupational Therapist girlfriend told me to upvote you.", "id": "d5biyke"}, {"comment": "> For those of you that want to see a comparison of how joint mobility or ROM is assessed in physical therapy, just search for it in youtube and you will actually find plenty.\n\nSo, these can be used as mobility assessments then?

This isn't a good advice, but once you start comparing PT videos for assessing mobility/ROM, you will start to see a pattern and may eventually figure out which technique is most common and introduced in the videos.\n\nAlso keep in mind that a passive assessment of your joint does not always help with more practical movements, as restrictions of a movement may happen at a particular phase of a movement, and it's important to address the position of the joint when this is happening, and to determine if this is a limitation due to tightness or weakness or motor control or a combination of several things.", "id": "d5cpqic"}, {"comment": "As a massage therapist, I appreciate your comments, it has illuminated a bit more on my understanding on how other occupations assesses the body.", "id": "d5bklt2"}, {"comment": "Dude this is awesome.

I'm trying to work on my upper body, especially my shoulders and wrists which are a weak area, but I don't want to hurt myself, especially my shoulders since my rotator cuffs can be finicky sometimes.\n\nKnowing that you come from a ballet background, depending on your years of experience, when you started the activity, etc. your joint mobility will likely be more than of an average person, hence your joints may more likely tolerate the extremes of positions. These extreme positions could become an issue if you have any underlying injury or instability, hence why so many people can continue to do ballet and/or gymnastics and not get injured, while others do. At the same time, not everyone are equal when it comes to flexibility, some may be able to hyperextend their joints, while others may find the position to be extremely unstable and uncomfortable. I know it's not the greatest advise, but if you have a coach/trainer or someone with experience that can assess you in person, this may be enough to identify restricitons that you may have with your specific movement/activity.", "id": "d5cq1go"}, {"comment": "> just search for it in youtube and you will actually find plenty.\n\nWithout knowing absolutely anything about anatomy, it is really not that easy.

If you dig through though, you will start to find videos from lab classes from PT school and such, which may give some insight.\n\nI don't want to overcomplicate things so I will just add on that, you will start to see a trend in the ways the ROM are being assessed as you watch more videos and compare, and this perhaps may give you a better insight on which technique/position may suit your needs the best.", "id": "d5cq7h6"}, {"comment": "thank you", "id": "d5d0v27"}], [{"comment": "Thanks for putting this together!

One great example is this 4 minute tabata: 20s burpees + 10s rest, repeat 8 times. To increase load, try to do more burpees in those 20 seconds, or start doing them with jumps, or knee-to-chest jumps.

I've seen similar workout routine patterns in box lessons, similar when I tried CrossFit and similar recommendations by my serious fitness friends, and I believe they know what they are doing, but again - can't really support my arguments with personal experience of weight loss. Also diet, but in that area I truly have zero knowledge.\n\nCardio (swimming, running) is fine too, but not that effective unless you beat yourself to superb performances every time. In this kind of cardio, it's easy to fall into comfortable tempo and stop pushing limits. Therefore it's not usually that intense and you have to do it for a long time periods and after you're finished the burning stops too. Definitely do it though !

What you want is fat loss rather than weight loss. \n\n\nWeight loss should be discriminant i.e. your body discriminates between fat and muscle, choosing to lose the fat and keep the muscle.\n\n\nBy eating fewer calories per day than you need to maintain your current bodyweight, you send a signal to your body telling it to lose weight.\n\n\nBy resistance training with an appropriate volume, frequency and intensity, you also send another signal to your body telling it that its muscles are going to be placed under stress on a regular basis, and therefore they need to be kept hold of rather than let go.\n\n\nThe result is that you keep your muscle, thus maintaining your resting/basal metabolic rate (which will help you lose weight) and you lose the fat that covers the muscle. You're attacking the problem from both sides.\n\n\nUnderstand this - no amount of activity, be it weight lifting, calisthenics, gymnastics, running, aerobics, yoga, swimming, running, martial arts, cycling etc will counteract the effects of eating too many calories.\n\n\nIt's far easier and far quicker to put calories in the tank, than it is to burn them off. In that sense it's just like putting fuel in a car.\n\n\nIf you do know someone who is very active and very lean, it's not because they are active. It's because they eat an appropriate number of calories per day relative to their activity levels.\n\n\nI'll type that again.\n\n\nIt's because they eat an appropriate number of calories per day RELATIVE TO THEIR ACTIVITY LEVELS.\n\n\nAlthough they may require a high volume of training to become good at their sport, they don't then eat 50% or 100% more calories per day than they need.\n\n\nThe swimmer Michael Phelps had body fat measured at 13% for London 2012. For Rio 2016 it was down to 5%.\n\n\nDo you think he achieved that by simply swimming MORE? Or spending MORE time in the gym? No. He's already probably handling as much overall training volume as a human being can cope with.\n\n\nThe drop in body fat would have been due to alterations in his diet, relative to his training workload.\n\n\nYou could look at Olympic gymnasts, and argue that hours of daily training make them lean. But until you've also seen what they eat and drink in terms of both content and portion size, and compared it to what you eat, then you can't simple argue that doing a load of exercise is going to make you lean regardless of diet."], [1, "how sets and reps do you do of each? would love to start doing this!"], [1, "Hollow body holds are just stomach vacuums right?"], [1, "Can we get some supine leg extensions in the mix?

Test yourself so you can better assess for the next time. \nFor your working sets set a time for yourself that's still challenging but that you will recover from so you have energy to hit the rest of your sets with the same intensity.\n\nI'd say 80 to 90%. So If you can hold a plank for 1 minute, make your working set 45 or 50 seconds. \n\nAlso something you could do to up the intensity is a superset. 2 exercises back to back. Super sets are highly effective. So maybe planks superset with side planks. That way you're still getting the benefit of the plank and If you feel like you have more in the tank then you can keep going.\n\nHope that helps !

A question: At 0:28 in the video you are doing dragon flags in a way that is different from what I thought was the way to do them. You seem to have your upper body somehow fixed at an angle and pivoting the leg around the hips, while I thought the way to do them was keeping a fixed hip angle (180\u00b0) and pivoting around the shoulders (like [this](https://youtu.be/h_XzsfPtA8c?t=7m22s)). I am confused. ", "id": "d902c1r"}, {"comment": "So there's not one correct way to do them. You can mix your grip up and get super creative ! You can do them wide armed. Close armed. One armed etc.\n\nYou're right though. The way I did them my hips are the pivot point. This variation with my arms further away from my body is a lot of pulling and requires a good amount of strength in the lats. The further the resistance is away from the fulcrum the harder the exercise is. So having the arms tucked nice and into the body is just not as strong of a pull as further away. For me dragonflags double as an amazing pull exercise along with core. \n\nHow you do it depends on your strength and weaknesses but the goal should definitely be to move the arms further away from the body and then eventually do the exercise with completely straight arms. That's the level I'm trying to get to !", "id": "d90f6zv"}], [{"comment": "Nice video man, really cuts through the bs.

What you want is fat loss rather than weight loss. \n\n\nWeight loss should be discriminant i.e. your body discriminates between fat and muscle, choosing to lose the fat and keep the muscle.\n\n\nBy eating fewer calories per day than you need to maintain your current bodyweight, you send a signal to your body telling it to lose weight.\n\n\nBy resistance training with an appropriate volume, frequency and intensity, you also send another signal to your body telling it that its muscles are going to be placed under stress on a regular basis, and therefore they need to be kept hold of rather than let go.\n\n\nThe result is that you keep your muscle, thus maintaining your resting/basal metabolic rate (which will help you lose weight) and you lose the fat that covers the muscle. You're attacking the problem from both sides.\n\n\nUnderstand this - no amount of activity, be it weight lifting, calisthenics, gymnastics, running, aerobics, yoga, swimming, running, martial arts, cycling etc will counteract the effects of eating too many calories.\n\n\nIt's far easier and far quicker to put calories in the tank, than it is to burn them off. In that sense it's just like putting fuel in a car.\n\n\nIf you do know someone who is very active and very lean, it's not because they are active. It's because they eat an appropriate number of calories per day relative to their activity levels.\n\n\nI'll type that again.\n\n\nIt's because they eat an appropriate number of calories per day RELATIVE TO THEIR ACTIVITY LEVELS.\n\n\nAlthough they may require a high volume of training to become good at their sport, they don't then eat 50% or 100% more calories per day than they need.\n\n\nThe swimmer Michael Phelps had body fat measured at 13% for London 2012. For Rio 2016 it was down to 5%.\n\n\nDo you think he achieved that by simply swimming MORE? Or spending MORE time in the gym? No. He's already probably handling as much overall training volume as a human being can cope with.\n\n\nThe drop in body fat would have been due to alterations in his diet, relative to his training workload.\n\n\nYou could look at Olympic gymnasts, and argue that hours of daily training make them lean. But until you've also seen what they eat and drink in terms of both content and portion size, and compared it to what you eat, then you can't simple argue that doing a load of exercise is going to make you lean regardless of diet.", "id": "d906ivi"}, {"comment": "I agree with 90% of what you're saying. Yes diet plays a huge part and I didn't say it didn't. Of course you have to have a balance that goes without saying. \n\n\nI said \"do these exercises as part of a circuit to burn fat\"\n\nDid you know that HIIT is one of the best ways to burn fat and build muscle simultaneously?\nWe're strength training. Breaking the muscle down so that it repairs and comes back stronger. Go do dragonflags superset with hollow body holds and finish with leg raises. Tell me how you feel. At that point with no rest in between the exercises your body is going metabolic. Your heart rate is elevated and you are in the \"fat burning zone\".\n\nAlso with hiit even after your workout we have something called EPOC. Excess post oxygen consumption. That's where your metabolism is boosted 24-48 hours after your workout forcing you to burn more. \n\nSo yes doing circuit training and super sets is a 100% effective proven way to expend more energy in a shorter time. Expending more energy and even after your workout where you're not doing anything is the goal. Pair that with a good diet and you're making crazy gains. \n\nSo no I'm not contradicting myself at all. And also I'll add the whole point is not to get a 6 pack. I don't train for aesthetics and I'm not encouraging anybody else to. The purpose of this video is to have people build a solid foundation so they can gain strength and have no muscle imbalances.

It's still hard as heck to do and I enjoy doing it, but I just want to make this is normal. Can anyone chime in please?\n\nEDIT: In fact, I'd go as far to say that I feel little to no tension anywhere else, like my shoulders or triceps.

Half start retracted, then end up slightly shrugged at the top, and others keep it retracted all the way. I'm still not fully sure on which one's better than the other.\n\nFor example, in your video, the normal regular pullup, you didn't have a retracted scapula at the top. But during your wide grip pull-ups, it seemed more retracted.\n\n(When I do weighted pull-ups, I have a tendency to not be able to keep my scapula fully retracted all the way)\n\nWhat's your take on this? Thanks and keep it up!", "id": "d143gi0"}, {"comment": "From what I've learned, the general consensus is that retracting your scapula throughout a pull-up is not necessary but optionally beneficial, and more or less necessary depending on the variation. For things like shoulder width and close grip pull ups I personally find retracting my shoulder blades to be counter intuitive to the motion but it goes very naturally through a wide grip motion. The main key form tip is to depress the scapula, rather than retract.\n\nIf you retract through all your pull-ups and you find yourself unable to do so with weighted, you could see that as the fact that your lats and other main muscles are a lot bigger than your shoulder girdle muscles so they will get stronger faster, so it's not a huge problem, or you could see it as your weight is too heavy and you wanna focus on absolute shoulder girdle strengthening. I have a cool pull-up variation I found ages ago that puts pretty extreme emphasis on  shoulder retraction in the pull-up that I posted on my instagram. It's an arched body lower sternum pull-up. Hard to describe but watch here for the difference from a normal pullup:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BCTENtGKEJi/?taken-by=nelorreaga\n\nThe key is to have your shoulders fully retracted and the space under your pecs touching the bar.

The first couple weeks of stretching you will see fast progress cos your body is loosening up again more quickly after having been tight, and your CNS is also learning how to chill out, but after that it is much more of a slow, gradual process.\n\nIf it was due to your stretching 'technique' however, perhaps your breathing was not right. were you holding your breath or stifled at all in the stretches? It is not enough to just hold a stretch, you have to actively breathe into it and relax a bit further each time on the down breath.\n\nUnlikely but you also may have misinterpreted the point of pain with just slightly uncomfortable stretching. Do not push yourself too hard obviously because you can injure yourself, but maybe play around and reevaluate if you maybe thought you were going a bit too gently.\n\nAbove all, 1 month is not enough time to see significant change.

If you cannot get into a position with relaxed muscles (e.g. touching your toes in a sitting pike) you can't even hope to move yourself into that position actively.\n\nBit of a convoluted way of saying it, but this should be done alongside the pike compression recommended in order to improve your pike compression!

Good question. If you take note of the form tips I mention in the standing pike I mention to take care NOT to facilitate the stretch using your lumbar, and isolate the hamstrings by pouring forward at the hips with a neutral spine. In the article you posted they criticise the standing pike by saying it necessarily requires the lumbar to facilitate the stretch but if you do it in the way I describe that is not true. In fact, the 'incorrect' form in my article and the 'damaging' standing pike in the article you shared are the same, but they make no mention of the proper form being damaging. Only that most people try to 'touch their toes' and go into spinal flexion to do that which puts pressure on discs, as I mention in the section about stretching in the morning.\n\nOddly, the exercise that they recommend instead also puts you in a similar degree of lumbar flexion, so I do not see how it is any less damaging in the sense that they say. If you take a look at their desired alternative, the demonstrator is  sitting on their coccyx rather than their 'sit bones' (ischial tuberosity), putting them into posterior pelvic tilt and rounding their lumbar, which is the same degree of spinal flexion that they described to be damaging in the standing pike.\n\nBoth the standing pike, sitting pike, AND their sitting pike modification can be done safely and hazardously for your spine. The important thing to do is to maintain extension in the spine and ensure your lumbar does not flex by 'pouring forward' during the standing pike, or sitting on your ischial tuberosity (sit bones) in order to maintain a degree of APT to pull the hamstrings tight and remove the involvement of the lower back.\n\nIf you are intent on using the stretch they recommend, ensure you do the same thing. If you notice in the images below, in the second image in the gallery I do their recommended stretch as they describe and my spine rounds significantly. However, in the first image when I 'pull' my sitting bones out and sit on them instead of my tailbone and maintain thoracic extension, this keeps my back straight and as you can see I can extend my legs much less, as my lower back is no longer facilitating the stretch. This is the safe way to do any hamstring stretch, including standing.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/r6Sf0\n\nIn any case, the 'safer' hamstring stretch that they prescribe is only semantically different from my suggested sitting pike modification where you wrap a band/towel around your feet and grab onto that in order to prevent spinal flexion to grab your toes.\n\nHope that helps :)", "id": "cz9vmln"}, {"comment": "Amazing, thanks a lot!", "id": "cz9w23b"}]]], "4sjavv": ["12 months of lifting.

I honestly didn't know it was a tough exercise for a lot of people (and I don't say this to brag. My squat is ok, but my bench is god-awful and I can't even do a handstand). The back squat using only one leg is tough, because you either have to lose the counterbalance your arms provide or squat the bar with no hands. It's not bad doing it without hands when you've got both legs; I think I've done about 135-165 with no hands. But one leg? Not happening anytime soon for this guy.\n\nEdit: I feel I should mention that I fenced for 3 years and wrestled for a year. Both sports require a great deal of strength out of your legs. In fencing, we'd hold a lunge for over a minute and do multiple reps of that in a row. When I wrestled, we did A TON of single-leg takedowns which only happen by rapid, powerful lunges. In weight-lifting for wrestling, we did a ton of deadlifts, squats, and lunges.

The back squat using only one leg is tough, because you either have to lose the counterbalance your arms provide or squat the bar with no hands. It's not bad doing it without hands when you've got both legs; I think I've done about 135-165 with no hands. But one leg? Not happening anytime soon for this guy.\n\nEdit: I feel I should mention that I fenced for 3 years and wrestled for a year. Both sports require a great deal of strength out of your legs. In fencing, we'd hold a lunge for over a minute and do multiple reps of that in a row. When I wrestled, we did A TON of single-leg takedowns which only happen by rapid, powerful lunges. In weight-lifting for wrestling, we did a ton of deadlifts, squats, and lunges.

Then, release one hand and reverse its grip, and hold on again. Then flip back. Do this over and over until your stable shoulder is about to let go (you can pause in between grip reverses to load the other shoulder). Then, go to the other shoulder and do a vice versa set.\nThis should re-set the humeral head a little lower against the scapula, and this should relieve any impingement. The last person I advised this to was a woman who had had 18 months of continuous supraspinatus pain. It went away within a day.\nThe exercise is not hard to do, and does not require positioning your shoulder in an impingement zone, and it works for many. The basic exercise is just holding on with one hand while your shoulder is tightly clamped in, and your elbow fully bent.\n\nDon't worry, your trainer, or PT, or doctor, has never heard of this exercise or of me. Don't bother to ask them. Don't bother to google it. Just do it, and if you are like everyone else I recommend this to, it will cure your pain."], [3, "I had this exact thing happen.

Swinging a hammer I've learned is all technique, and those old fuckers who could do it all day liked to see how hard the young guys could work, just to fuck with us.

Using normal pullup grip (palms out), get into the upper position (chin over bar). Then, release one hand and reverse its grip, and hold on again. Then flip back. Do this over and over until your stable shoulder is about to let go (you can pause in between grip reverses to load the other shoulder). Then, go to the other shoulder and do a vice versa set.\nThis should re-set the humeral head a little lower against the scapula, and this should relieve any impingement. The last person I advised this to was a woman who had had 18 months of continuous supraspinatus pain. It went away within a day.\nThe exercise is not hard to do, and does not require positioning your shoulder in an impingement zone, and it works for many. The basic exercise is just holding on with one hand while your shoulder is tightly clamped in, and your elbow fully bent.\n\nDon't worry, your trainer, or PT, or doctor, has never heard of this exercise or of me.

", "id": "d66pfur"}, {"comment": "Hi /u/RxStrengthBob, you are correct on pretty much all counts. It resets the glumeral head while co-contracting all four rc muscles. A huge problem in remediation of the most common rc problem (supraspinatus/subacromial bursitis) is that if the humeral head is not sitting properly to begin with, you can't really make proper progress.   \n  \nI stumbled on this 'cure' by accident. After 3 years of constant pain, I went and began to use a pegboard (an old wrestling training tool). Within 2 weeks, all my pain was gone. When it returned, I could quell it again quite effectively with this 'cure'. I have shown this to many others in person, and it is not a one-size-fits-all, but it does result in total pain relief in most people. \n\nYou do need to do the exercise to near failure to make it work. In people who are quite strong (do weighted pullups), you will need to use weights to make it work. But I've gotten it to work in petite females on a reverse weight pullup machine, too. \n\nTagging /u/nomoreL-sits too.  \n  \nAs to my background, when I had my pain I was working on a research project with the head of a PT department at one of the largest medical schools in the USA (yes I know PT is not a medical dept LOL). In my truest opinion, research on things like this, the biomechanical contributions to repetitive stress injuries, is total crap. In that regard, everyone is full of shit. The funding has simply not been applied to use the scientific method to cure things like rotator cuff RSIs. However, I have taken and taught med school anatomy, been a rotator cuff patient, and achieved pain relief, and I am not looking for anything from anyone who tries my advice except that, if it works for you, pass it on to help others. It is easy. Trying it has almost no risk. As Donald Trump says, \"What have you got to lose?\"  \n  \nI do caution people who have RC pain, though, that an imbalance in back and chest muscles (chest too strong) can make the RC pain come back pretty quickly.

Swinging a hammer I've learned is all technique, and those old fuckers who could do it all day liked to see how hard the young guys could work, just to fuck with us.

Same thing here. You don't make massive gains once but you make many small gains often. The rest is just a journey.\n\nI'm not sure if I phrased that well but y'all get my drift.\n\n> Form is everything\n\nDefinitely this. You said you die a little when people don't warm up. For me it's when I see bad form and expect someone will injure themselves. They're just storing up future pain like money in a bank. When bad luck comes to collect it's with interest and bloody hell does it hurt.\n\nThe number of people, body weight or weights (Although particularly the latter) who seem addicted to numbers is frightening.\n\nLove the post, great points."], [56, "**On time:**\n\n----\n\nIt can certainly take a long, long time for some people to reach certain goals. In the end, it's all about the journey and how much you learn over time. It's also completely OK to not pursue certain goals. You don't HAVE to end up doing every movement. I don't have a place with enough above clearance to regularly attempt to work up to very high pull ups or muscle ups. Instead I focus on lower rep weighted chin ups and dips.\n\nI don't, at this time, care about trying to do a free-standing handstand or free, unsupported headstand/handstand push ups. I'm still getting so much out of wall/pole/street sign supported stuff. I prefer, right now, to just focus on improving and progressing my crow pose/frog stand stuff for hand balancing and I like it that way. I can change it up over the next few years. I've got time.\n\nAfter 1 year and 2 months of training I finally got my first one-arm push ups on each side, but with my legs spread out as far as I could. I've now been training for 1 year and 8 months and, on a really good day, if I go more quickly/explosively I can only manage 5 on each side during my first set, then maybe 4 on my second set. I've slowly been eliminating twisting and bringing my feet closer together. Little changes can drastically increase the difficulty of even basic exercises.\n\nIf I go much, much slower, I can do fewer, but I get far more out of it.\n\nI'm also at most 5'6\" so some of this stuff is a bit easier for me than taller guys. It's still taking me a long time, but that's OK because I thoroughly enjoy the challenge and I actively try to make every exercise harder, even if it's just regular basic push ups, chin ups, pull ups, dips, etc. done with pauses throughout the motion.\n\nJust by bringing my hand placement slowly closer together over time I'm still making my supported headstand push ups very difficult for me, and again, I prefer going slowly.\n\nYou'll get there eventually. It doesn't matter how long it takes. Just do what is most challenging in a safe way and get the most out of what you can do. Stop focusing on what you can't do.\n\n**On form:** \n\n----\n\nI already mentioned slow, controlled movements and how it makes exercises more challenging to me. I prefer doing one-arm push ups slowly, with my feet just about shoulder width apart now. I can at most do 3 this way with a slow cadence, but I can feel it much more in my body so that helps me to perfect my technique even more.\n\nQuality over quantity is what I like and it's definitely been working for me.\n\n**On eating:**\n\n----\n\nDefinitely try to eat well. It's OK to occasionally enjoy fast food because, I mean, it tastes great. A little bit won't kill you. Most of the time it's best to eat a nutritious diet with lots of protein. I don't use supplements. Healthy food can be tasty food, but if you aren't getting enough nutrition you will have difficulty moving ahead, even if it is slower progress.\n\n**On training often:**\n\n----\n\nI generally have two heavy/challenging days a week where I'll use the dip belt for chins and dips and do everything else bodyweight. I usually do one day a week where I go for quality, controlled bodyweight movements to give my 34-year-old ass a little bit more time to recover, but everything I do is difficult.\n\nI also sometimes do a little bit of something every day. I just go lighter and do higher repetitions on those days. Even if it's just some bodyweight dips and pull ups. Just so I'm doing something. It seems to be working for me.\n\n**On goals:**\n\n----\n\nYou may want to do lots of cool stuff starting out. I say pick one thing and focus on that. Then, once you can do that, keep improving it, and then slowly work toward the next goal. If you try to work towards too many goals at once you won't have much success. You need to spend all of your attention mastering one thing at a time. Start with the basics and slowly work your way up based on how you're doing. Take your time. You'll get there eventually.\n\n\nI was already able to do bodyweight dips and pull ups/chin ups when I started out. I then focused on low rep, high weight weighted chin ups and dips for a long time and progressed slowly on other movements. It took me 8 months to get my first wall headstand push up. I worked on that for many more months before I tried doing one-arm push ups. I've found that working on one or two things at once until you get pretty solid on them to work well. I know I wouldn't accomplish jack shit if I went all over the place trying to master more than one or two things at once!\n\n**On continually improving your technique:**\n\n----\n\nYou may not realize this, but you can continue to build upon the basics. Even standard chin ups, pull ups, inverted rows, squats, and push ups can be done in such a way as to make them incredibly difficult by changing incline/decline, tempo/cadence, adding in pauses during the movement, changing hand placement, or doing towel hangs or pull ups/chin ups instead of using the bar.\n\nAt this point, I will still occasionally do basic run of the mill push ups in such a way that I can only knock out so many reps. With bodyweight stuff there is always, always a way to gain more and more from the basics, and yes, even more advanced skills, if you use your brain and experiment."], [18, "I'll be the voice of dissent. A lot of this is conventional wisdom.\n\nAfter you warm-up, you're a little stronger, but that's about the only benefit of warming up. If you're lifting heavy, do a couple lighter reps to make sure you're not injured, but a full warm-up, nah. There's very little evidence that a warm-up prevents injury. All those guys tearing ACLs and Achilles in NFL training camp, right now? They're all warmed up.\n\nIf you want to call actual work, like coordination drills and dynamic stretches a warm-up, fine. But a warm-up for its own sake? One that doesn't involve movements you care to improve or progressively overload or actively maintain. Waste of time. Our lifespans are limited. Time is precious. Don't do cargo cult training. Do work sets.\n\nEating well is ambiguous (recommendations vary hugely) and overrated. No one really knows what it means. Herschel Walker says he eats no protein. Louis Simmons said he had a guy on his team who ate 1200 calories a day or something. I get 30-35% of my calories from Dr. Pepper and the rest is whatever random stuff I think tastes good[1]. I don't get \"enough\" protein, that's for sure. Yet I'm 5'10, 175 lbs of lean muscle, with a high degree of strength, and getting stronger all the time.\n\nIf you're a very particular type of athlete, like a 250 lbs body builder, you may have special dietary needs. You do have to eat to the weight you want to be or need to be for your sport/position. But if you're fine with your weight, you really just need to stronger, and your leanness and athleticism will follow.\n\nYeah, people are different, but energy balance is by far the most important thing you need to worry about with your diet. As long as you maintain energy balance, lots of types of diets will support bodyweight fitness. Don't overeat. But don't feel like you must make it more complex than that.\n\nI'm not just being a contrarian. There's real costs to following conventional wisdom if you don't need to. Warm-ups cost real time that adds up. \"Eating well\", whatever that happens to mean to you, costs time AND will power. If someone thinks there are too many moving parts to making positive change in their life, they often get overwhelmed and fail. I suggest trying eat according to habit and just do work sets. It works for me, it might work for you.\n\n[1] Whether you think this is healthy for longevity is a different issue, and also a fun debate."], [13, "Can you recommend a good warm up routine."], [8, "I haven't trained in about a month due to a combination of laziness, going on vacation, and getting a sinus infection.

In the end, it's all about the journey and how much you learn over time. It's also completely OK to not pursue certain goals. You don't HAVE to end up doing every movement. I don't have a place with enough above clearance to regularly attempt to work up to very high pull ups or muscle ups. Instead I focus on lower rep weighted chin ups and dips.\n\nI don't, at this time, care about trying to do a free-standing handstand or free, unsupported headstand/handstand push ups. I'm still getting so much out of wall/pole/street sign supported stuff. I prefer, right now, to just focus on improving and progressing my crow pose/frog stand stuff for hand balancing and I like it that way. I can change it up over the next few years. I've got time.\n\nAfter 1 year and 2 months of training I finally got my first one-arm push ups on each side, but with my legs spread out as far as I could. I've now been training for 1 year and 8 months and, on a really good day, if I go more quickly/explosively I can only manage 5 on each side during my first set, then maybe 4 on my second set. I've slowly been eliminating twisting and bringing my feet closer together. Little changes can drastically increase the difficulty of even basic exercises.\n\nIf I go much, much slower, I can do fewer, but I get far more out of it.\n\nI'm also at most 5'6\" so some of this stuff is a bit easier for me than taller guys. It's still taking me a long time, but that's OK because I thoroughly enjoy the challenge and I actively try to make every exercise harder, even if it's just regular basic push ups, chin ups, pull ups, dips, etc. done with pauses throughout the motion.\n\nJust by bringing my hand placement slowly closer together over time I'm still making my supported headstand push ups very difficult for me, and again, I prefer going slowly.\n\nYou'll get there eventually. It doesn't matter how long it takes. Just do what is most challenging in a safe way and get the most out of what you can do. Stop focusing on what you can't do.\n\n**On form:** \n\n----\n\nI already mentioned slow, controlled movements and how it makes exercises more challenging to me. I prefer doing one-arm push ups slowly, with my feet just about shoulder width apart now. I can at most do 3 this way with a slow cadence, but I can feel it much more in my body so that helps me to perfect my technique even more.\n\nQuality over quantity is what I like and it's definitely been working for me.\n\n**On eating:**\n\n----\n\nDefinitely try to eat well. It's OK to occasionally enjoy fast food because, I mean, it tastes great. A little bit won't kill you. Most of the time it's best to eat a nutritious diet with lots of protein. I don't use supplements. Healthy food can be tasty food, but if you aren't getting enough nutrition you will have difficulty moving ahead, even if it is slower progress.\n\n**On training often:**\n\n----\n\nI generally have two heavy/challenging days a week where I'll use the dip belt for chins and dips and do everything else bodyweight. I usually do one day a week where I go for quality, controlled bodyweight movements to give my 34-year-old ass a little bit more time to recover, but everything I do is difficult.\n\nI also sometimes do a little bit of something every day. I just go lighter and do higher repetitions on those days. Even if it's just some bodyweight dips and pull ups. Just so I'm doing something. It seems to be working for me.\n\n**On goals:**\n\n----\n\nYou may want to do lots of cool stuff starting out. I say pick one thing and focus on that. Then, once you can do that, keep improving it, and then slowly work toward the next goal. If you try to work towards too many goals at once you won't have much success. You need to spend all of your attention mastering one thing at a time. Start with the basics and slowly work your way up based on how you're doing. Take your time. You'll get there eventually.\n\n\nI was already able to do bodyweight dips and pull ups/chin ups when I started out. I then focused on low rep, high weight weighted chin ups and dips for a long time and progressed slowly on other movements. It took me 8 months to get my first wall headstand push up. I worked on that for many more months before I tried doing one-arm push ups. I've found that working on one or two things at once until you get pretty solid on them to work well. I know I wouldn't accomplish jack shit if I went all over the place trying to master more than one or two things at once!\n\n**On continually improving your technique:**\n\n----\n\nYou may not realize this, but you can continue to build upon the basics. Even standard chin ups, pull ups, inverted rows, squats, and push ups can be done in such a way as to make them incredibly difficult by changing incline/decline, tempo/cadence, adding in pauses during the movement, changing hand placement, or doing towel hangs or pull ups/chin ups instead of using the bar.\n\nAt this point, I will still occasionally do basic run of the mill push ups in such a way that I can only knock out so many reps. With bodyweight stuff there is always, always a way to gain more and more from the basics, and yes, even more advanced skills, if you use your brain and experiment.", "id": "d69lfoz"}, {"comment": "I need to rant and you're a perfect example so thank you and I'm sorry.\n\nOP comes in and gives your half brained run-of-the-mill workout platitudes copy pasta that anyone who has accidentally tripped into an exercise discussion has been divined with,  gives close to no details on how he actually pursued his goals besides the above mentioned and gets roaring applause while the one guy (you) who tries to give a well written, detailed, personal account of what his experience has been gets downvoted.\n\nFuck you guys.\n\nFuck your L-Sits.\n\nFuck your ring dips.\n\nFuck your calorie counts.\n\nFuck erraaythaang!\n\nedit: While I appreciate the effort, y'all don't need to explain to me how reddit's voting algorithm works.

The RR is good, but there are other ways to train with bodyweight that people probably wouldn't know unless they actively sought out information from books, web articles, personal websites of some people, and through Youtube. Most importantly, I tried some things for myself to see if they would work and most of it can work pretty well. The people who know only the RR and only come to this sub are likely skeptical that there are other  ways to go about training with calisthenics.\n\nIt's a good thing that there is no one size fits all approach because training can be more individualized and therefore accessible to anyone based upon their goals and preferences.\n\n", "id": "d6a7gk2"}, {"comment": "The down votes are Reddits anti spam system not actual people.

When \"exploding up\", it's the intent that matters. If the actual movement is slow, that doesn't matter.

If you like the challenge that very slow movement gives to you then you may want to stick with that. You can also mix it up as I do.\n\nI recommend doing what you're most comfortable with, but if you're just starting out perhaps you'd do well to follow the RR for what it is for a while longer before deciding to make any alterations. Whatever you stick with for a long time is going to work.\n\nFor me, when I exercise these days I only care about challenging myself. I stopped worrying about every tiny detail and what is best or most optimal for each circumstance when I stopped lifting weights several years ago. I've found that I could easily discard a bunch of stuff I'd learned over the years and just keep it simple while still making progress. I also accept that progress will be slow if I continually improve my form for quality over quantity. I think ahead in terms of several years and what I will try to accomplish rather than pushing for new goals within months.\n\nIf you've ever read Ross Enamait's stuff (http://rosstraining.com) on his site or in his books you'll understand the keeping it simple and uncomplicated point of view I'm talking about. I also like Al Kavadlo's simpler approach, but I've also learned a lot from reading Pavel Tsatsouline. Of course, I've also learned a lot from this subreddit and from people I know in the real world.\n\nTry some stuff for yourself and continue to read and watch.

A lot of this is conventional wisdom.\n\nAfter you warm-up, you're a little stronger, but that's about the only benefit of warming up. If you're lifting heavy, do a couple lighter reps to make sure you're not injured, but a full warm-up, nah. There's very little evidence that a warm-up prevents injury. All those guys tearing ACLs and Achilles in NFL training camp, right now? They're all warmed up.\n\nIf you want to call actual work, like coordination drills and dynamic stretches a warm-up, fine. But a warm-up for its own sake? One that doesn't involve movements you care to improve or progressively overload or actively maintain. Waste of time. Our lifespans are limited. Time is precious. Don't do cargo cult training. Do work sets.\n\nEating well is ambiguous (recommendations vary hugely) and overrated. No one really knows what it means. Herschel Walker says he eats no protein. Louis Simmons said he had a guy on his team who ate 1200 calories a day or something. I get 30-35% of my calories from Dr. Pepper and the rest is whatever random stuff I think tastes good[1]. I don't get \"enough\" protein, that's for sure. Yet I'm 5'10, 175 lbs of lean muscle, with a high degree of strength, and getting stronger all the time.\n\nIf you're a very particular type of athlete, like a 250 lbs body builder, you may have special dietary needs. You do have to eat to the weight you want to be or need to be for your sport/position. But if you're fine with your weight, you really just need to stronger, and your leanness and athleticism will follow.\n\nYeah, people are different, but energy balance is by far the most important thing you need to worry about with your diet. As long as you maintain energy balance, lots of types of diets will support bodyweight fitness. Don't overeat. But don't feel like you must make it more complex than that.\n\nI'm not just being a contrarian. There's real costs to following conventional wisdom if you don't need to. Warm-ups cost real time that adds up. \"Eating well\", whatever that happens to mean to you, costs time AND will power. If someone thinks there are too many moving parts to making positive change in their life, they often get overwhelmed and fail. I suggest trying eat according to habit and just do work sets.

Otherwise, if they're strong enough and balanced enough to come to parallel from the crown of the head to the lifted heel, they're going to have to bend the knee of the base leg.  A lot of the \"microbend\" cuing comes from teachers trying to cover all their bases and it's a more specific caution for people who are flexible enough to lock out their joints at visually odd, oblique angles, without the strength around the joint to support the stress.  My opinion is that lot of yoga teachers come from a dance or gymnastics background where their flexibility is selected out and then over-emphasized for aesthetics, and often that need to \"microbend\" rather than maxing out the shape every time is an issue that they have to keep themselves aware of.", "id": "d0mhz6b"}, {"comment": "Makes sense.

I'm genuinely trying to understand.", "id": "d0n3pe8"}, {"comment": "My problem is that it's touted as a newbie program because of it's simplicity, but compound lifts aren't simple.  SS and SL came from powerlifting and football weighttraining programs for high schools, where young men are in their prime, uninjured, with the best hormone profile they will ever have, and coached by people with years of experience both in lifting and coaching.  \n\nIt's a SHIT program to throw at oblivious newbies with no coaching or experience who are often much older.  It always was, and always will be.  Sure, it can get people to squat 300lbs in 6 months in some cases, but they will also be injured and fucked up inside of a year in most cases.\n\n---\n\nThe program's recommendations guarantee that people never learn how to do the exercises properly because they will advance in weight too quickly and it's impossible to learn good form at work weight.  The only way they ever learn is if they get coaching or realize the program leaves a lot to be desired and deviate from the program.  In which case the program is a failure.\n\nThis is especially true of newbies:\n\n* They don't know what they're doing\n\n* They have strength and flexibility imbalances\n\n* They have fragile egos, yet deloading and taking time off are left entirely to the newbie's discretion, which is retarded\n\n* They are hungry to \"catch up\" and lift the same kind of weight as others\n\n* There are only two types of newbies, the grudging lifter that doesn't really want to workout, and the gung ho lifter.  Both are dangers to themselves because neither will take the measured approach necessary to learn things properly.\n\n\nCompound lifts are very technical and require proprioceptive practice in order to perform correctly and advance safely, ESPECIALLY if you have any imbalances which complicate the issue tremendously.  Yet these programs recommend doing nearly all of your reps at working weight, which is just not how you learn good form in a compound lift.  \n\nWorking at 85% of your 1RM or whatever recommendation they use simply puts too much stress on your body for you to make the small adjustments necessary to improve your form, often correcting your form significantly decreases the amount of weight you can handle and that can't be done when you're so near your limit.  After two sets it takes all of your effort and focus just to finish out the remaining sets, there's nothing left to be spent correcting form.\n\n---\n\n\n\n>Or people that don't spend the time to learn to do an exercise properly? \n\nAnd this goes to show you don't understand.  Learning to do an exercise properly is not a trivial thing.  You can't spend 10 minutes on the internet watching a video and a half hour in the gym and expect to master a complex multi-joint movement to the point that you can safely do it with hundreds of pounds.  It takes many hours of practice and hundreds, even thousands of thoughtfully performed reps.  And it's not something that even occurs to most people, the difference between good form and bad form is very subtle to the inexperienced eye.\n\n\n", "id": "d0n47rg"}, {"comment": "I guess my copy of Starting Strength discussed those things a little differently than yours. Have a good day anyway.", "id": "d0n4hdj"}, {"comment": "it took me 2 months to not be able to add weight anymore. i get your point, and it's a valid one, but i feel that in those two months i learned a LOT. Enough to be able to lift safely. But its very important to constantly evaluate form, ask the pro's and get form checks. i think that form is something you never master, but something one should constantly work on throghout their lifting career. I think stronglifts is good. But i also think that everyone should be very aware of the dangers of ego lifting and bad form. and i can see that the stronglift program without the neccesary research and commitment can fuck you up if you're not careful. \n(sry for bad english. norwegian on mobile)\n", "id": "d4sx4f6"}, {"comment": "Yes, you have to stay vigilant on the form and not do the classic newbie mistake of always trying to set PRs.  That's a definite path to serious acute injury.  Muscle tears and tendon detachment are the common ones and once you've had one of those injuries it never fully goes away, it's always a weak point.\n\nThe more insidious trouble with poor form and newbie lifters is often the damage they're causing doesn't present itself immediately, any immediate symptoms are very mild until they've trained through it for weeks or months or years and it develops into a life-changing problem.  The initial symptoms typically present as stuff like tightness in the joints or tendon inflammation, but both are signs of overspecialization in your lifting program and imbalance in your exercise choices.   Tendonitis usually follows repeated high tension stress, high volume plyometric movements and pushing your volume on heavy weights are usually the causes.  Joint problems usually come from muscle imbalances, which are incredibly hard to detect and correct without tons of experience, the average physical therapist that studies this stuff for years in school often fails to properly diagnose imbalances from lifting, a newbie lifter has essentially zero chance to solve it on their own.\n\nSomeone who's 20 years old has never experienced the damage you can cause with repetitive straining movements over years, they simply haven't had the time to cause that damage, the only time they had to do it was when they were a kid and their recovery capacity was through the roof (and their strength was much lower, preventing them from outlifting their joints) so anything they did that could have caused problems was mitigated by their youth, although they will probably see signs later.  Knees and wrists are common ones to have problems with later if kids absorb a lot of heavy impacts through those joints such as from running, kicking, jumping on hard surfaces, punching, gymnastics, etc.\n\nWalk into any gym and anyone there that's lifting at least mid-tier weight and has a couple years of lifting experience will have some of these problems.  Fucked up backs, shoulders, knees, and wrists, nearly all serious lifters have at least one wrong with them, most have more than one issue, and quite a few experience all of them.  It's the muscle imbalances and repetitive damage to the tendons and ligaments that eventually catch up to you, but it typically won't be until at least 6 months down the line for newbie lifters that those issues start to get worryingly painful.  \n\nThe thing about connective tissues is they don't have a lot of nerves and they get very minimal bloodflow, they are quite resilient, but they heal very slowly, at roughly 1/10th the pace of muscle tissue with it's incredibly high bloodflow.  Damage to connective tissue happens over a timeframe extended an order of magnitude over that of muscles, and people simply fail to make the connections between the problem and the causes because the delay between them is too long for them to see the pattern.  This goes double for young lifters, they simply don't have experience problem solving over that timeframe, making it even harder for them to comprehend that things they've been doing for months without experiencing any serious issue are the cause of their apparently sudden (although in truth it built up over the course of months) injury when their body finally gives up on compensating for the punishment they're subjecting it to.\n\nJust keep in mind things have far reaching consequences, probably much farther reaching than you think if you're young.  It's best to plan a lifting career to hit your goals 10 years down the line, not 2 years or even 5 years.  Take it slow and cycling in periods of maintenance and periods of higher effort and higher progress seems to be the best strategy from my experience.  That is if you actually want to still be lifting in 10 years rather than unable to squat, unable to bench, unable to deadlift, due to pain like many lifters in their 30s and 40s.", "id": "d4t2ote"}, {"comment": "strong lift didn't advocate form enough to get it into my head, and now I am broken. \n\nEdit :removed childish outburst ", "id": "d0n3lsv"}, {"comment": "I'm not going to report you.

You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.\n\nPush-ups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps.

You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.\n\nPush-ups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps.

And don't forget your cardiovascular work!\n\nI'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers!

Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).\n\nAnd don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym.

You have to also remember that on a daily basis, these are muscles you don't really utilize particularly if like me, you have an office job.  \n\nMy advice is skip the chin ups. Many of the exercises that are mainstream, utilize biceps as a secondary muscle so you aren't missing much if you take them out of this exercise.  I bought a pull up bar specifically to enable me to learn pull ups. Again, this goes back to what you are looking to accomplish but as the difficulty of a pull up is generally higher for most body types, I'd say focus on doing them over chin ups or at least keep them in the mix as the ease of each motion is typically not equal.

For example, one might have access to more gear and wonder if the recommended routine is the best routine even without the restrictions on expensive gear, or one might have very specific strengths and weaknesses from previous exercise (for example a climber might complete the pullup and row progressions with ease but struggle with v-sits).

For example, with back lever it's unwise to jump straight into back lever. It's more important to realize that the RR recommendation of skin the cat/german hang, support holds, positional drills, and pullups and rows is building a foundation of strength and connective tissue integrity and positioning in order to prepare you for back lever. Most new people do not recognize why many of the exercises are programmed the way they are for higher level goals.\n\nIn this respect, your analogy does not fit the RR as the RR takes into account preparation in the long run for more advanced movements. It can be the case that modifications toward the goals of higher level movements right away may lead someone to more likely be at risk for overuse injuries.\n\nIf you're interested in thoughtful discussion of why I said the things I did I am certainly willing to do so.

I will be attending DPT school this year and am really excited!

For instance, when I said \"shouldn't I also do rows?\", he said \"Not really unless you are training for an activity that rows are very applicable, or if you want huge rhomboids (jokingly).\"\n\nSo, he basically says that all that really needs to be done are squats, pull-ups, and push-ups, since together, they cover pretty much all muscles. When I asked about planks, he said that your core is being worked in all those exercises, so you don't really need to do planks in addition to these. \n\nNow, perhaps he is making more of a general recommendation for the public, as doing these 3 exercises would already be more than the average population does when it comes to exercise. \n\nHe was also citing some longitudinal Japanese study that supported this...\n\nAnyways, what are your opinions on his response when I asked asked him about the routine I do? Why, biomechanically, is it important to do both vertical/horizontal push/pull rather than focusing more on the muscles being used (although I do understand that these correlate more often than not). I look forward to your response, as I always enjoy learning from people's responses and opinions!", "id": "cz6telc"}, {"comment": "> So, he basically claimed that the beginner routine is too hung up on the direction of exercises (eg vertical/horizontal push/pull) and that I should focus more on what muscles are being used for these exercises.\n\n>As such, he explained that doing push-ups and dips are redundant, as are pull-ups and rows, since they both work the same muscles (albeit some to a more or less extent).

When I asked about planks, he said that your core is being worked in all those exercises, so you don't really need to do planks in addition to these.\n\nA good question. There's a lot of things that come into play here.\n\nIt seems as if he's just speaking from the context of hypertrophy. In that respect, he is correct to some extent. For example, pullups and rows pretty much do hit the exact same muscles and could be considered redundant in a few ways. However, this is just speaking from the aspect of hypertrophy.\n\nIf we're talking about the aspect of strength, we know that the equation for strength = neurological factors * cross sectional area of muscle (hypertrophy). In terms of strength, hypertrophy is part of the equation; however, neurological factors make up a significant part of the equation as does practice of the specific movements (e.g. you may have heard of the phrase \"strength is a skill\"). Hence, specific training with pullups does not necessarily improve specific strength for rows.\n\nThe reason for both pullups and rows is not that they just hit the muscles of the back a bit differently but they also prepare you for other things. For example, muscle ups require a pullup, transition, and a dip. Most people are familiar with training for pullups and dips, but what most people do not realize unless they've trained or coached muscle ups specifically is that the transition portion of the muscle up requires a strong rowing of the elbows back much like the top position of the inverted row. Hence, there is specific reasoning for rows aside from general improvement of posture and scapular retraction benefits as well.\n\nAdditionally, Doing zillions of pushups, weighted pushups, or even bench press does not prepare your body for the demands of a dip either. Different movement patterns are able to stimulate different effects just as different variations of pushups may emphasize different areas.\n\nOverall, were not talking about \"just working the muscles\" or say \"just hypertrophy\" in terms of the RR. We're talking about strength, hypertrophy, mobility, flexibility, overall learning basic fundamental movement patterns, and a lot of other various factors that go into a routine.\n\nHope that helps.", "id": "cz6vddd"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the response, it makes a lot of sense. \n\nSo basically, you may be working all the muscles with these exercises, but the strengthening of these muscles don't directly translate to the actual functional movements if they are not practiced. So, for hypertrophy, just doing these 3 exercises may be sufficient. But doing exercises in all directions would help you perform more exercises because you will have \"practiced\" most of the movements required. (Just making sure I understood correctly)\n\nSo, why does the RR not have pike push-ups or something for vertical push in the upward direction? Or are the isometrics involved in handstands sufficient?\n\nThanks again!\n\nEDIT: On a side note, would you be comfortable recommending only squats, pull-ups, and push-ups to somebody only interested in hypertrophy? \n\nEDIT 2: After thinking about it a little more, don't neurological enhancements occur due to increasing the frequency of neurological signals to the muscles? So as long as neurons are firing to those muscles (muscles are being worked), those neurological benefits would still be acquired, regardless of the direction of the exercise being performed?

(Just making sure I understood correctly)\n\n>On a side note, would you be comfortable recommending only squats, pull-ups, and push-ups to somebody only interested in hypertrophy?\n\nPart of it, yes. Simplifying the amount of exercises down to a certain point produces limited results when training different attributes. Even most hypertrophy oriented routines such as bodybuilder routines may have variations of biceps curls for example. So, no.\n\n>So, why does the RR not have pike push-ups or something for vertical push in the upward direction? Or are the isometrics involved in handstands sufficient?\n\nThe main issue with adding in another exercise either push or pull (for the RR this would be a handstand pushup progression mainly) is the increased risk of overuse injuries due to the increase of volume. Namely, typically if you add in another push exercise it would be wise to balance it out with a pull and thus there would be two additional exercises which increases chances for overuse injuries in beginners because they are not used to higher volumes of exercise.\n\nIn general, the work with handstands as skill/strength work is enough to start getting used to the handstand, and dips serve as a brute pushing exercise in order to develop muscle mass. Hence, when the time comes you can switch out dips for handstand pushups later.\n\n>After thinking about it a little more, don't neurological enhancements occur due to increasing the frequency of neurological signals to the muscles?

Although I do still see how the motion would apply to motion, flexibility, and movement patterns. Thanks again!\n\nNo, Rate coding/firing rate is only one neurological adaptation. Others include:\n\n* Motor recruitment -- not all fibers in a muscle fire at the same time. As you train you can recruit more units.\n* Synchronization / intra-muscular coordination -- think tug of war. If all of the units pull at the same time you generate more force than if they pull randomly\n* Contribution / Inter-muscular coordination -- think pullups... biceps, lats and other muscles need to work in coordination with each other to execute the movement properly\n* Motor learning -- practicing = learning a skill = performing it better\n* Various inhibition cycles such as demodulating golgi tendon organs, reciprocal inhibition, etc. -- increase force development\n\nSome of these are learned patterns. You're correct that rate coding with an exercise may apply broadly to other exercises. However, some are specific such as contribution and motor learning to the specific exercise you are practicing. Hence, someone who does different types of bench press or different types of deadlifts may be much less strong on one exercise than the other even though they are variations.\n\nAlso, it's unlikely that they will teach you this in PT school if you were wondering.

If your routine isn't enjoyable then definitely change something otherwise you're not likely to stick with it. On the other hand, if your workouts change wildly from session to session purely to seek enjoyment then you're not likely to see much progress.\n\nSo, it's probably best to have a few basic strength building exercises which you can progress over time and will help you achieve your goals and then also have a another part of the workout where you can improvise if you wish. This is sort of the thinking behind the skill work and strength work in the RR. \n\nFor example, you might have deadlifts, pull-ups, dips and sit-ups as your strength builders and then once these are done you can focus on whatever skills or movements you wish.\n\nI think another thing that needs to be mentioned is that I don't think some beginners realise just how much strength (both muscular and connective tissue) is required for certain bodyweight skills (planches, front lever, iron cross etc).

If doing everything listed feels like too much, it probably is for you. Either your body isn't ready or your mind isn't and most likely you need to train both before you will be ready to make it a regular part of your routine.\n\nHonestly, no workout plan worked for me until I became determined to *something* every day that resembled exercise. At first, that sometimes meant I was only doing two pushups before quitting; not because I was unable to do more pushups but rather because I didn't *feel* like doing more. But I still made myself get down on the floor and do something every day and those were the tiny victories that kept piling up until I won the war with my mind. Overcoming my inability to stick with workout plans long-term was my greatest obstacle...once I had killed it with death by a thousand cuts (or, in this case, a thousand pitiful exercises), I realized I actually craved exercise and that my workouts were naturally getting longer as it felt better and better to do them.\n\nThe point is, no one workout plan is going to change your life-- it's about changing your mentality permanently using baby steps if that's what it takes. If you can do that, your body will follow suit. So, yeah, just get in there and do 1/3rd if that's what makes you feel good about doing it and, more importantly, gets you to come back and finish later. As long as you're not injuring yourself, what or how much you do doesn't matter much in the beginning.

It comes down to 2 major factors: exposure and dose. Firstly there are 3 types of omega 3s that our bodies require: alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)  and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is the most 'basic' omega 3 and can be converted to EPA and DHA. Cold-water fish sources such as salmon are high in EPA and DHA. Plant sources of omega 3 are almost exclusively ALA. So although you may think that that if you consume solely plant based omega 3 (ALA) you would be covered with regards to EPA and DHA this is not the case. ALA conversion rates to EPA and DHA in humans is less than 5 and 1% respectively. So a combination of plant and fish based diet is essential for a more complete omega 3 intake. Now back to exposure and dose. As is true for all nutrients, it is better to 'spread out' (i.e. boost exposure) the intake over the course of the day to accommodate common limitations such as absorption, bio-availability, tissue penetration, cellular uptake, enzymatic activity and others. These limitations reduce the body's ability to effectively utilize nutrients we ingest. Plant based omega 3 (ALA) is much more ubiquitous in foods and also present in several-fold higher levels than fish based omega 3s (EPA and DHA), mass to mass. Thus, ALA exposure and dose is generally not an issue given a complete and wholesome diet. To match or approach the level of EPA and DHA exposure and dose with that of ALA's, one would have to consume fish throughout the day which is less than ideal and difficult to do. So although including a fish-based meal during the day may provide a few grams of combined EPA and DHA, you are taking in your daily requirement in one sitting and in one large dose. Taking omega 3 supplements (fish based or specifically EPA/DHA supplements) allows you to not only increase the dose of these limited fatty acids, but it allows for a more consistent exposure throughout the day.\"\n", "id": "d1snnus"}, {"comment": "Oh okay.

It\u2019s a headline to garner attention, not a synopsis of what the paper actually says:\n\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_rele\u2026/2016-07/mu-lwj071216.php\n\nThe issues:\n\nFirst of all, high reps versus low reps. Brings to mind singles, doubles, and triples versus 10s and 12s. But in actuality 8-12 repetitions is considered low reps in the paper and 20-25 reps is high repetitions. So the paper actually looked at high reps versus even higher reps. So, we really cannot make any conclusions on high versus low reps with this paper.\n\nSecond, they used three machine based exercises (leg press, knee extension, and press) and one barbell exercise (bench press) as tests. The machine based exercises responded the same in both 8-12 and 20-25 set configurations. The barbell based exercise produced the best strength results with 8-12 reps per set. Hmmm. Machine based vs barbell based interventions seem to produce a different outcome (as anyone with time in the gym will have already noted). Again we can\u2019t really make strong conclusions based on these data.\n\nThird, they gave each group immediate post workout protein supplements which may have masked any biochemical responses that might have been seen in a normal, not supplemented trainee. The biochemical data may not be useful.\n\nFourth, the subject\u2019s performance levels, capable of benching 98 kg (216 lbs) would normally just be considered to have completed the beginner\u2019s level of training (http://lonkilgore.com/freebies/BSQSTDS-Metric.pdf). The subjects had been training with weights for an average of 4 years for between 3 and 6 sessions per week, meaning that their previous training had not produced significant progress at a normally seen rate of progression (or at the rate the subjects increased their bench press in this paper, by an average of 11 kg in the twelve week study - that\u2019s 44kg per year \u2013 do a backwards calculation on this to see how it takes to get to zero). The inclusion criteria also included requiring the use of a split routine. So again, we need to be cautious about inferring any data from the paper to any group outside of those included as subjects in this paper.\n\nThe good thing here is that higher repetitions, 8-12 and 20-25, both induced an increase in lean mass (excluding fat and bone) of 0.8 kg (1.76 lbs) in 12 weeks. That\u2019s good BUT would that have happened IF there had been no post workout protein supplementation? The paper cannot make that determination.\n\nThe bottom line is that trainers need to read the original paper (linked in the news article) in detail and then use their knowledge and experience to put the findings into context \u2026 and then put that information into practice if the data is strong enough to warrant it\"", "id": "d5cxvu0"}, {"comment": "> The good thing here is that higher repetitions, 8-12 and 20-25, both induced an increase in lean mass (excluding fat and bone) of 0.8 kg (1.76 lbs) in 12 weeks.

START THERE, even if it's just for the first few workouts. A level of an exercise may feel too easy after one repetition, but after 3 reps it may be just the level of push you need. Speaking of which...\n\nDon't work out to exhaust yourself every time. Something I've found has an immense effect on my mental health is being realistic. For example, on up days when my depression isn't acting up as much, I may think \"Oh my god I can do so many things! I'm gonna do x and y and change my whole life.\" Then, when I can't live up to that I lose hope and get depressed. \n\nThat's just what's helped me the most. I've only been doing 1-2 days a week but letting myself ease into it has helped me really enjoy the workouts without putting tons of pressure on myself.

It is the best, most amazing pain you will ever feel, because while it hurts, it hurts GOOD. Read the FAQ again. Find out how you're going to hit your goals (want to lose weight and build muscle? The answer is in the FAQ).\n\nLook up the rank beginner routine. Check out the videos on how to do all those exercises. Not too complicated, right? Go to bed.\n\nDay 3. Do your exercises. You're still sore, your body says \"fuck you, I don't want to do this\" you say \"no, Fuck you. You are doing this. I'm in charge now\" and do your routine. It will be horrible. It will be embarrassing. And in a way it will be amazing.\n\nNow fix your diet. Eat according to the FAQ. Losing weight, eat fewer calories. Did you mess up and eat half a cake? Welcome to being human. Now, the OLD you takes that mistake and says \"I screwed up, might as well give up\", but the new you says \"fuck that, I'll do better\" and your self control improves little by little.\n\nKeep doing your routine. If you say to yourself \"I really don't want to do my routine today\" that means that you need to work out RIGHT NOW. Soon you'll look forward to it.\n\nI'm telling you this because I was in a very similar situation a few months ago, and now that I've started exercising, my attitude is 100% better. It only gets easier, the first one is the hardest.\n\nGood luck. Let us know how it goes.", "id": "d8fwa7c"}, {"comment": "Best answer.

START THERE, even if it's just for the first few workouts. A level of an exercise may feel too easy after one repetition, but after 3 reps it may be just the level of push you need. Speaking of which...\n\nDon't work out to exhaust yourself every time. Something I've found has an immense effect on my mental health is being realistic. For example, on up days when my depression isn't acting up as much, I may think \"Oh my god I can do so many things! I'm gonna do x and y and change my whole life.\" Then, when I can't live up to that I lose hope and get depressed. \n\nThat's just what's helped me the most. I've only been doing 1-2 days a week but letting myself ease into it has helped me really enjoy the workouts without putting tons of pressure on myself.

The only aim is to get out of breath no matter how short amount of time that takes. We spend most of our life avoiding getting to that uncomfortable point,  once you're over that hurdle and can sustain a minute or two of high energy activity you can start to do exercises if you like.\n\nThen do 1 exercise per minute - you can easily do lots of exercises that don't need any equipment - jumping jacks, burpees, punches, squats, lunges, sit-ups, wall-sit, high knees, plank. \n\nBuild it up slowly so you maybe do 3, 5, 15, 20 and eventually 30 mins in a row. You can get an exceptional work out in just 20-30 mins of activity.

I suppose you could possibly damage the wrists if you simply slump into the joint with no bracing through the forearm, or tension through to the shoulder, but if a person's strength and body awareness is at that low a level, I have a hard time believing that they'd be likely to practice this often enough to do real damage.  Do you have anything to back that up?  I'd had enough wrist pain from my 20s to my 40s that I did push ups on my knuckles for 15 years, probably 5 times a week.  No adverse consequences.  Once I started practicing yoga, I started looking into wrist stretching and mobility and within a couple of years I could flatten my hands with no pain.  I practice handstands daily.  There's nothing wrong with using grips or wedges, but the knuckle push-up stuff is way off base.  Hell, if you read the description in the wikipedia link in the comment, what they're describing is the same configuration you'd use for doing push-ups on your fist, with the wrist held in line with the forearm and the palm perpendicular with the ground, but instead of pressing into the knuckles at the base of your fingers, you'd be pressing into the next higher set of knuckles of the middle fingers.", "id": "d6g91qn"}, {"comment": "> I'd had enough wrist pain from my 20s to my 40s that I did push ups on my knuckles for 15 years, probably 5 times a week.\n\nI'm in the same boat.

The ones in Antranik's video, linked above, are great, and I've done them all and a whole bunch of other variations I've come across.  My go-to stretches have been less dynamic and more like isometric holds:  1)On all 4's, palms down, fingers rotated in toward the knees, gripping the floor with the fingertips all the while. 2)Same thing but palms up, definitely more intense, trying to grip with the back of the hand. 3)Four fingers curled into palms, thumbs curled outside fingers, knuckles to the floor like you're punching down, then bending one wrist at a time, maintaining the fist while bringing the back of the hand to the floor.  A minute for the first two holds, probably 25 rounds side-to-side of the third stretch.  [15 second IG demo here](https://www.instagram.com/p/93586MTRXa/) .  After a year of wrist stretching every day, I added straight arm hangs and I'm convinced that helped, but it's impossible to say for sure.  After two years, my wrist pain was gone completely.  That's two years, though.  It was gradual. I still stretch the wrists every day.

My understanding is that she teaches a bit more of a free-form movement style now, but she's got this \"Yoga and Movement Research Community\" on Facebook.  It started with her critiquing the typical yoga cue to \"soften your glutes\" -- which goes directly to her injury, where she actually detached her hamstrings from her pelvis after years of practice -- but there's lots of discussion about all sorts of cuing and practices that people just sort of accept as tradition or whatever in yoga.  She has a video relevant to this thread, about what she calls [\"The Natural Hand\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_BI4lWNBC0) position, that addresses what you're talking about when you're pressing down on the index knuckle.

", "id": "d6gwro6"}, {"comment": "Yeah, I'm not completely sold on what she says as a \"method\" per se, but I think it's an interesting reaction to the usual yoga cuing for hand position.  I don't think there is an ideal, one-size-fits-all hand configuration for bearing weight on the hands. I'm skeptical when people, especially in yoga, start pushing some new \"perfect way\" for body position or alignment or movement, and then get hyper-technical and overly exact about someone else's positioning.  If I'm in down dog, I have no trouble at all with the hand position in the drawing that u/yangYing linked to.  I don't have any trouble with what Bruni describes either, but I've seen lots of people in my classes that have trouble with one or the other.  There's a massive amount of variability in the structure and proportions of people's hands, that I hadn't appreciated before I started teaching yoga and really had to look at what other people were doing and why.  I don't have a solid answer to what's best and I'm skeptical of people who do.  There are TONS of people who have trouble with any sort of \"active hands\" idea, who'll press their fingertips or the base of their thumbs into the floor, but once you tell them to straighten their legs or think of some other area of the body, will release all of the tension in their hands and you'll see this thing where the palm cups and the weight rolls to the outside edges of the palms.  I think it's much more important to train yourself to hold on to muscle engagement and tension, in the hands especially, when you need it for a specific position or move, and learn to modulate the intensity, rather than have it as more of an on/off binary thing.  There could be a hand position that damages you gradually, over time, but there's no real way to know that definitively for a particular person -- even after the fact, you're hypothesizing.  I can shift the weight all around my hand without much problem.  I don't really worry about TFCC trauma or anything like that, not to say that it isn't possible -- I'd worry more if I was doing abrupt impact movements, explosive tricking or breakdancing or whatever -- I just make sure I work my hands and wrists through a range of different positions and levels of tension every day.", "id": "d6hwv4n"}, {"comment": "Then back off..

Remembering how I weeded through routines until I found y'alls, I think it might be great to have that video segue into a 2-3 minute demo of the entire routine focusing on fundamental form and briefly describing how to interpret typical beginners body feedbacks as you begin.  I almost stopped too long because I was experiencing too much joint cracking until I dug around in here and found that it was typical and usually goes away, but isn't a major red flag anyway.  And then perhaps a third video building on that, explaining more advanced details, like body mechanics, that are useful to focus on in preperation for more advanced variations or end-goals.  My biggest issue with videos on this sub so far is that they spend 8+ minutes on 1-3 excercises for beginning routines and isn't really practical to use as a refresher during my short work out hour (My brain shuts down when I'm working out and my recall is horrible=/ ).

Once you get the 3x8 of something, you can start with a higher progression in that category during your next workout.\n\n\nSo with push-ups, let's say you can do 3x8 regular push-ups already. Then you would only work on diamond push-ups for the push-up category in your next workout until you hit 3x8. That could take several weeks or months of diamond push-ups in your workout.
