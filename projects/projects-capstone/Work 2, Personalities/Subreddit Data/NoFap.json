So what do you see all over Western supermarkets? Sugar things (children cereals, candy, cakes, soft drinks, etc). You are enticed from the time you enter the supermarket until you leave to buy this crap.\n\nAnd this applies to other substances like Cigarettes, Alcohol (in Europe at least), and so on.\n\nThe Corporations have done something really incredible: They have kept legal the most dangerous drugs, and sell them at millions of profits each each, largely passing in profit amount the illegal kind of drugs (cocaine, heroin, etc). \n\nPorn in itself is the most fcked up industry of all, because it gets you addicted in the absolute pleasure (orgasm). It's like you continuously inject yourself with the most potent drug. \nI know, I was addicted (not to porn, but jerking off), due to being in a stressful situation . Like all drugs, they are tempting when you are down, not when you are up (hence why the majority of addicts are not extremely successful people or wealthy people).\nOf course the system in itself is not necessarily evil. I am not saying that. Its just a system of economics. Supply & Demand. The problem is that the DEMAND is fuelled by addictions not a healthy demand, but the suppliers obviously are happy. Look if many people want to buy your product, is that evil to sell it? No. You are just making money.\n\nThis is why I believe the government should step in. \nFor example putting up advertising about sugar and porn, the same way they put huge pictures of disfigured babies in public transportation and so on, to discourage smoking.\nOutlawing honestly might help too. I was against outlawing before, but now I realize my stupidity after being on nofap noporn for quite some time.\nYes there will always be a black market.

However many people become obsessed to a detrimental degree, perhaps by outside pressures and expectations.\n\nWith a failure, you can learn and improve. If you spend too much of your time focusing on your failure, perhaps even punishing yourself, then you are not improving as effectively. A failure should be acknowledged for the knowledge it can impart, but dwelling is only self-defeating.\n\nTo complete the thought, success should be something encouraging and used to learn what you did correctly so that you can continue to do that. People can spend too much time dwelling on their past successes rather than being productive and creating new ones, improving themselves continually.\n\nAny outcome is useful and can be used to improve yourself, but the effort needs to be made, otherwise valuable opportunities to learn are wasted. The only metric that should matter is your own relative success, \"Are you improving on yourself today to be better tomorrow?\" If that's true,  then wherever you are in life relative to other people or you own goals is not important, dwelling on your own perceived shortcomings are a hindrance and are not useful for self-improvement.\n\nIf you ask me, as human beings, self-improvement is a moral obligation. Anything you do which hampers your progress has no place.\n\nNow we're all human, we're not perfect, we shouldn't be expected to be perfect, humans are admirable for their efforts, success is fleeting and don't tell a man's story or values. The efforts that we put in because we are imperfect are what count most.\n\nSorry, got on a soap box, for me more than anything.

Progress never leads to the happiness you are looking for because there is no end to progress; therefore you're seeking, your search always continues.

Happiness is to be achieved Now; not in the future, because there is no future. There is noone to move into the future. Nor is there anyone that has arrived from the past. Yesterday, today, was Now. Today, tomorrow, is Now. The annihilation of progress is Now. The continuation of achieving greater and greater successes through progress is an illusory accomplishment bringing you fake happiness; always you will feel as if you've been cheated because your happiness depends on external conditions. Have I achieved this thing? Have I accomplished that thing? Have I earned my right to be happy through enough of my suffering? All these things are excuses to be self-destructive, because love cannot coexist with fear, and fear is the true place from which many of the efforts to be improved comes. If I am in love, especially with my self, I do as I do not because I am seeking to improve myself, but because I cannot do otherwise. If there is someone to be improved, let him let go of his desire to be improved and find out what in himself he truly likes. Doing what you love you forget time altogether. Where there is no regard for time how can there be progress? Ah we see: going beyond time, going beyond progress, only here joy is.

Happiness is to be achieved Now; not in the future, because there is no future. There is noone to move into the future. Nor is there anyone that has arrived from the past. Yesterday, today, was Now. Today, tomorrow, is Now. The annihilation of progress is Now. The continuation of achieving greater and greater successes through progress is an illusory accomplishment bringing you fake happiness; always you will feel as if you've been cheated because your happiness depends on external conditions. Have I achieved this thing? Have I accomplished that thing? Have I earned my right to be happy through enough of my suffering? All these things are excuses to be self-destructive, because love cannot coexist with fear, and fear is the true place from which many of the efforts to be improved comes. If I am in love, especially with my self, I do as I do not because I am seeking to improve myself, but because I cannot do otherwise. If there is someone to be improved, let him let go of his desire to be improved and find out what in himself he truly likes. Doing what you love you forget time altogether.

It also means taking care of your duties (even if they are just to yourself - like taking care of your health, mental and physical). And why do you need to spend a significant portion of your life (40 hours/week is significant enough for me) making money? Because that is how you support your life. You need to make money to feed, cloth and shelter yourself. You also need money to pursue your hobbies and interests such as video games.

You're a loser with no life. Look at me, I'm so cool. I'm a hyperproductive superman who never takes any rest or relaxation.\"\n\nRealize life isn't all about productivity, money, or long term gain. It's about fun, short term gains, and enjoying life too. You can't just gogogogogogogo and be productive 100% of the time. I've tried it, I burned out and hit lows that I don't think I would've ever hit otherwise. That is however just my life view, if yours is different more power to you but don't impose upon others. \n\nI believe that your view on video games and gaming in general has been poisoned by personal feelings against it. Maybe you had a gaming addiction and the only way to get to even start to getting rid of it is to demonize the entire thing. However other people don't have the exact same problems as you do. You have to take that into consideration when posting here. Not everyone is a gaming addict. What defines a gaming addict anyways? Spending more than two hours playing games daily? Some days I do and some days I don't play at all. Am I an addict? I don't think so. As a kid I used to play a lot of video games, 8-10 hours daily. I was kid, no responsibilities, with nothing else to do. Things change though. I do admit that if you're 18+ and you're still doing that you have a problem. Maybe occasionally on the odd weekend you do nothing but play video games for one day, I think that's ok. As long as it's not every day.\n\nAll I'm saying is video games aren't the devil, they're not out to prevent you from being a productive member of society and they're not designed to lock you into your chair or on your couch and make you do nothing but play them. If you're like that it's your own fault, not the video games. Secondly when posting here if you really want people to listen and not just ignore everything you're saying because you sound like an asshole who thinks he's better than everyone else, try actually empathizing with them and not just spouting your hate for a hobby beloved by millions. You might have had a problem with video games, we all share the problem with at least one addiction here. PMO. I suffer from it and I'm assuming you do too since you're here.

That's helped immensely, and after tomorrow I'll have gone the longest time without fapping since I started nofap in late April.  \n\nEDIT also would like to chime in with this song/music video, never fails to get me pumped up and I feel like it easily could have been inspired by not fapping https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1-xRk6llh4", "id": "d4r7mjd"}, {"comment": "Great post dude, I agree completely.

Secondly, you have to observe any physical manifestation of the addiction. That being said, observe the physical manifestation (be it erections, rising body temperature, etc.) and while observing, affirm that its good, innocent, and natural, and that you don't want it to go away and that you are OK with it.

Even more than a couple might be overwhelming for someone who is otherwise pretty deep into the throes of their routines. \n\nNoFap is, I think, a really good introduction to this stuff because it's fairly easy to compartmentalize and it is more intimate/personal. The hope, with NoFap, I think, is that it shows you the template for how to do this with other things in your life. \n\n\nAnother thing that I think is important to throw in there somewhere is *listening* more than talking, particularly in scenarios where you *are* ignorant. This folds into your socializing tips, but it's just so important towards building trust and likability with people that you can be a good listener. Trust when someone knows what they are talking about, ask good questions when you're unsure of something, speak when you have something to add, not just for the sake of speaking...etc. \n\nDon't think of yourself as a bullshitter or take pride in being someone who can BS their way through conversations.

Typical modern life pushes us around more than we push it around and so many things in our day-to-day experience require minimal attention and are consumptive in nature.

The 'trick' just has to be that you try to do so as a reward for doing other good work elsewhere and less as a routine. \n\nYour second edit is very important though. All of these things *are* valid and important things to consider, but there is no way anyone could take them all on at once. Even more than a couple might be overwhelming for someone who is otherwise pretty deep into the throes of their routines. \n\nNoFap is, I think, a really good introduction to this stuff because it's fairly easy to compartmentalize and it is more intimate/personal. The hope, with NoFap, I think, is that it shows you the template for how to do this with other things in your life. \n\n\nAnother thing that I think is important to throw in there somewhere is *listening* more than talking, particularly in scenarios where you *are* ignorant. This folds into your socializing tips, but it's just so important towards building trust and likability with people that you can be a good listener. Trust when someone knows what they are talking about, ask good questions when you're unsure of something, speak when you have something to add, not just for the sake of speaking...etc. \n\nDon't think of yourself as a bullshitter or take pride in being someone who can BS their way through conversations.

Go online to find a TDEE calculator and estimate how many calories you need.\n\n Cardio isn't really necessary if you are already in a caloric deficit. I prsonnally use cardio so that I can eat more on some days. So if I do 1h of cardio it allows me to eat an extra 350 calories.\n\nNext thing that helped me HUGELY was intermittent fasting. I don't eat in the morning (your body will adapt within a week or two)\nI push my first meal around 13-14pm, that allows me to eat a HUGE meal that will leave me nice and satisfied. Then I can still have a smaller meal or snack on some fruits. I eat all my calories in a 6-8hour window. So If I eat my first meal at 14pm, I will STOP eating at 20pm, and will fast until the next day 14pm. Your body will get used to it, and you will get so much energy. I always train on an empty stomach and have more energy than when I used to train after a meal\n\nI think you already know which foods to avoid, but it's better to tell yourself that you'll indulge in them once or twice a week otherwise you will go crazy and then binge. When you are counting your calories, and know exactly what you are doing, you can make choices. You will still be able to eat pizza or sweets and lose weight, because the only thing that matters at the end of the day is the number of calories you eat. \n\nA calorie is a calorie, your body doesn't know the difference from a veggie calorie or a pizza calorie. \n\nLet's say you need to eat 2000 calories a day to lose weight, you can still eat that 1500 calorie pizza, and have 500 calories left to work with and you will still be in a deficit. Hope that makes sense\n\nCheck out intermittent fasting + if it fits your macros and you will melt the fat right off.\n\nAlso, just patience and tell yourself everyday that you will get there no matter what it fucking takes.\n\nMy \"before\" pic was taken after a 50pounds weight loss so I know what you're going through :)", "id": "db0ohhb"}, {"comment": "i've started tracking my calories every single day since august 6th on myfitnesspal, and that has helped me SO much. it helps put it all in perspective and really holds me accountable for what i eat.\n\nso you got skinny, then bulked up? what changed in your diet/regimen to add on all that muscle?\n\n", "id": "db1qwoh"}, {"comment": "I never bulked.

Being around other human beings and communicating on a personal level allows you to gauge better who you are and how others perceive you. If you can't make steady eye contact and have real soul to soul talk, you will never be able to form strong relationships in life, and clearly that means personality issues that perhaps PMO is causing.\n\nGranted I've been consciously controlling my own PMO addition for about 8 days now and I can say that I feel much better overall. I seem to have recovered my libido and drive slightly. I don't get so exhausted and fatigued from mental activity and I can hold a convo with someone without getting anxious.

We don't want to be slaves to our brains, substances, stuff that harms us. And we all have to fight to overcome our addictions.

I have rarely ever been truly \"unhappy\" and if I was, I reinforced it by thinking about it all the time. It's best to just ignore the negativity and spread positivity.

The present moment is the only reality, and you need to start living truly in the present. Changing the past is not something high can do, dwelling on it is pointless. However, letting it go is something you can do, it is something you can do in the present.

"], [1, "Kudos to you for having the courage to post this. Seeing the large amount of up-votes, I guess you said something that many subscribers were/are thinking; and, seeing that the majority of the comments below the post are positive, I guess many people agree with what you wrote. And I'm sure you're elated by such a reaction. Who wouldn't be? But just because a lot of people sing praises about the post doesn't mean you're right. In fact, I have to agree with the dissenters because this post seems wildly mistaken. \n\nTo begin, you pointed out that \"shit-posts\" are being up-voted while \"quality\" posts are being neglected. The first thing we must ask: What is wrong with \"shit-posts\", with people posting about the early-days \"benefits\" of abstaining? And what's wrong with fellow subscribers supporting shit-posts? Also, what criteria distinguishes a \"quality\" post from an impoverished post? My answer to the last question: I esteem a well formatted post about the good and bad effects of abstaining, but such a post may not interest another subscriber. Other subscribers may enjoy reading shit-posts because the posts are facile and easily read. What I'm saying is that quality will ultimately be relative because it is subjective. \n\n\"I'm not saying those people are wrong,\" you said, \"but it's promoting the wrong image and goal of NoFap.\" I'm not sure if that sentence was intended as an answer to something, but it raised more questions than it answered. If you're not calling shit-posts wrong\u2014although, to me, it seems you are calling them wrong\u2014then why write this rant? Furthermore, what exactly is the goal of No-fap? Is there a single goal in No-fap, or are their many goals? Moreover, if there is a single goal, how is that goal determined? \n\nI'm amoral, so I don't believe in abstaining per se. That is, for me, there is a plurality of goals, and no fap is one of the avenues through which I achieve those goals. If I believe I could achieve those goals without No-fap, then I wouldn't be here. Can the same be said for others? I don't know. Continuing, what is a better promotion than, If You Stop Jacking-Off, You'll Get Laid? Perhaps it will attract a lot of people for the wrong reasons but it will attract people. And once they're here, they can learn all about No-fap.\n\n\n \"Nofap isn't going to turn you into a beast or some chick magnet two weeks in or less.\" How do you know? Perhaps it doesn't happen for you, but who is to say it doesn't happen for others? However, I think I understand what you're trying to say here: newcomers shouldn't be discouraged if they're not drowning in attention from women and lifting two hundred pounds with their pinkies while warming up at the gym by the end of two weeks of abstaining. (Another question, why do we treat women like automatons, as if women were deductive arguments where the conclusion must follow from the premises, as if they must like us because of certain possessions?)\n\n \"You aren't going to turn into Chad Thundercock if you don't pmo for a few days. You aren't going to turn into superman a few weeks in. The people that say those things after 4 days are also the people to relapse by the end of the week.\" I know I'm being pedantic, but you should have put the word \"many\" at the start of these sentences because you chance being misinterpreted.\n\nRegarding your last paragraph: \n\nYou may not have experienced \"superpowers\" after a few days, but that doesn't mean others have not. Also, insofar as subscribers write well formatted posts telling of their long journey in No-fap\u2014to use your word, \"quality\" posts\u2014 then why should anyone have a problem with shit-posts? If you don't like shit-posts, then ignore them. And why suppose that all newcomers are simpleminded enough to believe they can redress a decade or more of damage in a few days? \n\nIn conclusion, it seems this rant\u2014as one would expect from most rants\u2014is facile. \n Is this a parody?"], [1, "Agreed."], [1, "I agree.

", "id": "d7fqp00"}], [{"comment": "Kudos to you for having the courage to post this. Seeing the large amount of up-votes, I guess you said something that many subscribers were/are thinking; and, seeing that the majority of the comments below the post are positive, I guess many people agree with what you wrote. And I'm sure you're elated by such a reaction. Who wouldn't be? But just because a lot of people sing praises about the post doesn't mean you're right. In fact, I have to agree with the dissenters because this post seems wildly mistaken. \n\nTo begin, you pointed out that \"shit-posts\" are being up-voted while \"quality\" posts are being neglected. The first thing we must ask: What is wrong with \"shit-posts\", with people posting about the early-days \"benefits\" of abstaining? And what's wrong with fellow subscribers supporting shit-posts? Also, what criteria distinguishes a \"quality\" post from an impoverished post? My answer to the last question: I esteem a well formatted post about the good and bad effects of abstaining, but such a post may not interest another subscriber. Other subscribers may enjoy reading shit-posts because the posts are facile and easily read. What I'm saying is that quality will ultimately be relative because it is subjective. \n\n\"I'm not saying those people are wrong,\" you said, \"but it's promoting the wrong image and goal of NoFap.\" I'm not sure if that sentence was intended as an answer to something, but it raised more questions than it answered. If you're not calling shit-posts wrong\u2014although, to me, it seems you are calling them wrong\u2014then why write this rant? Furthermore, what exactly is the goal of No-fap? Is there a single goal in No-fap, or are their many goals? Moreover, if there is a single goal, how is that goal determined? \n\nI'm amoral, so I don't believe in abstaining per se. That is, for me, there is a plurality of goals, and no fap is one of the avenues through which I achieve those goals. If I believe I could achieve those goals without No-fap, then I wouldn't be here. Can the same be said for others? I don't know. Continuing, what is a better promotion than, If You Stop Jacking-Off, You'll Get Laid? Perhaps it will attract a lot of people for the wrong reasons but it will attract people. And once they're here, they can learn all about No-fap.\n\n\n \"Nofap isn't going to turn you into a beast or some chick magnet two weeks in or less.\" How do you know? Perhaps it doesn't happen for you, but who is to say it doesn't happen for others? However, I think I understand what you're trying to say here: newcomers shouldn't be discouraged if they're not drowning in attention from women and lifting two hundred pounds with their pinkies while warming up at the gym by the end of two weeks of abstaining. (Another question, why do we treat women like automatons, as if women were deductive arguments where the conclusion must follow from the premises, as if they must like us because of certain possessions?)\n\n \"You aren't going to turn into Chad Thundercock if you don't pmo for a few days. You aren't going to turn into superman a few weeks in. The people that say those things after 4 days are also the people to relapse by the end of the week.\" I know I'm being pedantic, but you should have put the word \"many\" at the start of these sentences because you chance being misinterpreted.\n\nRegarding your last paragraph: \n\nYou may not have experienced \"superpowers\" after a few days, but that doesn't mean others have not. Also, insofar as subscribers write well formatted posts telling of their long journey in No-fap\u2014to use your word, \"quality\" posts\u2014 then why should anyone have a problem with shit-posts? If you don't like shit-posts, then ignore them. And why suppose that all newcomers are simpleminded enough to believe they can redress a decade or more of damage in a few days? \n\nIn conclusion, it seems this rant\u2014as one would expect from most rants\u2014is facile. \n Is this a parody?", "id": "d7fr1wv"}], [{"comment": "Agreed.", "id": "d7fsr3e"}], [{"comment": "I agree.

It seemed to me that the writer was a woman who knew a single guy who made her life miserable even though he didn't mean to. Let me debunk most of that stuff.\n\n>Nice Guys are dishonest.\n\nNice guys are fundamentally honest. They literally CANNOT lie. Even if they do, they cannot keep it up for long. That is probably what \"nice\" means. That's why most of them do not like pranking, flirting games, pretending, or other stuff that requires to hide their true self. It is excruciating for them and they need to end it as soon as possible when they enter such situation.\n\n>Nice Guys are secretive.\n\nThey probably are, but there are many who are not. There are millions of reasons to be secretive and they are not linked to being nice. Becoming vulnerable, having a shady past, engaging controversial activities, having low self-image. Do only nice guys do them?\n\n>Nice Guys are compartmentalized.\n\nI don't know how to comment on that really. ALL men are compartmentalized. There is nothing bad with this. We just thing differently from women. Not better or worse, just with different mental procedures. Have you ever read [this](http://9gag.com/gag/a6yEpR9/the-nothing-box)? it is made for fun mostly, but I find it intriguingly spot on.\n\nEdit: I'd like also to add that the writer has probably never spoken with women about their opinion on things. If guys are compartmentalized 1 time, women are 10x more. There are few exceptions, but the rule of thumb that governs female thinking is that: \"I think I know everything, I generalize everything, but none of these apply to myself, because my situation is unique\" \n\n>Nice Guys are manipulative\n\nDue to the fact that nice guys are fundamentally honest, I find this hard to grasp. I'd bet my head that most, if not all, nice guys are very easily manipulatED themselves. If some of them employ manipulation, I have yet to see someone actually succeed.\n\n>Nice Guys are controlling.\n\nUnless you are in the jungle with only a hatchet in your hand, you versus the environment, I see little reason why NOT to be controlling. We as humans tend to control our environment because we can, because we feel better and more confident in familiar and non-threatening situations. Those who don't are viewed as aloof and absent-minded at best or with unstable mental condition at worse. Control is the expression of one's strength of will, his material power and his ability to act in order to change their environment to their purposes instead of sitting idly. E.g. point me at a successful businessman who is not controlling. And please don't say that all businessmen are nice guys.\n\n>Nice Guys give to get.\n\nThis is a truly horrible way to describe the fact that nice guys have a very strong sense of gratitude. Nice guys are most of the time not used to be treated nicely (The book you are quoting states that this is almost always the reason they are nice in the first place), so if someone treats them nicely, they won't forget. Nice guys are also incredibly loyal for this reason. It is just their mind set. So, encountering a non-grateful person really contradicts their own state of mind and that is why they detest him. Nice guys really resent the wrong sense of self-entitlement they see in other people since their own sense of self-entitlement comes from (subjectively) positive actions."], [4, "Great book.

It seemed to me that the writer was a woman who knew a single guy who made her life miserable even though he didn't mean to. Let me debunk most of that stuff.\n\n>Nice Guys are dishonest.\n\nNice guys are fundamentally honest. They literally CANNOT lie. Even if they do, they cannot keep it up for long. That is probably what \"nice\" means. That's why most of them do not like pranking, flirting games, pretending, or other stuff that requires to hide their true self. It is excruciating for them and they need to end it as soon as possible when they enter such situation.\n\n>Nice Guys are secretive.\n\nThey probably are, but there are many who are not. There are millions of reasons to be secretive and they are not linked to being nice. Becoming vulnerable, having a shady past, engaging controversial activities, having low self-image. Do only nice guys do them?\n\n>Nice Guys are compartmentalized.\n\nI don't know how to comment on that really. ALL men are compartmentalized. There is nothing bad with this. We just thing differently from women. Not better or worse, just with different mental procedures. Have you ever read [this](http://9gag.com/gag/a6yEpR9/the-nothing-box)? it is made for fun mostly, but I find it intriguingly spot on.\n\nEdit: I'd like also to add that the writer has probably never spoken with women about their opinion on things. If guys are compartmentalized 1 time, women are 10x more. There are few exceptions, but the rule of thumb that governs female thinking is that: \"I think I know everything, I generalize everything, but none of these apply to myself, because my situation is unique\" \n\n>Nice Guys are manipulative\n\nDue to the fact that nice guys are fundamentally honest, I find this hard to grasp. I'd bet my head that most, if not all, nice guys are very easily manipulatED themselves. If some of them employ manipulation, I have yet to see someone actually succeed.\n\n>Nice Guys are controlling.\n\nUnless you are in the jungle with only a hatchet in your hand, you versus the environment, I see little reason why NOT to be controlling. We as humans tend to control our environment because we can, because we feel better and more confident in familiar and non-threatening situations. Those who don't are viewed as aloof and absent-minded at best or with unstable mental condition at worse. Control is the expression of one's strength of will, his material power and his ability to act in order to change their environment to their purposes instead of sitting idly. E.g. point me at a successful businessman who is not controlling. And please don't say that all businessmen are nice guys.\n\n>Nice Guys give to get.\n\nThis is a truly horrible way to describe the fact that nice guys have a very strong sense of gratitude. Nice guys are most of the time not used to be treated nicely (The book you are quoting states that this is almost always the reason they are nice in the first place), so if someone treats them nicely, they won't forget. Nice guys are also incredibly loyal for this reason. It is just their mind set. So, encountering a non-grateful person really contradicts their own state of mind and that is why they detest him. Nice guys really resent the wrong sense of self-entitlement they see in other people since their own sense of self-entitlement comes from (subjectively) positive actions.", "id": "d1giwu0"}, {"comment": ">Nice Guys are full of rage.\n\nThis is a label put on nice guys by \"normal\" people who have literally no idea what is going on inside a nice guy's head. I have been told several times that I give the impression of an \"evil person\", but after I sit down with the accuser and explain what is really going on inside me and what drives my words and actions, everyone seems like they made a huge realization.  It is just a result of how world treats you. Most \"normal\" people are totally clueless about it. Really. They have no idea because their life was different and they have never considered even the possibility of someone having the experiences of a \"nice guy\". They never experienced it and they have never thought how could anyone go through these things until you sit down with them and explain. Is is bad? probably yes. Is it a characteristic of ALL and only nice guys? I think not.\n\n> Nice Guys are addictive.\n\nI can't comment on that. Addiction is a result of several environmental factors that all people are more or less exposed to. Are ALL/MOST nice guys addictive? I'd like to know too instead of speculating over a theory.\n\n\n> Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries.\n\nMaybe it's because they are not selfish egoistic pigs like the writer of this book describes them to be. Maybe being honest and upholding your values means something to them in contrast to what is considered \"normal\" in this western civilization... I don't know, just maybe.\n\n\n> Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful.\n\nSuccess has to do with several things. These include timing and risk-taking. A nice guys may be less successful than he can achieve because he lost a good opportunity due to timing or due to being too risky. Chasing timing and investing emotionally in risky moves is both very stressful. What I mean to say is that those nice guys are not as successful as they can be because they choose to be so. They would gladly trade a better income with their free time, serenity, stability, etc. if they don't actually need it. But some people tend to forget that these are commodities too.\n\n\n> Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing.\n\nYep. You know who is attracted to tough situations? People that need a challenge. In fact, doesn't that attest to the fact the nice guys have sorted themselves out so well that they are now ready to fix other people? Do they always succeed? probably not, but this is not the point. The point is they they try and get their hands dirty for you and they end up asking nothing in return. You know why?? Yeah, you guessed it. Because they are NICE.\n\n> Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships.\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, this is probably true. Probably due to the above....

Moreover, the heartbreak and dejection one feels when they fail, especially after being told they should be instantly recovering, is immensely damaging. A better piece of advice is to tell people that they're able to begin their journey today. But porn, like any other addiction or bad habit, isn't broken in a day.

We seek progress, not perfection. I understand that your instantaneous viewpoint works for you, but it's not as helpful for the masses. I've been in SLAA for 2 years now, and no one has been able to cut out all relapses immediately, and it's not because their mindset was wrong.

I watched porn for 13 years myself, and it took me 3 years of rebooting to fully recover, and if I lapsed once, it would have set me back, so failing was not an option.

The illusion of being able to deal with it is what allows it to progress, until true powerlessness is imposed upon the person via consequences.

Abstinence is definitely NOT the answer, but it is a requirement if you are to move into some sort of recovery. What I've found in my journey thus far is that the addiction is actually fueled by what C.G. Jung would refer to as **\"the shadow.\"** *The accumulation of all the energies/parts of myself I've disowned over the years as a result of being shamed or discouraged by others throughout my childhood/adolescence/etc.* We all have parts of ourselves we learn are \"not good\" or \"unacceptable\" by society/parents/teachers/peers as we grow up. **We disown these parts of ourselves and basically lose touch with the wholeness of our being as these parts are unconsciously cast away in an attempt for us adapt.** As a result, we feel an emptiness that we try to fill with our addiction. 12 step groups offer the *12 step process* which is some SERIOUS shadow work and can help to allow these energies to reintegrate into your being, **thus helping to restore one to the state of completeness that one is unconsciously seeking through their addiction to porn/alcohol/sex/gambling/drugs/etc.** If you can find a **Big book step study** meeting in your area, these cats focus directly on the 12 step process that these groups were intended for. It's unfortunate that it has become extremely difficult in 12 step groups to find groups that actually focus on the 12 steps rather than treating the meetings as group therapy sessions. Not surprising the rates of success in these groups are ridiculously low compared to when they first began in the 1930s.\nAlso, I've work with a Bioenergetics/Gestalt therapist. The whole work with this also is **reintegrating these energies back into one's being.** Shadow work again.\nWanted to share this with you guys because you've written some very intelligent stuff and I felt that you guys might be receptive to these ideas I've found on my path with all of this.

When it comes to others, we already have a screwed up relationship with others...and fapping to hardcore porn PROVES we're unacceptable at some kind of unfixable level.  That's the belief.  \n\n In addiction recovery programs, people focus on \"The Steps\".   The discovery is made that we have some kind of abandonment trauma going on..where we split from our real selves.  To ease the pain of a broken self, we medicate...spiralling down.  It's like \"the problem\" is that I have a \"lonely me\" and this relationship to a medication that proves I DESERVE to be alone due to being so \"bad\". \n\n What's even more fucked up is that the more \"bad\" I am, the more dopamine.  Welcome to morphing porn tastes and \"spiralling down\".   Soon we can't get our most basic human needs met...and that attracts us to other people in the same state (at best)...as we push away people where a healthy EXCHANGE (relationship) could happen.\n\nHere's a short excerpt of a book that explains some of this addiction stuff.

(and congrats! it seems like you are succeeding at step one already and actually incorporating step two behaviors into your life too!)\n\nStep two is to re-channel that feeling (really, re-channeling it into ANYthing else thats not masturbation is fine when you first stop your PMO).\n\nStep three, the final step, is using that feeling of horniness for what it was intended for.  Its a natural drive, part of being human and being alive.  You lose your essence if you try to just shut it off completely, or deny it.  Your feeling of honiness is part of your life force, it gives us energy and passion to do the work we need to do to meet and have sex with women.  Eventually, you will be in touch with yourself at deeper levels, and you can let your natural, healthy, undistorted pure desire lead you to what you (as a man) were born to do.\n\nOnce you have your PMO under control, you will look forward to feeling horny, because you know it will make you do those things you need to do, get out of the house, meet women, seduce and bed them, just to satisfy it.\n\nYou see, the ultimate goal is not to deny or suppress your nature biological urges.  The goal isn't to become less virile, or to never be horny.

Temptation but never told myself that (to get out of avoiding PMO).\n\n **4.)** Never had this problem either, I've had the opposite happen though, after a relapse I'd often take a break. Never had a super long streak either, only a 33/34 day streak.\n\n **5.)** Not really had this problem either, I am a somewhat perfectionist however, when I see erotic/porn-y stuff that arouses me and I don't look away enough I count that as a relapse and it demotivates me.\n\n **6.)** Never had this one, I'm in it for avoiding porn just as much if not more, fapping habits aren't anywhere even close to near as bad as porn addiction in my opinion.\n\n **7.)** Never had this one.\n\n **8.)** I've had similar to this, like thinking I'll never be in a relationship again or that I don't want to be in one again. I know that's not the only reason to avoid porn and fapping though, of course.\n\n **9.)** Never had this one.\n\n**10.)** I'm definitely a procrastinator but I wouldn't say I've procrastinated NoFap, really.

If I were single anyway. Not sure I'd watch or look at porn though.\n\n**13.)** I would know I'm not cured but I would probably masturbate after around 100 days assuming I was single.

I started talking to girls at work, and i was making them laugh, wasn't having anxiety and i well... i made them laugh. Next day for some reason i started acting like a total jerk, and the things i said i meant jokingly but when it came out of my mouth the tone was in all seriousness. This girl i got to know called me an asshole, something i've never been called in my life. i've been contemplating it ever since, and the only solution was because i'm grumpy, and I'm grumpy because i haven't jacked off. Than i thought why not come here, just because maybe. Maybe something will help me keep going past this week plateau that i always break. Being called an asshole hurt. A lot. But in truth it really is because I'm weak. I can't take criticism. My ego won't allow it. And the soul part. Thats what gets me going but than slowly fades as the days go by.

Some is from personal experience, some of it is beginning to see hints of such things and coming to realize entire new sets of problems that can come with such \"superpowers.\" Also, experiencing mistakes and pitfalls that I didn't previously anticipate. Experiencing stages of cockiness or overconfidence that lead to problems. Often when we believe we've \"made it\" we're really only at the beginning. Right when we believe we're at the top something unexpected knocks us down. There are many layers to truth, and some truths I've recently learned fall in line with some of the comments seen here. Essentially \"with great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nThe reason I posted it this way was not only an honest writing, but because one of the things I see around here a lot is depression. Disbelief in one's own self. A lot of times positivity feels too far away from depression to even feel realistic when one is in a deep pit despair. If you've never hit rock bottom then you don't know what it's like. Often when we're in that pit the only real way to get out is regain a sense of power over one's self. Sometimes positivity is not the answer to regaining a feeling of power, but anger is. Being angry with your addiction. Angry with yourself. Angry at one's inability to do what one needs to do. When we want to kick someone's ass then we start to move out of that pit and up the emotional ladder towards greater things.\n\nTherefore this post isn't targeted at those who feel they've already made it. It's targeted at those who are in the pit. Or it's targeted at those who think that first wave of confidence experienced on a 30 day streak is the end goal. It's not. There is always more.

I met a beautiful white South African girl and the first 3 times we have had sex I have trouble not only getting hard but staying hard... I successfully had sex with her until she orgasmed, but I cannot stay hard for extended periods of time and it makes her feel unattractive. Fortunately, she is being patient with me after I explained everything honest to her... I just pray to god that I can start getting normal boners again because porn SERIOUSLY fucked me up and I didn't realize that this could happen.

It reminds me of something my husband did.\nI was very excited to be marrying the man of my dreams. I had fantasized how magical our marriage and sex life would be, when tragedy struck.\n\nAfter our wedding four months ago we planned a two-week honeymoon on an island, where we could celebrate our marriage and fuck each other senseless. But a few hours before our flight I fell sick and had to be rushed to hospital. My appendix had burst. The doctors said the condition was not life threatening and with surgery I should be back on my feet soon.\n\nA week later I was discharged but the incision on my stomach prevented us having sex for at least a month or two. I felt sorry for my husband because I knew how horny he could get. I would give him blowjobs, but that was not enough.\n\nHe wanted more.\n\nHe was 26 years old and at his sexual peak. Sex was all he could think about. I thought of getting him a prostitute, but that would be stooping too low. I wanted to get him a woman that my husband could fuck as I watched.\n\nThere was no-one else I would allow my husband to fuck other than my best friend, Terry. She had seen me through thick and thin and had been my maid of honor. I trusted her completely. A week after I was discharged from the hospital she visited me at home in my bedroom.\n\nTerry sat next to the bed and we talked. I was not sure how she would react if I told her to fuck my husband.\n\n\u2018Terry, I want to tell you something. You are the only one who can help,\u2019 I said.\n\nShe held both of my hands and looked me straight in the eyes.\n\n\u2018Anything for you,\u2019 she replied with concern.\n\n\u2018I want you to fuck my husband tonight,\u2019 I said.\n\nShe gave me a questioning look, so I explained everything and she agreed. I called my husband and told him to be home early as I had a surprise for him. At around six he knocked at the front door and I rushed to open it.\n\n\u2018My love, I want to blindfold you because I have a surprise,\u2019 I told him.\n\nHe was a little reluctant as I removed his coat, shoes, socks and led him to our bedroom, where soft music was playing.\n\n\u2018What is going on Doreen? You know we can\u2019t have sex just yet, I will hurt you,\u2019 he said with concern.\n\nAll I could do was giggle. At the bedroom door, I asked him to wait while I unwrapped his present. Terry was on our bed wearing one of my silk negligees.\n\n\u2018Now take off your blindfold,\u2019 I told my husband.\n\nWhen he could see her, I pointed at Terry and said erotically,\n\n\u2018Here is your present. Now I want you to fuck her and fill her pussy with cum.\u2019\n\nMy husband was a little taken aback. He never thought I would go this far.\n\nHe approached Terry slowly. Her arms were open. They started kissing as I watched, I badly wanted to join in but this was my husband\u2019s present and I wanted him to savor the moment. I had watched Terry fuck her boyfriend a couple of times and I knew my husband would be pleased.\n\nSeductively Terry removed the negligee to expose nothing but white pants. My husband began kissing her luscious lips, which were already wet.\n\nTerry began undressing my husband and when she held his massive cock on her hand I felt a little jealous. My husband knelt in front of her while Terry got on all fours and took my husband\u2019s cock into her mouth.\n\nAs my husband fucked her mouth her breasts were moving up and down, making me to want to suck them. This was the most erotic thing I had ever witnessed and it made my pussy tingle with excitement. Terry knew what she was doing and my husband was moaning with pleasure when she took all his balls into her mouth.\n\nI knew my husband would not disappoint.\n\nHe laid Terry on the bed to get the full view of her swollen pussy, which was dripping wet. Using his fingers he started playing with her cunt lips. Terry squeezed my bed sheets when two fingers were inserted into her.\n\nMy husband tasted her pussy by putting his fingers into his mouth, then smiled and extended his finger to my direction. I slowly walked to the bed to taste my best friend\u2019s pussy but I already knew how it tasted. He lowered his head onto her clit sucking her cunt lips, sending Terry shivering and screaming.\n\n\u2018Oh \u2026 don\u2019t stop,\u2019 she cried.\n\nShe grabbed the back of his head to allow his tongue to explore the inside of her wet pussy.\n\nI was touching Terry\u2019s nipples, which were as hard as rocks and I wanted to suck them when my husband told her,\n\n\u2018It\u2019s time for me to fuck you.\u2019\n\nTerry beamed with joy as she got into position. Using her fingers she parted her pink lips to accommodate the monstrous cock. When she took in the full length of his shaft she let out a loud moan.\n\n\u2018Oh gosh, you are huge \u2026fuck me hard and don\u2019t stop,\u2019 she said.\n\nI moved away to create space for them while I concentrated on pleasuring myself. I slipped my finger inside my pussy, which had already drenched my silky pants. The smell of sex filled the room as they continued fucking and moaning. My husband turned Terry to enter her from the side while he used one hand to rub her clit.\n\nI guess this was too much for Terry because she started screaming and shaking. My husband increased the intensity as her pussy gushed white juices all over my husband\u2019s dick.\n\nThe juice was too much and it oozed out. My husband favorite style was doggy and when he brought Terry on all fours I knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before he drowned her pussy with so much cum.\n\nA moment later I heard a sound I was so accustomed to and I knew this was it. As much as Terry was fucking my man, I had to taste his cum and pussy juices that would ooze out in just a moment. I ran as my husband\u2019s tight ass stiffened and I knew he was shooting his delicious juice into Terry\u2019s cunt.\n\nWhen he pulled out his dick my mouth was wide open to clean the whiteness that covered his cock. He shoved it into my mouth and I expertly cleaned it. I let them rest for a while and I turned to my husband\n\n\u2018I hope you enjoyed your gift. Shall we continue or have you had enough?\u2019\n\nThey didn\u2019t utter a word. Instead my best friend and her husband nodded their heads and we got ready for round two."], [1, "Thanks for sharing.

It reminds me of something my husband did.\nI was very excited to be marrying the man of my dreams. I had fantasized how magical our marriage and sex life would be, when tragedy struck.\n\nAfter our wedding four months ago we planned a two-week honeymoon on an island, where we could celebrate our marriage and fuck each other senseless. But a few hours before our flight I fell sick and had to be rushed to hospital. My appendix had burst. The doctors said the condition was not life threatening and with surgery I should be back on my feet soon.\n\nA week later I was discharged but the incision on my stomach prevented us having sex for at least a month or two. I felt sorry for my husband because I knew how horny he could get. I would give him blowjobs, but that was not enough.\n\nHe wanted more.\n\nHe was 26 years old and at his sexual peak. Sex was all he could think about. I thought of getting him a prostitute, but that would be stooping too low. I wanted to get him a woman that my husband could fuck as I watched.\n\nThere was no-one else I would allow my husband to fuck other than my best friend, Terry. She had seen me through thick and thin and had been my maid of honor. I trusted her completely. A week after I was discharged from the hospital she visited me at home in my bedroom.\n\nTerry sat next to the bed and we talked. I was not sure how she would react if I told her to fuck my husband.\n\n\u2018Terry, I want to tell you something. You are the only one who can help,\u2019 I said.\n\nShe held both of my hands and looked me straight in the eyes.\n\n\u2018Anything for you,\u2019 she replied with concern.\n\n\u2018I want you to fuck my husband tonight,\u2019 I said.\n\nShe gave me a questioning look, so I explained everything and she agreed. I called my husband and told him to be home early as I had a surprise for him. At around six he knocked at the front door and I rushed to open it.\n\n\u2018My love, I want to blindfold you because I have a surprise,\u2019 I told him.\n\nHe was a little reluctant as I removed his coat, shoes, socks and led him to our bedroom, where soft music was playing.\n\n\u2018What is going on Doreen? You know we can\u2019t have sex just yet, I will hurt you,\u2019 he said with concern.\n\nAll I could do was giggle. At the bedroom door, I asked him to wait while I unwrapped his present. Terry was on our bed wearing one of my silk negligees.\n\n\u2018Now take off your blindfold,\u2019 I told my husband.\n\nWhen he could see her, I pointed at Terry and said erotically,\n\n\u2018Here is your present. Now I want you to fuck her and fill her pussy with cum.\u2019\n\nMy husband was a little taken aback. He never thought I would go this far.\n\nHe approached Terry slowly. Her arms were open. They started kissing as I watched, I badly wanted to join in but this was my husband\u2019s present and I wanted him to savor the moment. I had watched Terry fuck her boyfriend a couple of times and I knew my husband would be pleased.\n\nSeductively Terry removed the negligee to expose nothing but white pants. My husband began kissing her luscious lips, which were already wet.\n\nTerry began undressing my husband and when she held his massive cock on her hand I felt a little jealous. My husband knelt in front of her while Terry got on all fours and took my husband\u2019s cock into her mouth.\n\nAs my husband fucked her mouth her breasts were moving up and down, making me to want to suck them. This was the most erotic thing I had ever witnessed and it made my pussy tingle with excitement. Terry knew what she was doing and my husband was moaning with pleasure when she took all his balls into her mouth.\n\nI knew my husband would not disappoint.\n\nHe laid Terry on the bed to get the full view of her swollen pussy, which was dripping wet. Using his fingers he started playing with her cunt lips. Terry squeezed my bed sheets when two fingers were inserted into her.\n\nMy husband tasted her pussy by putting his fingers into his mouth, then smiled and extended his finger to my direction. I slowly walked to the bed to taste my best friend\u2019s pussy but I already knew how it tasted. He lowered his head onto her clit sucking her cunt lips, sending Terry shivering and screaming.\n\n\u2018Oh \u2026 don\u2019t stop,\u2019 she cried.\n\nShe grabbed the back of his head to allow his tongue to explore the inside of her wet pussy.\n\nI was touching Terry\u2019s nipples, which were as hard as rocks and I wanted to suck them when my husband told her,\n\n\u2018It\u2019s time for me to fuck you.\u2019\n\nTerry beamed with joy as she got into position. Using her fingers she parted her pink lips to accommodate the monstrous cock. When she took in the full length of his shaft she let out a loud moan.\n\n\u2018Oh gosh, you are huge \u2026fuck me hard and don\u2019t stop,\u2019 she said.\n\nI moved away to create space for them while I concentrated on pleasuring myself. I slipped my finger inside my pussy, which had already drenched my silky pants. The smell of sex filled the room as they continued fucking and moaning. My husband turned Terry to enter her from the side while he used one hand to rub her clit.\n\nI guess this was too much for Terry because she started screaming and shaking. My husband increased the intensity as her pussy gushed white juices all over my husband\u2019s dick.\n\nThe juice was too much and it oozed out. My husband favorite style was doggy and when he brought Terry on all fours I knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before he drowned her pussy with so much cum.\n\nA moment later I heard a sound I was so accustomed to and I knew this was it. As much as Terry was fucking my man, I had to taste his cum and pussy juices that would ooze out in just a moment. I ran as my husband\u2019s tight ass stiffened and I knew he was shooting his delicious juice into Terry\u2019s cunt.\n\nWhen he pulled out his dick my mouth was wide open to clean the whiteness that covered his cock. He shoved it into my mouth and I expertly cleaned it. I let them rest for a while and I turned to my husband\n\n\u2018I hope you enjoyed your gift. Shall we continue or have you had enough?\u2019\n\nThey didn\u2019t utter a word. Instead my best friend and her husband nodded their heads and we got ready for round two.", "id": "d7hcfu3"}, {"comment": "Did not work", "id": "d7k4r3x"}, {"comment": "Pretty funny tho.

I'd strongly suggest a couple of things. One: write down the pros and cons of quitting PMO. Take enough time to really mediate on the list and keep it in mind throughout the following journey. 2: Establish keystone habits to replace the old. I focused on two things: making my bed and exercising. If I can do those, I can build momentum/self-discipline to not look too much at porn.\n\nWhile doing this, I realized that I didn't love myself enough to escape the spiral. I can guarantee that moving away from this(or any addiction) must stem from an act of self-love and maintaining one's abstinence from the addiction will require a constant focus on self-love. I love myself too much to look at porn knowing that the cons associated with consuming it do not outweigh the benefits of not consuming it. It makes not seeking it that much easier!

Most users here aren't up for discussion or debate because they resort to childish remarks if you dare to question their beliefs along with abusing the upvote/downvote system. A lot of the information I learned about the true dangers of PMO wasn't from here, it was from going out of my way to find that information through books because I always found the super powers claims to be contradictory and absurd. Thanks to this subreddit, I realize that people are so gullible to follow what the common crowd says instead of looking up information for themselves and realize the truth. This subreddit has taught me that the same thing applies to religion.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that these Reddit users idolize women way too much. Way too much. The point of quitting porn is to simply quit porn and return to your normal state, not getting out of the world super powers and be alpha. With porn, you're idolizing women. With Nofap Reddit, you're idolizing women. WHERE IS THE CHANGE HERE??? They glorify sex too much which is worrisome and should tell you that our society is becoming too hyper sexualized. Sex is a normal function like eating food, it's nothing special, yet they believe its the most beautiful thing in the world.

But my main reason is now for my convictions, not simply because I want to meet a girl.\n\nSure, I want a woman, but I also want children that I can teach manliness to, and I want to have energy to give them, and to be able to work super duper hard with no brain fog - ESPECIALLY as a future nurse.\n\nThis and other posts recently have really been setting things back into perspective for me.

One god controlled the underworld, another guarded one of the other gods. That's great and all, but these Romans were scooping up a lot of people. Their rulers after a time became very tolerant; anybody could believe anything, as long as they respected Rome's own gods.\n\nSo this goes on a while.

I don't know what is it with Reddit but it always promotes cult like behavior. Everytime I join a subreddit, it's always the same echo-chamber with no diversity of opinions. I guess the saying is true \"Reddit is full of dumb people trying to act smart\".\n\nThis subreddit (keyword: subreddit) is very cult like. Most users here aren't up for discussion or debate because they resort to childish remarks if you dare to question their beliefs along with abusing the upvote/downvote system. A lot of the information I learned about the true dangers of PMO wasn't from here, it was from going out of my way to find that information through books because I always found the super powers claims to be contradictory and absurd. Thanks to this subreddit, I realize that people are so gullible to follow what the common crowd says instead of looking up information for themselves and realize the truth. This subreddit has taught me that the same thing applies to religion.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that these Reddit users idolize women way too much. Way too much. The point of quitting porn is to simply quit porn and return to your normal state, not getting out of the world super powers and be alpha. With porn, you're idolizing women. With Nofap Reddit, you're idolizing women. WHERE IS THE CHANGE HERE??? They glorify sex too much which is worrisome and should tell you that our society is becoming too hyper sexualized. Sex is a normal function like eating food, it's nothing special, yet they believe its the most beautiful thing in the world. Maybe in movies yeah, but these people seriously need to wake up from reality. I agree with what you said, there are so much absurd posts on the top page that I often question myself why do people upvote it in the first place. It really needs to stop. Then there are those users justifying their actions with 5th grade level reasoning that \"they're not doing anything wrong xD Let them be!!! Don't judge!!!!!\".  No. One thing is truly noticing benefits and an another is just pulling stuff out your behind to justify NoFap \"super powers\" and get upvoted.

You tell me my description is far from what an alpha/beta system is, but from a quick google search you will find that many articles that define characteristics of an alpha and beta male, or certain individuals are born with these traits. An alpha male is a dominant leader that possesses attractive qualities that gains the attention of all women. A beta male is a submissive man that has qualities that are not as attractive as an alpha male. Betas are the second choice according to the alpha/beta belief. Alphas are not necessarily good, and betas are not necessarily bad. Therefore, I'm not defining people who have their shit together as alpha and betas. My point is that people either have their shit together or they don't, and that we shouldn't define these people as alpha and betas, because not only is it petty but condescending. When OP called the members of the community who struggle with NoFap as betas, his opinion seemed patronizing to me. OP also previously mentioned that the members of the community should not treat women like goddesses.

Did you enjoy life more as a kid? Were things more fun, stimulating, exciting? Losing that feeling isn't part of growing up, it dies when we numb ourselves with these instant pleasures. You can have that feeling again.\n\nWhy don't you try? Nobody will die if you don't clean your rifle for 15-20 days.

Kudos to you, my dear sir...\nSecond, could u please elaborate on how to do lucide dreaming? I've been trying to do that for a long time now.. Is there a link to a website or a video perhaps.. ", "id": "d1eujhz"}, {"comment": "Lucid dreaming can take some time and its something that you practice over a multitude of days. Alright lets start with the basics\n\nDream awareness - this is important because your analyzing reality and when you are coming to a Dream which is a copy of reality but not exactly reality, thus it is important to have a reality check.\n\nMy reality check in dreams was mostly to try and look towards my body and then I would try and pinch myself. Often most of the time the sense of pain would be distorted and I would not be able to feel it or something that is not even close to it. Once you have this reality check keep doing it every few hours possibly every 3 eventually till you get into a habit of it, a reality check could be as easy as looking at the time. The brain remembers processes as they are repeated.\n\nUpon sleeping you begin to drift and your thoughts collect in your mind as you come closer to an dream your thoughts tend to fade and instead you tend to visualize pictures and scenarios when I was this stage I would often have a background thought which would remind me I was going into a dream.\n\nDreams often had signs and mine where the placement of my computer in my dreams, I had began to notice in almost all of my dreams there would be the same type of computer as the one I used in real life for all my work in the room, This soon began another reality check to whether I was in the dream or not.\n\nI had started mediation almost 2 years ago and since then it has helped me to capture dreams when I am within them simply because it raises my awareness to my surroundings rather than having my focus self - centered on myself. People have susceptibility to meditation and are like man that's for old people, I dare you not it is. Its for everyone the earlier you start, the faster your perspective of life shall change and not just that you will be able to see details which you were able to not see. This is the path of spiritualist.\n\nOften one of the cases that arise when you begin lucid dreaming is that you release its a dream and it causes you to jump out of the dream. When you have awareness of your dream refrain from too much emotion rather explore the surrondings and you might learn something new about yourself. My dream once had room with a huge clock when suspecting this clock I had found someone tied behind it, as the clock turned the person tied behind the clock grew from a child to an old man eventually what seemed to him dieing, to his body dieing and then his bones turning into dust infront of me. It had a really philosophical meaning towards life and the Time we have and really changed the way I looked towards my life. Whether that person on the clock was me or not I couldn't recognize because the face of that person had become distorted.\n\nFor a person that doesn't meditate an easier method is to simply listening to something known as binuarl beats, well these are beats assumed at different frequency gaps which allow to elate your brain to lower states of the brain primarly from the beta state which is your conscious, to the alpha state which is day dreaming and light dream iniation to the theta state which is dreaming and mediation and lastly to the delta state where the healing of the body occurs.\n\nHope that helps my man and good luck, I myself am trying to intiate active lucid dreaming through meditation where I am can place myself in the dreamworld with full conscious being able to change but have had little luck, something similar to inception I guess. But this is certainly not an substuite for real life rather during my alone time a way to learn more about the mind and its wonders, more like a pet project", "id": "d1f135k"}], [{"comment": "Congrats!

It can be difficult to grasp initially but once you have the grasp of it use it to destroy that urge in the dream world. My experience where many I would often dream about coming to a room within an exquisite hotel, one of those fancy antique ones with paintings and all and there would be a large red bed and this women possible the best woman I had seen physically would be lying on the bed slowly stripping her clothes. I could feel my boner, My dick was bigger in the dream world, I felt an static charge of energy like an animal which would pounce on his prey, Body was much bigger and stronger and my hair was much longer. These were all the suppressed urges, my mind had given me everything I had longed for and the woman of the dreams in front of me. I used a Trigger at that time simply bit into my arm and I couldn't feel the pain or the pain was minimal, I looked at the clock and it gave a different time every time eventually I snapped out of it and closed my eyes and well imagined shouting to get access back to the real world. Well I woke up at 3am sweating, my muscles were hot as if bursting out of my body and with a raging boner. Instantly took a cold shower luckily I hadn't blew all my hardwork :), This happened many times and It would be the same women too, she would often frown as I would turn her down in my dreams :P. I dont know how my mind made her up and whether she was based on someone real never tried to investigate tho.\n\nWet dream wake up - Reality triggers keep doing them until there is something wrong and don't succumb to what your mind throws at you, You are in control of your mind and your body not the other way around good luck bruh :)", "id": "d1f1a24"}, {"comment": "Thanks for honest explanation.

This can be travel by airplane, the making of a juice via a blender, etc. Dopamine is not only received through fapping, but through enjoyment of foods, use of drugs, video gaming, etc. We don't yet as a species fully comprehend the brain.

It just happens to make your life subjectively better.\n\nI believe our sense of morality comes from something beyond our simple brain chemistry, but I understand your statement.\n\n>You can always ask these questions, but if you're doing it out of nihilism you constantly defeat yourself.\n\nQuite the opposite actually, I'm trying to get people to ask where their morals come from, and so far no one seems to be able to provide me an answer =/\n\n> If you're on this sub for self improvement, ask yourself if you actually believe in these questions? They constantly regress into attitudes of defeat, a meanginless existence, and infinite questions of why in ways that take away from life instead of adding to it.\n\nI don't believe anything I'm asking, I believe our moral base and purpose on Earth is outlined in the Bible and explained by God himself to each individual throughout their lifetime. I ask these nihilistic questions not because I believe them, but because I have seen no answer to them other than one that requires the belief in a moral code beyond our physical plane and interpretations. ", "id": "cyqwhj3"}, {"comment": "Well, the best way to answer your last question is to ask children where they obtain their moral code. Obviously they have innate behavior, but there is also the cultural/learned behavior. \n\nLouis C.K. has the best explanation for morality that has been said, at least so simply. Kids are mean, but they need to test it out. If you call a person a bad name and they become sad, that doesn't feel good. It doesn't require God telling you it is a bad thing. Some kids don't learn empathy and feel as bad for calling people fat etc, but many do, or did (Technology is taking this away as we lack social interaction that is face-to-face). \n\nI really believe morality is innate. It is so plainly obvious that people over look it because they believe God gave it to them. It hurts to be backstabbed, socially outcasted, verbally abused, etc. Those things do not feel good to healthy people. Psychopaths/sociopaths aren't healthy people. They lack empathy and therefore a moral code. \n\nChildren are fresh blood in life. They are fully immersed in making social circles/relationships. Half of what they know/feel comes from their direct experience with other people, others from what adults tell them. \n\nThroughout life, stressors turn many fully alive children into ghosts of human beings, so they begin to wonder what it's all about out of fear instead of wonder. They turn to the bible and other spiritual literature for guidance, which only runs them in more circles because people don't want most of the rules that come with religion. They just want to feel like children again: alive. ", "id": "cyr9e89"}, {"comment": "> Well, the best way to answer your last question is to ask children where they obtain their moral code.\n\nA child with no social influence won't understand or comprehend the idea of morals.\n\n> Obviously they have innate behavior\n\nCruel and immoral innate behavior.\n\n> Kids are mean, but they need to test it out. If you call a person a bad name and they become sad, that doesn't feel good.\n\nThat's not morality, that's empathy. There's loads of things that are immoral that don't make you feel bad when you do them.\n\n>It doesn't require God telling you it is a bad thing.\n\nAlright, then other than empathy, where do you garner your morality? Empathy is **not** in any way morality. I have empathy in many areas, but that doesn't mean acting on that empathy or not acting on it is moral. I have no empathy for the teacher when I cheat on a test, that doesn't mean that it isn't immoral. I may have no empathy for someone I murder, does that mean that psychopaths are behaving in a moral fashion because they do not have empathy?\n\n> I really believe morality is innate.\n\nProof? Animals are our best way of telling of morality is innate, and animals regularly rape, kill, steal, etc from each other. They act entirely on empathy and instinct. They are not *moral* creatures. \n\n>Psychopaths/sociopaths aren't healthy people. They lack empathy and therefore a moral code.\n\nPsychopaths aren't healthy by **YOUR** definition of heath, which is based of your moral code which in your argument is provided by empathy. Therefore, you can't make the claim that someone is 'unhealthy' they should in your worldview just be 'different.' Also, who's to say that empathy is healthy? Seems to me that getting yours and screwing everyone is much more beneficial to the individual at question and when it comes to the survival of the fittest. Without an objective ideal of what morality is, you must come to the conclusion that morality is nothing more than a defect that prevents humans from efficiently and quickly going through the process of evolutionary survival of the fittest. \n", "id": "cyrdk0m"}, {"comment": "*tears* ", "id": "cynnm78"}], [{"comment": "\"invented fire\"?", "id": "cynfwuu"}, {"comment": "I guess it should say ''Discovered''.

"], [6, "Good post. I was writing about my experience closing in on 90 days last night and I wanted to touch on some of the downsides but couldn't think quite how to put them into words. I think you've done a good job at that here. \n\nStill, some of your downsides are also upsides depending on perspective. The increased sense of vulnerability, for instance, is something I've felt as well, but I don't see this as a downside as much as I see it as a return to a more healthy emotional state. Because having that increased sensitivity and awareness to my feelings has also helped me to connect with people socially and in more meaningful ways. \n\nAlso, the major depression that accompanied my PMO addiction was far worse than the minor depressiveness that sometimes comes up now that I've abstained for a while. When I was more majorly depressed it was easier for me to make bad decisions from a 'fuck it, who cares' standpoint or otherwise 'eh I'm already fucked, it doesn't matter' or other apathetic and nihilistic views. For example, a habit I used to have that accompanied PMO was getting fast food late at night, coming home, watching a movie, watching porn, masturbating and crashing to sleep at like 2 or 3am. Since NoFap, I haven't done anything like that. It's been easier for me to go to bed at a better hour and the few occasions I've been up past 1am and thought about going to grab a burger it's been easier to resist that urge as well.\n\nWhile it's true I still get down on myself sometimes, it's less despair than it was and I have a better framework for identifying why I'm feeling down and doing something about it. Which was all but impossible in the past. \n\nThe big one though that I agree with is the sense of being lost a bit. Which I think is attributable to the fact that as helpful as NoFap can be, it is ultimately only one thing and can't rewrite your life on its own. Accomplishing it feels good and all but that doesn't mean there isn't more work to be done elsewhere. But some of those other challenges might not be as straightforward to identify or pursue. \n\nComing out of an addiction is a great thing, but just being at a point where 'okay, can live life' isn't necessarily enough if you still don't have something to focus on. \n\nStill though, while that is a negative and all, it's vastly preferable to the alternative. \n\n"], [5, "Thanks for your post.

You have no idea how helpful this is, you put into words what I have been trying to explain to myself and my support group. This is EXACTLY how I feel.

I also felt that, but now i'm entering into a phase (i'm at 141 days) where suddenly without realizing it, I realized the 'superpowers' weren't enough to overrule the deep depression, and growing anxiety, and vulnerability I am starting to feel.\n\nTo add on to what you are saying, this depression and anxiety is coming from me coming to terms with the fact that I just ripped out the core thing that has been there for me all these years. Whether I was stressed, happy, scared, upset, and any emotion, PMO was always there for me. Then, I had to learn that my core was bad, and that I now have to deal with it. I think this started hitting me around day 120. \n\nI completely agree with soulcreams comments about filling it with things, but how do you fill that which was so vast? I have taken up gym, yoga, cooking, and nothing seems to be able to feel the emptiness I feel now without PMO. \n\nI do not feel like my superpowers are 'gone', just that they are being overruled by the void that quitting PMO has left, some days are better than others, but at least half of my days are a constant battle with myself, fighting for something I know I can achieve but knowing how hard the journey is, it is so hard to keep going. Most days I barely have the energy. Others are much better.\n\nI think you are correct - the only way to combat this is slow steps, steadfastness, and fighting back just as hard when your brain is being relentless to try to get you to mood alter and fap. Eventually, my hope is my brain will rewire itself to combat this naturally, and I will have filled my void with better things. \n\nThanks again for your post.\n\nAlso I feel like those that feel this is too negative - I disagree. This is exactly what NoFap needs - realism. Not all these people who hit that first, second, or third euphorias of finally being in control of their lives, and then go and post about it. Not all those who made it past this stage this post is about, and then posted. But those who are in THIS reality the post is describing, and dealing with it. It is a dark place, and it needs to be brought to light that this can happen.

I was writing about my experience closing in on 90 days last night and I wanted to touch on some of the downsides but couldn't think quite how to put them into words. I think you've done a good job at that here. \n\nStill, some of your downsides are also upsides depending on perspective. The increased sense of vulnerability, for instance, is something I've felt as well, but I don't see this as a downside as much as I see it as a return to a more healthy emotional state. Because having that increased sensitivity and awareness to my feelings has also helped me to connect with people socially and in more meaningful ways. \n\nAlso, the major depression that accompanied my PMO addiction was far worse than the minor depressiveness that sometimes comes up now that I've abstained for a while. When I was more majorly depressed it was easier for me to make bad decisions from a 'fuck it, who cares' standpoint or otherwise 'eh I'm already fucked, it doesn't matter' or other apathetic and nihilistic views. For example, a habit I used to have that accompanied PMO was getting fast food late at night, coming home, watching a movie, watching porn, masturbating and crashing to sleep at like 2 or 3am. Since NoFap, I haven't done anything like that. It's been easier for me to go to bed at a better hour and the few occasions I've been up past 1am and thought about going to grab a burger it's been easier to resist that urge as well.\n\nWhile it's true I still get down on myself sometimes, it's less despair than it was and I have a better framework for identifying why I'm feeling down and doing something about it. Which was all but impossible in the past. \n\nThe big one though that I agree with is the sense of being lost a bit. Which I think is attributable to the fact that as helpful as NoFap can be, it is ultimately only one thing and can't rewrite your life on its own. Accomplishing it feels good and all but that doesn't mean there isn't more work to be done elsewhere. But some of those other challenges might not be as straightforward to identify or pursue. \n\nComing out of an addiction is a great thing, but just being at a point where 'okay, can live life' isn't necessarily enough if you still don't have something to focus on. \n\nStill though, while that is a negative and all, it's vastly preferable to the alternative. \n\n", "id": "dawz247"}, {"comment": "Yeah, fighting addiction is never pretty.

You have no idea how helpful this is, you put into words what I have been trying to explain to myself and my support group. This is EXACTLY how I feel. All I ever read on NoFap is everyone posting how amazing it feels. I also felt that, but now i'm entering into a phase (i'm at 141 days) where suddenly without realizing it, I realized the 'superpowers' weren't enough to overrule the deep depression, and growing anxiety, and vulnerability I am starting to feel.\n\nTo add on to what you are saying, this depression and anxiety is coming from me coming to terms with the fact that I just ripped out the core thing that has been there for me all these years. Whether I was stressed, happy, scared, upset, and any emotion, PMO was always there for me. Then, I had to learn that my core was bad, and that I now have to deal with it. I think this started hitting me around day 120. \n\nI completely agree with soulcreams comments about filling it with things, but how do you fill that which was so vast? I have taken up gym, yoga, cooking, and nothing seems to be able to feel the emptiness I feel now without PMO. \n\nI do not feel like my superpowers are 'gone', just that they are being overruled by the void that quitting PMO has left, some days are better than others, but at least half of my days are a constant battle with myself, fighting for something I know I can achieve but knowing how hard the journey is, it is so hard to keep going. Most days I barely have the energy. Others are much better.\n\nI think you are correct - the only way to combat this is slow steps, steadfastness, and fighting back just as hard when your brain is being relentless to try to get you to mood alter and fap. Eventually, my hope is my brain will rewire itself to combat this naturally, and I will have filled my void with better things. \n\nThanks again for your post.\n\nAlso I feel like those that feel this is too negative - I disagree. This is exactly what NoFap needs - realism. Not all these people who hit that first, second, or third euphorias of finally being in control of their lives, and then go and post about it. Not all those who made it past this stage this post is about, and then posted. But those who are in THIS reality the post is describing, and dealing with it. It is a dark place, and it needs to be brought to light that this can happen. Maybe not to all - some may have better ways of coping, some may not have been addicts for as long so the 'ripping out and leaving a void' may not be as big, but this is real and I cannot imagine we are the only ones who have to go through this.", "id": "dayahw5"}, {"comment": "I'm glad you've made it this far.

Now its like \"How can I fix this\"\n\nSo question for OP, would you agree that the demotivated feeling of being overwhelmed has left or did you struggle with that too??\n\nHonestly this may sound bullshit but all those feelings I get, even the hardening ones, I love it.

He needs to take a piss, goes to the restroom. While he is pissing $5 fall out of his pocket into the urinal. Another guy sees this ans says: \"You won't pick that up, will you?\" The drunk guy pulls out his wallet, takes $50 out, throws the bill intentionally into the urinal, answers: \"I won't get my hands dirty for $5, but I will for $55!\" and takes his money.\n\nNoFap adds the $50 bill.

They had been inspired by the French impressionists and their students who had made bold choices in subject matter and painting style decades earlier. You see, painting was an art ruled by the Academy. It was governed by rules. For example, the size of the canvas was dictated by the subject matter. Large, epic histories were put on giant canvases.\n\nWhat does Picasso do? He places a modern war scene on that type of canvas. He gives the Civil War in Spain the same importance as hundreds of images of the wars of antiquity. Picasso is using some of the aspects of classical painting but he subverts it and makes it modern. \n\nAnyways that's just one reason. But Picasso really is interesting to learn about.

I'm in the same boat as you. I do think consuming large quantities of porn is extremely negative for an individual but masturbating is not the devil it is made out to be.\n\nFor example, a scroll through the evolutionary biology literature reveals some interesting motivations for masturbating such as sperm regulation particularly when a man will masturbate a few days before he expects to have sex. Just to give an example. Would this be applicable to this context though? Probably not.\n\nI would agree that there is something deeper going on. This link between no longer fapping and 'being a better person' is correlational. The likelihood is that having a cheeky wank from time to time won't kill you. Potentially, and I would need to look this up (points for anyone with a source), excessive behaviour such as frequent masturbation is a symptom of other issues rather than a cause. I would say that at most it is cyclical and that going completely clean is not a completely life changing event other than a positive step in the right direction which might then have a knock on effect.

It can take some people a long time to open up.\n\nWho are you really disappointed at? This sub never promised any one of us anything. It's not a magic answer that will fix problems. It's a guide that will allow us to recognize we have a problem, and then investigate and do the hard work on our own.\n\nThere are plenty of people here willing to help you understand the underlying causes of your addiction, but that truly is a journey for you and you alone.

But it is hardly enough to get me started. Really, fapping has always been a way out of problems I could not even hope of overcoming, while I have yet to see anything positive out of NoFap. Naturally I am bitter.\n\nAs for expectations, I'll admit the many 'superpower' posts here have inflated my expectations (and really have been quite detrimental).", "id": "d87gxgs"}, {"comment": "I understand that feeling! It's a tough one, a very illusory feeling (the monster seems huge but is truly a mouse,) but one that can nonetheless strip you of your power to change if you feed into it too much. I think we all have done this to varying degrees.\n\nMindfulness is a powerful practice for healing anxiety, depression, and similar maladies of the brain. It is helpful because it allows us to detach from our feelings and stop \"being them\", and to start feeling them, which allows them to pass. Feelings are transient, they come and go. Beliefs are built up, and if they're fed enough they stay for quite awhile, and it will take some time to let them shrink and leave.\n\nI know little about you, but based on what I know about my own addiction and what you've written it seems that you've created a storyline in your head in which things have happened and you've felt powerless to change them. You might feel like you've missed out on a lot, and that probably makes it even harder to shift your mindset and be a little more forgiving and kind to yourself. I can relate to that! If you're anything like the rest of us, you shame yourself and beat yourself up in your head. \"What's wrong with me?\" \"Why are they doing what I can't?\" \"Will I be like this forever?\" Questions like these fuel that part of your brain which drives this feeling, as they make you feel more fearful and ashamed, which creates an even greater need to hide and protect the self. A vicious cycle.\n\nIt's important to learn to embrace all aspects of your mind and your being as one, integrated unit. I like to think of the brain as many different people working together as a team. There is \"you\", the conscious, thinking, decision-making part of your brain (prefrontal cortex) and the many other parts which regulate your emotions, your energy, your fight/flight state, etc. I'm not particularly well versed in neurology so sorry if I'm butchering this. Just like in real life, this brain team experiences dysfunction from time to time. Sometimes imbalances are created by a lack of awareness and struggles in life married with a lack of support from parents, family, or friends. One part of the brain will become more powerful than the others (because we choose, knowingly or not, to focus on it) and thus begins disintegration of the brain. All parts are not on the same page, no longer working together. Certain parts of the brain will feel outcasted, not heard, and this may manifest itself as anger, bitterness, and resentment. A part of your brain may learn to escape from a feeling through a certain behavior, and it does this because it wants to protect you. It believes you are not capable of dealing with whatever you're dealing with, and so it shields you. This is an important function of the brain, because perhaps at some point we were not ready to confront or process something in our life. The problem that so many of us face arises when we are unable to rebound from this state of protection, and become stuck. Addicts all feel powerless to their addictions, and their addictions often stem from events or an upbringing in which they felt powerless, it's no coincidence! It's yet another vicious, self-reinforcing cycle. When you submit to an addiction the part of your brain that is witness to everything happening becomes disillusioned and disappointed in itself, often this manifests itself as shame in the form of the previously mentioned questions.\n\nMindfulness provides us with perspective which addicts so desperately lack when within the throes of their habits, and even after choosing to quit, which is why relapses occur! I've known for years I needed to quit, but I lacked the awareness to do it mindfully and effectively. I was stuck in my anger and bitterness, I was honestly a bit entitled, and I wasn't taking full responsibility for my life. I blamed my past, which I was stuck in. Mindfulness allowed me to be present in the here and now, and not be so stuck in my history, or the fear of my future. There's a saying that goes: \"I had one foot in the past, and one foot in the future... and I was pissing all over the present.\"\n\nBy learning to allow our feelings to pass, shame loses it's grips over us. We can more objectively (though never fully) understand our feelings and learn to be more compassionate and understanding towards that fearful part of ourselves that wishes to shield us from discomfort and suffering, and open ourselves up to the pain we were suppressing. It's been proven on a physical level that the size of a human's prefrontal cortex can change with meditation and mindfulness exercises.\n\nHuman beings are not born with this knowledge innately, it is learned and developed from our role models, our teachers, our peers, but primarily our parents. I know that I personally learned a lot of my anxious, overthinking, worrying and fearful behaviors from mine! But I don't blame them. They did the best they could.\n\nIt is tough to have expectations crushed, but I would argue that's not necessarily detrimental. Not all painful things work against your favor; many of them serve to help you grow and become stronger. Change is never easy, and never comfortable. That is one of the hardest truths to accept, and one I am still understanding myself.\n\nYou're only 25. I understand how you feel, but I truly think you're in a very fortunate spot to have realized all of these things at such a young age. I believe many discover much, MUCH later in life that there was a lot they were hiding from themselves, and plenty more who never discover it at all in their lifetimes. You have an opportunity others haven't had. Remember to be grateful, it will balance out your feelings of negativity and powerlessness. We all live in our own, self-created universe. You're the god of yours; you choose what to build and what to destroy! What you focus on in yourself, and in others, is what will exist in your world. The world you see, the way you choose to see people, is a mirror image of yourself. This won't be easy, and you won't always succeed, so be easy on yourself! \n\nHope this helps!

Furthermore not all women are blessed with good looks at birth. Frankly put some women are ugly and fat. And that effects how people treat them in their daily life. Even very attractive women feel a lot of pressure to uphold their appearance. More men are homeless than women because women can be in relationships where they don't have to be the breadwinner. But for women who are actually homeless, life is hell. They are constantly  harassed and live with the fear of being raped. Moreover, women don't give men a lot of validation because they have to be more selective than us. A man can have sex with a chick and flee the country as soon as he knows she's pregnant.

And i for one enjoy getting to meet the people behind the screen - we have to accept that THEY accepted. That people will see them in a sexual way.

Infact some pornstars even - consider someone fapping to them a sign of \"respect\". Or basically a compliment. Which i mean it's kind of true.

THIS is why fights and hostility exist. Because people will always have it better than other people. So what are the people who have it worse off supposed to do? Accept it? Work harder at it? Or, be angry at how bullshit it is.\n\nLet me tell you hwhat. Accepting it and being a fucking pleb is the WORST way to go. Working at it is good, but guess what, if you were born fugly or got fucked up and are now handicap. Guess what, no amount of \"hard work\" will fix that. Now anger. Anger EVERYONE can get behind. Because its anger, everyone can do it, and its easy to do. Personally I used to blame the world. But I realize its my own fault for not improving myself. But the world sure as shit wasn't helpful either, because as he says NO ONE CARES, and ya WE as people who WANT others to care keep reinforcing the idea NOBODY cares, how LITERALLY insane is that?\n\nIts the snowball effect. The hardest thing about the snowball effect is stopping it. I mean some of us are on a 45 degree slope at the beginning of winter. Others are on a 85 degree slope in a blizzard. Ok, if you went from example A to B ya it is your fault for letting it get this far. But, it is not all your fault for it getting this far, just not slowing it down or stopping it before it got this far, even then depending on circumstance. Yet it IS all on you to stop it because unless you have large amounts of money you can't \"fix it\" alone once it has gotten too far, this of course is a paradox, because you need help at that point but oh wait \"nobody cares\" remember? So ya lets stop saying this \"nobody cares\" shit, you just need to find people who do care, and who you care for. Honestly its insane how we only do this for a handful of people when EVERYONE needs this. But I digress.\n\nI will use dating and relationships as an example. I am balding. It could be worse, I could also, you know, not be fucking balding. This started at 19....I am 22. I was laid once, first time was this year. She was flabby and had the sagging tits of a grandma and was only 28. She also smelled really bad if I turned her around. I literally asked if she had taken a shower before hand she said she did but fuck that smell.\n\nI regret it. I mean at least I could check virgin off but it was just ew IMO. \nI had a goal to get laid by a cougar and a hot young girl. (My plans have changed to a young girl that isn't overweight).\nIt is literally ridiculous to me how disproportionate female body and male body types are. All these young guys are either skinny or buff. While all women are either rounded or very rounded...(at least in my area).\n\nAnyway the thing is. I can't change that I am balding. They can change their weight. I was actually getting kind of fat but I slimmed down because I changed my diet, I no longer drink a fucking soda a day or junk food for all 3 meals. But you know who I do see do that? My female coworkers and all the other large women. It is like. Jesus, you want prince charming but you won't fix yourself first? \n\nThis greatly enrages me because i apparently have a death sentence in the \"getting laid\" department because of my hair. It really does look like shit. It looks only slightly better than that meme called \"fuck my shit up\". This really does turn off a lot of girls. Because when asked why they don't find me attractive they literally say \"IDK its just, something about you\". Mind you they aren't really hiding anything I have been a dick and they have said \"its cause you are a dick\" but when i go pure neutral its like \"oohhh its just SOMETHING\". Ya no its the fucking hair I get it. Im 22 and I look like im recovering from chemo or something at the age of 40.\n\nI was actually told by a girl when I was around 19 \"hey you look mature for your age\". I was caught off guard like \"huh?\". I realize now in hindsight, it was because I had a receding hairline... So ya its noticeable but without analyzing it, they just go \"its something\". Usually the girls 24 and up say \"I see your thinning hairline\". As a jab for being interested in them. \n\nI mean have you ever talked to or visited a premature hairloss person (or community). I visited a forum and I could FEEL the depression ooze from the words, it was...depressing. So here is the thing. I mean holy fuck there is a show called \"man seeking woman\" and one of the episodes LITERALLY had THIS\n\nIs this fixable? Yes, it totally is, can I get laid with a hot girl. Totally. But to \"fix\" my situation, I have to have motivation and a means to do so. Besides my looks, my life is also kind of shit. I have a shitty job and struggling to get an education. \n\nNow if you read that, you could say \"looks like you need to fix yourself before finding your princess\". Ya I agree, thing is I am not looking for my princess. I am looking for two experiences and cannot have them because society and genetics have told me \"no\".\nSo I get angry. Cause and effect people. And the people who demonize people for falling victim to cause and effect, well. You can remove a rib and suck your own dick before telling ME to \"suck it up\" because let me let you in on a little secret. IT IS OK TO BE ANGRY. The world is unfair, we all hear this. But apparently we are supposed to just go full retard and smile and drool through the rest of our lives because \"duhhh can't do nuttin bouts it\". No.\n\nIf you got thrown to the ground and beat up would you start feeling pain or would you need to wait to be told \"Hey you are getting hit, you can say ouch now\". No, you would feel pain. After you got beat up and are still in pain, how would you like it if someone came up and said \"Ya that is normal you get used to it\". Would you just say \"oh ok\". If you do, fuck you. Cause the right answer would be \"WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT ABOUT THOSE GUYS BEATING ME UP, WHY DIDN'T THEY HAVE ANY BRUISES?\" "], [10, "\"That some guy can walk into a room and women gravitate toward him\"\n\n\"You walk into a room and no one talks to you. Think about this for a second. Why should they? What makes you different from other men?\"\n\nWhat exactly make the good looking guy different?  Because he is good looking? Whats so special about him?  His good looks?  That's not a totally shallow, and conceited way to be.\n\nI know a few good looking guys who are total fucking losers.

THIS is why fights and hostility exist. Because people will always have it better than other people. So what are the people who have it worse off supposed to do? Accept it? Work harder at it? Or, be angry at how bullshit it is.\n\nLet me tell you hwhat. Accepting it and being a fucking pleb is the WORST way to go. Working at it is good, but guess what, if you were born fugly or got fucked up and are now handicap. Guess what, no amount of \"hard work\" will fix that. Now anger. Anger EVERYONE can get behind. Because its anger, everyone can do it, and its easy to do. Personally I used to blame the world. But I realize its my own fault for not improving myself. But the world sure as shit wasn't helpful either, because as he says NO ONE CARES, and ya WE as people who WANT others to care keep reinforcing the idea NOBODY cares, how LITERALLY insane is that?\n\nIts the snowball effect. The hardest thing about the snowball effect is stopping it. I mean some of us are on a 45 degree slope at the beginning of winter. Others are on a 85 degree slope in a blizzard. Ok, if you went from example A to B ya it is your fault for letting it get this far. But, it is not all your fault for it getting this far, just not slowing it down or stopping it before it got this far, even then depending on circumstance. Yet it IS all on you to stop it because unless you have large amounts of money you can't \"fix it\" alone once it has gotten too far, this of course is a paradox, because you need help at that point but oh wait \"nobody cares\" remember? So ya lets stop saying this \"nobody cares\" shit, you just need to find people who do care, and who you care for. Honestly its insane how we only do this for a handful of people when EVERYONE needs this. But I digress.\n\nI will use dating and relationships as an example. I am balding. It could be worse, I could also, you know, not be fucking balding. This started at 19....I am 22. I was laid once, first time was this year. She was flabby and had the sagging tits of a grandma and was only 28. She also smelled really bad if I turned her around. I literally asked if she had taken a shower before hand she said she did but fuck that smell.\n\nI regret it. I mean at least I could check virgin off but it was just ew IMO. \nI had a goal to get laid by a cougar and a hot young girl. (My plans have changed to a young girl that isn't overweight).\nIt is literally ridiculous to me how disproportionate female body and male body types are. All these young guys are either skinny or buff. While all women are either rounded or very rounded...(at least in my area).\n\nAnyway the thing is. I can't change that I am balding. They can change their weight. I was actually getting kind of fat but I slimmed down because I changed my diet, I no longer drink a fucking soda a day or junk food for all 3 meals. But you know who I do see do that? My female coworkers and all the other large women. It is like. Jesus, you want prince charming but you won't fix yourself first? \n\nThis greatly enrages me because i apparently have a death sentence in the \"getting laid\" department because of my hair. It really does look like shit. It looks only slightly better than that meme called \"fuck my shit up\". This really does turn off a lot of girls. Because when asked why they don't find me attractive they literally say \"IDK its just, something about you\". Mind you they aren't really hiding anything I have been a dick and they have said \"its cause you are a dick\" but when i go pure neutral its like \"oohhh its just SOMETHING\". Ya no its the fucking hair I get it. Im 22 and I look like im recovering from chemo or something at the age of 40.\n\nI was actually told by a girl when I was around 19 \"hey you look mature for your age\". I was caught off guard like \"huh?\". I realize now in hindsight, it was because I had a receding hairline... So ya its noticeable but without analyzing it, they just go \"its something\". Usually the girls 24 and up say \"I see your thinning hairline\". As a jab for being interested in them. \n\nI mean have you ever talked to or visited a premature hairloss person (or community). I visited a forum and I could FEEL the depression ooze from the words, it was...depressing. So here is the thing. I mean holy fuck there is a show called \"man seeking woman\" and one of the episodes LITERALLY had THIS\n\nIs this fixable? Yes, it totally is, can I get laid with a hot girl. Totally. But to \"fix\" my situation, I have to have motivation and a means to do so. Besides my looks, my life is also kind of shit. I have a shitty job and struggling to get an education. \n\nNow if you read that, you could say \"looks like you need to fix yourself before finding your princess\". Ya I agree, thing is I am not looking for my princess. I am looking for two experiences and cannot have them because society and genetics have told me \"no\".\nSo I get angry.

Yeah, tons of women fall for the good looks... initially. From me personally, I could talk to girls and I could tell right away they were attracted, lucky me right? Wrong, I was boring. Anything more than a couple one night stands and girls were over me. Looks create an initial attraction, everything else is what keeps them around. Wanna know why that guy has a smoking hot wife? Because he's smoking hot at something besides being good looking. I'm another note, he likely doesn't see women or men in the same way as the complainers do, he values people for what they weren't given at birth, for what they've achieved through trial and error. \n\nWomen are attracted to value and value can come from almost anywhere. Different women value different things more. Different gorgeous women value different things more. Dating is a numbers game. Sure good looking might cut out a couple of steps, but a lot of times being good looking leads to girls hanging around guys they don't actually like.

Let's get real.  I am bisexual and our men are no different than them but you all look like clones.  And those SJW hogs and creepy hetero bitches who look at us like we are in need of a psychic reading and both sides of your creeper crew us just bullshit.\n\nIn fact, encourage them so people will do things rather than attack.  I fell for a guy when I was in my 20s who was like my partner in crime and we were both hardass bisexuals at a martial arts tournament where I took  and we ended up in drama in my early because two straight girls... your ilk... came up trying to hit on us and nah, we were monogamous.  The miscarriage prior killed me and she's with the same woman too.  But we said we were both bisexual and going to pound town together.  Well this was near a mall so three of your pride sisters came in with the lispy shit calling us gay and was ignored them but told her, \"you cannot mentally grasp us, it is like fucking a retarded person and we are in love with each other, we are also capable and very attracted to women\".  So one got mad, called 5 out of shape redneck to get us \"queers trying to say they're bi\" and we said tell them we'll be waiting and we took them out one by one.  I didn't like the spectacle that came with it since I see gay men as different outside of the legal protection under the term LGBT (Legally).\n\nCrushing their ego while at the same time feeding their delusional egos which are a lot like yours by sending out the idea that gay (and by default bi men) check out straight man after straight man... because those sick fucks disrespect us thinking they are safe trying to cop head and shit.  Really, I have a lot of good friends and they get ruined over that idea.\n\nLooks is something that hasn't been an issue for me, men or women.  However, I was outed as bi at age 8 and we were still catholics until I was 13 and my mom was a radical separatist feminist lesbian after... michfest every year... anti porn...

Because I'm not a self absorbed dickbag.  I'll go into a bar or club and look around, find the most attractive woman that's sitting alone, and I'll walk up and talk to her. And you know what? 90% of the time they're *very* grateful for it because every other guy has either been too scared or some affliction shirt wearing douche that calls everyone \"brah\", and she's been bored out of her damn mind, and because of that gratitude and the fact that I'm not a mouth breather, I get a chance that I might not otherwise get with a woman like her if I just approached her on the street (btw, protip, don't EVER do that. Women hate that shit. If you're not in a place where \"meeting people\" is socially acceptable, they're probably not in the mindset of someone that wants to be approached by a stranger with a romantic or sexual advance), a chance I make the most out of by keeping her laughing, and asking questions about her that aren't TOO personal (you don't want to ask questions that are probing too much into where she lives or works, etc. She may think you're going to turn into a stalker) and then at the end of the evening, ask for whatever contact info she's comfortable with giving, and part ways.  Almost every time it has lead to dating, sex, or both.

This nofap community specifically addresses just one of those paths of empty sexuality, arguably one of the most obviously destructive.

However, I challenge you guys who think that way to question why you think that way.  Until recently, sexuality was a taboo set upon by a religious majority.  Then, people started to question and rebel against it and have gone to the opposite extreme.  Perhaps that extreme is indoctrinating us much in the same way that the religious majority indoctrinated us a century ago.  Perhaps we think that casual sex is fulfilling because society and the media tells us it is.  What if they're wrong?\n\nNofap is a journey.  An exercise in self discipline and improvement.

The reality is that your mind just does what it does.  You don't lose your senses, you can still speak factually about things that happen to you - it simply becomes your experience that you are not, in any *real* way the sum of said events.  The path of advaita vedanta is a slightly different one than that of monks - the premise is that the truth is ever present, and that practice is secondary to that which might be easily seen. The fact is, you yourself have made good progress on this path just by saying \"nothing wrong with my personality being composed of human invention\".  Your ability not to more strongly identify with your minds composition as something more basically inherent is good.  But I have to agree with letting the void be.

They are way more in the moment, and way less consistent. One minute they love you and the other they hate you. \n\nThey're also way more controlled by their emotions. One minute they're happy and they want to do great things with you, and a minute later they think you're the devil and want to cry.\n\nI don't think they are dumber, they're just 'simpler' in day-to-day life. They make small problems bigger and get caught up in the details, while men often don't pay attention to details at all, so it's a nice balance. \n\nOverall, I think it's pretty telling that 90% of all inventions we are currently communicating through and using, are made my men. \n\nNow, I think women are not dumber, but different, a counterweight to our leadership and tendency to be 'better', and to our lack of details or subtlety. \n\n> can not be good friends and colleagues\n\nThey can absolutely be.

Imo, a bad PMO addiction can be just as bad as smoking.  Yes, smoking will eventually kill you, physically.

So I know how bad smoking is, trust me.   Nevertheless, the resilience of some people astound me despite what happens to them physically.\n\nHowever, the cases that always breaks my heart are those in which the patient gets destroyed emotionally, mentally  (even spiritually). PMO is not very different in that it can kill you emotionally and mentally.  It can suck your life dry just like how depression and alcoholism can.  In some ways, it can be 100% worse than smoking because the mental aspects run profoundly deeper.  \n\nSo don't discount how bad this condition can be.  Do I think PMO is physically bad (in a neurological sense persay)? Maybe - who knows?.  I mean PMO still isn't even considered a real addiction. This is especially true in medicine.  Psychiatrist and doctors will give you weird looks for even wondering about it (in fact I still wonder if it meets the right criteria myself).

As it stands there is no sound evidence that masturbation is unhealthy and the strongest argument that can be made is that its only unhealthy in excess which is true of just about everything. The current medical consensus opinion on the matter is that masturbation is a normal and healthy part of sexual developmental maturity and adult sexualtiy.

Stopping masturbation is more of a means to an end rather than being bad within itself.  I believe others can back me up on this.\n\nAnd don't think this 100% pseudoscience either.

So i want to start of by saying thank u to u for taking your time to orginze and write such a personal story and dedicating it to us nofappers.\nU have my highest respect. \n\nIts funny, that i started my nofap jounrey a month ago by watching the same video that u mentioned and then found this group and never pmo'ed again since then. Never relapsed. Today is my day 32,  and the only way i survived this long without fapping is because i come and read this subreddit everyday. Posted two stories myself. And seeing other people success and the shame from relapses,  gives me strength to fight every urge that i get.   \nToday i was feeling a little low, off day from work, home alone after a long time, ffamily went abroad for vacation, gf went abroad to work for 10 months. And i was bored and had a deep urge to view porn and was fighting it really hard. Gave a lot of pushups but its still there.  And believe me when i say after reading ur story, it completely went away, that's why i keep coming back here.  And I'm sure it will help tons of other nofap brothers of mine. \nYOU, my dear lady, is a Rockstar now. Motivating and helping us get better. We r mostly doing this for oitselves. But at the end of the day, we r doing it for you too. Cause i have never loved my gf anymore than i do now. And it keeps growing everyday and she notices that and tells me everyday too. And my view on the female kind have changed totally and i can see that they notice it while i walk outside mypsef. \n\nI'll pray that u find peace,  and I'm sure you will get it. As u r smart, i say that cause u r on the right track now.  \nP.s sorry for making it too wordy. Your story really moved me"], [18, "Wow. For someone who used live camming as a means of porn, this really really resonates with me. Every time I did it, there was always a voice in my head telling me how meaningless this was, how much the women probably hate doing it. You can see it in their eyes. I hated myself for using it when I did, because there was nothing more to it than objectifying that woman on the screen and telling her what I wanted her to do. I'm so glad I gave it up and finally my morals have taken over those nasty triggers. \n\nWhat makes me even more sad about your story is that there's probably many girls out there right now in the same situation with no way out or who think it'll get better or they're so mentally debilitated camming is all they know now. \n\n You're so awesome for giving it up and looking to better yourself.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. Seriously. It's a story like this that will help me get through the day porn-free."], [12, "I've been visiting this subreddit for a few years now and this is one of the only stories that has truly struck a chord with me and gotten me to emotionally tear up.\n\nFirst and foremost, thank you so much for displaying such exceptional courage and bravery in sharing your story. Your decision to be forthright and candid helps to offer insight into the industry and can serve to turn people away form it. Lately, the damage that porn does is the main factor that's keeping me away from it, but I'm not focusing much on the damage it does to me anymore (anxiety, stress, lack of confidence, etc.) but more so, the awful toll it takes on the participants, particularly the actresses.\n\nSo many stories are just like yours. Great, wonderful, beautiful innocent girls who need some extra money or happen to find themselves in bleak life circumstances and start camming or agree to a quick shoot and within a few months or a bit more, they're getting abused on a set and hooked on opiates. It tears my heart apart when I hear of these stories because *women are people* and all pornography does is perpetuate the notion that they are object which exists solely for men's pleasure. \n\nI find modern feminism's vociferous endorsement of pornography as \"liberation\" and \"equality\" to be horrendously warped and frustratingly misguided. Pornography merely encourages men to continue to view women as objects and nothing more. This awful shit trains a human to exploit other people and see them only as a means to an end. Like Pope John Paul II said, \"There is no dignity when the human dimension is eliminated from the person. In short, the problem with pornography is not that it shows too much of the person, but that it shows far too little.\" Regardless of personal religious beliefs, this statement is mind-bogglingly accurate. Immersed in pornography, we lose sight of the dignity, beauty and essence of each individual. All we care about is ourselves. We are willing to do whatever it takes to experience our pleasure, despite what another person is being forced to endure. I've seen some truly sick and depressing pornographic scenes and looking back on them now, I feel so much sadness, pity and pain for the women who were forced to participate in some of the awful, demoralizing and reprehensible content.\n\nSociety alleges that porn is healthy (bullshit, the desensitization and other problems it causes are far, far from healthy) and lies to us, saying that it's about \"expression\" and \"freedom.\" I am reminded of a story where a Buddhist man entered a monastery for 30 days and couldn't speak one word, had no sexual activity, ate and drank just enough to survive, was forced to endure harsh temperature/climate conditions and didn't sleep on a bed. When he returned, his good friend couldn't believe he would voluntarily submit to something like that and asked him why he would give up all of his freedoms. The Buddhist man smiled and said, \"Give up my freedoms? My friend, it was only when I was in the monastery there that I was truly free. I was free from desire. Free from the prison of seeking food or sex or all pleasures. Free from needing to speak, free from needing the temperature to be set at a perfect level. You see, it was only in abandoning all of my desires and the things which controlled me that truly permitted me to be free. Liberation is freedom from attachment. I am more free when I give up these things because I am not a slave to them.\"\n\nThank you so much for sharing your story, and for encouraging all of us. We are not perfect, but we strive every day to be. I don't know if I will ever fully overcome this addiction and be done with it forever, but I know that I can make it today and your post helped immensely.

Wondering what kind of lifestyles it will lead to, what dark hell-pit we'll end up in and if there is time to avoid that dystopian future.\n\nSexuality is such a weird thing!  It's scary and fascinating that sexual arousal can be piggy-backed on violence and desire for power.  It can basically be co-opted by other drives and lead us down a very bad path, or, alternatively, it can be closely tied to deep feelings of love and connection.  Bringing true joy and intimacy or striking disconnect and pain.  It's no wonder religions the world over have striven to protect sexuality from debasement.  Sorry for the rant.

As we can see in this subreddit it is very obvious that mens relationship to sex is very much an addiction. The kick of seeing a naked woman doing nasty stuff. You produced and sold the drug that they craved. You tried to find other ways of making your shows more interesting and hence pay more. (Stronger drugs). \n\nI'm not saying that you are not a victim but these men are not sleazy predators.  They are addicted to the drug that the sex and porn industry is selling. You contributed to it but now you are out which is good for you and for them. Unfortunately there will always be more.\n\nSaying who is empowered or not is pretty complex.  You needed money they needed a fix. You provided them with their fix and got paid in return. Just your normal drugdealer client interaction. \n\nI'm not blaming you or saying you did something bad but I'm just tiered of the view that men are always the empowered or predators. Society needs to understand male sexuality better and maybe not allow for companies to exploit that.\n\nEverybody has their own choice. Even drug addicts.  Sometimes it's good if we all create a world where it's easy to make the good choices and hard to make the bad ones.\n\nI'm glad you got out of it and good luck with your future journey in nofap."], [3, "Thanks so much for sharing.

It is incredible in a world where there is a lot of talk about racism, saving environment, saving tigers and what not, yet there is so much misogyny in the world. \n\nI grew with a different sort of problem where somehow I always viewed women as a higher authority, and always put them on the pedestal, and somehow I thought I was doing the right thing. After all who wouldn't want to be admired and adored, right. [Of course I was wrong].This was much before I watched porn, and I have seen a therapist for this and realized that I can't really change this.\n\nOf course, no woman wants this, to be put on a pedestal and worshipped. It would always kill any attraction I could think of developing. I thought I was the better person for just wanting an emotional connection with a women, where everyone just wanted to  use them for sex.\n\nWhen I watched porn for the first time, it literally broke my heart to see girls treated this way. For me, it was like the authority I worshipped was being abused and where did that leave me. I felt weak, inferior and like the lowest person in the whole world. \n\nI did use cam websites but only to ask girls to abuse me for the pathetic person I was, and yet I noticed while every girl had no problem taking clothes, they had real problem if I asked them to humiliate me. \n\nFinally I came here and on a long recovery road towards becoming a normal person. I am not sure if I ever will be able to attract a girl because of my innate desire to be dominated by a woman, but I'll just try to become the best person I could be.

May be if I could only believe in myself a bit, I could be so much better.\n\nBut this is about you, I wish you the best.

I was jst about to go to sleep, and by the force of habit i came back to the subreddit. And saw ur post is getting viral. 300+ upvotes and noticed u started replying everyone one by one. And i was two comments down. And i had a feeling that u would write to me soon. So i kept refreshing and refreshing , until u did. Felt like winning a lottery.hehehe\nAnd since u said u like big post, please allow me to say a little more. \nI'm 27, from Bangladesh, currently living in china. And my gf is Chinese, been with her for 1.5years. Both of us read your story and your reply(i forwarded ur story immediately after reading and a screen shot after ur reply). And we are thoroughly moved. \nI was never known to be punctual, and strong minded. And couldnot  hold on to any hard decision for long if i made any. I feel the only reason i was able to keep up this streak for such a long time without breaking is only because of this subreddit, and for my fellow Fapstrounts and stories like yours. It helps so much when u r a part of such an amazing community who is dedicated only to help each other when u r down and praise u when u do something right and then there is the overall benifts of becoming a better person at every aspect of your life.My relationship with my family and gf got sooo much sweeter, My business went up in a month, now moving to another business field, i own an English school and now moving into international trade. Entirely different field, super scary, but still going for it cause i feel i have the confidence to do anything now. All this was possible  because of this nofap group. This place is absolutely magical for me . And I'm getting the feeling that u r feeling it too right abt now as people r going crazy for ur story!!!!\n\n  The reason i say all this is because i hope if u come back here once in a while, i think u can get motivated and get all the help you need to become the person u were when u were pure and innocent. Take whatever Pain u received, to fuel your drive and become an icon like the way u r right now in all our nofappers heart. Don't be afraid of ur past. Whatever happened , happened. Accept it and let it go and I've so much faith in u, I'm sure u will do great. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels the same this way. \n\nNow i gotta go sleep as its 1am here in china.

Your decision to be forthright and candid helps to offer insight into the industry and can serve to turn people away form it. Lately, the damage that porn does is the main factor that's keeping me away from it, but I'm not focusing much on the damage it does to me anymore (anxiety, stress, lack of confidence, etc.) but more so, the awful toll it takes on the participants, particularly the actresses.\n\nSo many stories are just like yours. Great, wonderful, beautiful innocent girls who need some extra money or happen to find themselves in bleak life circumstances and start camming or agree to a quick shoot and within a few months or a bit more, they're getting abused on a set and hooked on opiates. It tears my heart apart when I hear of these stories because *women are people* and all pornography does is perpetuate the notion that they are object which exists solely for men's pleasure. \n\nI find modern feminism's vociferous endorsement of pornography as \"liberation\" and \"equality\" to be horrendously warped and frustratingly misguided. Pornography merely encourages men to continue to view women as objects and nothing more. This awful shit trains a human to exploit other people and see them only as a means to an end. Like Pope John Paul II said, \"There is no dignity when the human dimension is eliminated from the person. In short, the problem with pornography is not that it shows too much of the person, but that it shows far too little.\" Regardless of personal religious beliefs, this statement is mind-bogglingly accurate. Immersed in pornography, we lose sight of the dignity, beauty and essence of each individual. All we care about is ourselves. We are willing to do whatever it takes to experience our pleasure, despite what another person is being forced to endure. I've seen some truly sick and depressing pornographic scenes and looking back on them now, I feel so much sadness, pity and pain for the women who were forced to participate in some of the awful, demoralizing and reprehensible content.\n\nSociety alleges that porn is healthy (bullshit, the desensitization and other problems it causes are far, far from healthy) and lies to us, saying that it's about \"expression\" and \"freedom.\" I am reminded of a story where a Buddhist man entered a monastery for 30 days and couldn't speak one word, had no sexual activity, ate and drank just enough to survive, was forced to endure harsh temperature/climate conditions and didn't sleep on a bed. When he returned, his good friend couldn't believe he would voluntarily submit to something like that and asked him why he would give up all of his freedoms. The Buddhist man smiled and said, \"Give up my freedoms? My friend, it was only when I was in the monastery there that I was truly free. I was free from desire. Free from the prison of seeking food or sex or all pleasures. Free from needing to speak, free from needing the temperature to be set at a perfect level. You see, it was only in abandoning all of my desires and the things which controlled me that truly permitted me to be free. Liberation is freedom from attachment. I am more free when I give up these things because I am not a slave to them.\"\n\nThank you so much for sharing your story, and for encouraging all of us. We are not perfect, but we strive every day to be. I don't know if I will ever fully overcome this addiction and be done with it forever, but I know that I can make it today and your post helped immensely.

It's scary and fascinating that sexual arousal can be piggy-backed on violence and desire for power.  It can basically be co-opted by other drives and lead us down a very bad path, or, alternatively, it can be closely tied to deep feelings of love and connection.

You needed money they needed a fix. You provided them with their fix and got paid in return.

After all who wouldn't want to be admired and adored, right. [Of course I was wrong].This was much before I watched porn, and I have seen a therapist for this and realized that I can't really change this.\n\nOf course, no woman wants this, to be put on a pedestal and worshipped. It would always kill any attraction I could think of developing. I thought I was the better person for just wanting an emotional connection with a women, where everyone just wanted to  use them for sex.\n\nWhen I watched porn for the first time, it literally broke my heart to see girls treated this way.

Life becomes unmanageable because the disease of addictions runs my life regardless of what I am addicted to.  My ability to form relationships hinges on being spiritually grounded.  When I drink or take a drug (recovering alcoholic/addict), fap, or partake in any other compulsive act in an unhealthy way I lose all ability to live a manageable life.  That \"perfect buzz\" or \"perfect fantasy\" can never fill the hole in my heart and spirit that I crave and long for.  It does not mean you can't be a functioning addict, but the addiction will most likely hold back the potential to be happy, joyous, and free.", "id": "d7gcgav"}, {"comment": "Nope.

The most important tip is BE GOOD IN BED...watch tutorials, porn, practice with the town slut..

My mother found out my dad had a couple affairs 7+ years ago, as well as hiding his phone from her ever since he got one. Porn and his masked sexual feelings have done nothing but make him look like a coward to my mother and her family as well as to his two older children, both older than 18. My brother in 5th grade still has no idea about why they split up, but I'm sure he'll find out when he's old enough. Don't put yourself through this pain and guilt. It hurts others tremendously like OP mentioned. What I want to point out through his mistake, is that he slowly justified his actions. His response to all of this was that he was bored. He spent so much time away from us on business trips when I was younger, It makes me sick to think he's introduced myself to one of the woman he slept with. Now at the moment, he's trying to gain more custody ground with my younger brother by trying to make my mom look worse any way he can. It breaks my heart how much a person can try to hide just to feel justified in his own family's eyes. I know for a fact porn was a problem in his family. His dad (my grandfather) had a porn stash. Porn makes us selfish, it made me look at life much differently than I did last year. I want to thank everyone in this subreddit for their support.

Everyone. We all put on masks of what we want to be, and try to make sure the mask becomes our next self. Some masks crack, exposing the void behind them. Some people succeed, but you will never see under the hood the price and the scars that was paid for to achieve that. That price is always paid in shards of one's own soul, for this is how it works.\n\nI'm a 28 year old virgin myself that spent the last 13 or 14 years fapping, delusional about the porn into thinking it was normal, thinking that I will stop whenever I will finally decent relationship. The moment never came, up until the moment porn would no longer fill in that void with porn. I never drank alcohol or smoked weed, thought I was damn healthy... So it took that long for me to get the truth... I ended up in my personal hell of severe anxiety, depression, added with the professional overburn. I've been fighting these with no medication for about 2 years (go and tell you have all of these - and your career is done). I was keeping effort to play my role of the cool social tech guy up until I could go no further. It was too much pain behind that smile. \n\nAs you've ripped away porn from your life, so did I. Cold turkey, hardmode, after 13+ years. I'm still kicking for already 300+ days. And for one moment in my life I could face that very Void, burning inside. I didn't rush to replace porn with something else for a while, just stared into that abyss and I learned one thing: Everyone has that Void inside. And everyone is addicted to something. Something that could fill it. Be it dancing, traveling, gambling or even books. Everyone compulsively tries to fill in the void. Take one of their favorite toys from them and they will suffer.\n\nYes, you're paying the price now, just like I am. But remember one thing: You got some of your soul back, endured the loss of something that your brain treasured most. Don't waste it. You got those shiny pieces back in your wallet, feeling that you can buy the whole world with them. But what will you buy? Choose wisely, plan ahead and remember, that just like you have got those shards back by ditching porn from your life you can get at least some of them back by ditching something else. Porn is no different. And don't be afraid to see that burning void again, after you recycle another minor addiction. Be it coffee or that dancing you've been too hooked into.\n\nAny change is painful. Any change requires sacrifice. Any change requires you to take a journey through that Void. But the true challenge is not doing it once, like we've (hopefully) done with porn. The challenge is in doing it repeatedly, each time the world requires you to change. Remember that lesson well and you'll be grateful for all those years you've wasted, for they've given you an ultimate chance to learn to bear that void inside you, and through this knowledge you get the power that other people never had a chance to harness.\n\nKeep going, keep fighting. For the fight is really only over when we're dead and buried. \n\n"], [10, "Thank you. I am that 17 year you were right now.

I don't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of but that is changing every day that I live my life fully engaged and facing my problems.  I'm in a 12-step program and several times a week I meet a person who is 50 who wishes he got sober at 40.  I meet a guy 60 who wishes he could start at 50.  An 75 year old woman who wants to go back to 60.  I just met and had a conversation with a 94 year old who friggin' has children that are 70.  She tells me I'm just a baby and have no idea what life has in store.  \n\nIt's good so many of you people in your 20's are taking life seriously, and life should be taken seriously, but shit, don't get caught in regret and thinking your life is *over.*  I like to flip it and tell you guys, *I would fucking give anything to go back to my twenties knowing what I know now.* But, you know what?  ***That will never fucking happen*** and it's a waste of my mental energy to think about it. Guilt, shame, and regret are shit unless they motivate you and you move on ***fast.***   Spend too much time on regret and wallowing in the past, and that can develop into a wicked cycle where you punish or sabotage yourself.  Or perhaps the guilt and shame will cause psychological complexes that keep you from progressing, effectively keeping you stuck. This can become a negative feedback loop.\n\nGet busy livin'!    Don't waste your life but have fun and fuck off *once in a while.* Taking life *too* seriously is just as bad as not taking it seriously enough.

Do not rule out therapy, medication, *anything.* NEVER GIVE UP.  It took me until 40 to begin treatment for PTSD and ADD.  I do medication, therapy, group therapy, 12-step meetings, and attend regular meditation groups in addition to solo practice.  Yoga, the gym, eating right, avoiding toxic people and situations.

Seriously. I missed out on a lot of fun/experience just because I mistakenly didn't believe in myself. I went through ALL of college without getting laid. Not even a kiss. I'm not even a bad looking guy.\n\nThis is more toward folks reading this and not necessarily the OP. Even if you're older than me and still haven't gotten laid, there's always hope. You don't even have to tell girls you're a virgin. It matters a lot less than you think it does. Girls will assume you're not, anyway, so there's no reason to tell them. If you are a virgin, I'd honestly recommend just trying to get laid for your first few times rather than getting a gf. Dating sites are an easy way to break in.\n\nBiggest lifestyle change you can make is dropping the weed to maybe a once a week sort of thing and hit the gym, hard, and get some gains, and never missing a day. Having a manly looking body will get you laid more than anything else will, as sad as that is, especially if you're already somewhat attractive. Yes, confidence is important and key, but honestly I would say having a nice body beats that because you'll gain confidence as a result of making progress.\n\nHell, if I had taken this mentality at 24 rather than 27, I can't imagine where I'd be now.

Comparing yourself with others will only end in misery and pain. Everyone's path is different. Learn to honor yours. Besides, if you continue to lead a 'Slight Edge' life for the next 20-25 years, you will have accomplished much more than a lot many people who have ever lived.\n\n3. You think you aren't progressing, but the very fact that you are aware of the need to improve, is progress. Not everyone is capable of such introspection. \n\n4. 24 isn't late. Neither is 30, or 40. Or even 50. Or 60. You truly find NoFap only when you need it. Only when your life gets so bad that you are forced to make a change. Accept that it came to you at 22 or 23. Some people get it at 18. Some won't till they're 40-45. So just be thankful that you got that wake up call and chose not to ignore it. \n\nYou're a healthy young guy (without any disabilities) in a first world country.

We are conditioned to want and even feel entitled to the hottest bitches because we can see many hot ass women on porn nowadays at the click of a button. Get out of that mindset and your view on women and the world will expand accordingly.\n\nWoman are more than makeup and symmetrical facial proportions and fat in the right places. Woman are living, breathing human beings who want intimacy just as much as you.

We all put on masks of what we want to be, and try to make sure the mask becomes our next self. Some masks crack, exposing the void behind them. Some people succeed, but you will never see under the hood the price and the scars that was paid for to achieve that. That price is always paid in shards of one's own soul, for this is how it works.\n\nI'm a 28 year old virgin myself that spent the last 13 or 14 years fapping, delusional about the porn into thinking it was normal, thinking that I will stop whenever I will finally decent relationship. The moment never came, up until the moment porn would no longer fill in that void with porn. I never drank alcohol or smoked weed, thought I was damn healthy... So it took that long for me to get the truth... I ended up in my personal hell of severe anxiety, depression, added with the professional overburn. I've been fighting these with no medication for about 2 years (go and tell you have all of these - and your career is done). I was keeping effort to play my role of the cool social tech guy up until I could go no further. It was too much pain behind that smile. \n\nAs you've ripped away porn from your life, so did I. Cold turkey, hardmode, after 13+ years. I'm still kicking for already 300+ days. And for one moment in my life I could face that very Void, burning inside. I didn't rush to replace porn with something else for a while, just stared into that abyss and I learned one thing: Everyone has that Void inside. And everyone is addicted to something. Something that could fill it. Be it dancing, traveling, gambling or even books. Everyone compulsively tries to fill in the void. Take one of their favorite toys from them and they will suffer.\n\nYes, you're paying the price now, just like I am. But remember one thing: You got some of your soul back, endured the loss of something that your brain treasured most. Don't waste it. You got those shiny pieces back in your wallet, feeling that you can buy the whole world with them. But what will you buy? Choose wisely, plan ahead and remember, that just like you have got those shards back by ditching porn from your life you can get at least some of them back by ditching something else. Porn is no different. And don't be afraid to see that burning void again, after you recycle another minor addiction. Be it coffee or that dancing you've been too hooked into.\n\nAny change is painful. Any change requires sacrifice. Any change requires you to take a journey through that Void. But the true challenge is not doing it once, like we've (hopefully) done with porn. The challenge is in doing it repeatedly, each time the world requires you to change. Remember that lesson well and you'll be grateful for all those years you've wasted, for they've given you an ultimate chance to learn to bear that void inside you, and through this knowledge you get the power that other people never had a chance to harness.\n\nKeep going, keep fighting.

Go on www.muscleforlife.com and read some of the articles. [Get the book.](http://www.amazon.com/Bigger-Leaner-Stronger-Bodybuilding-Weightlifting-ebook/dp/B006XF5BTG) Lean muscle will increase your testosterone, which adds to your energy and assertiveness. It's a feedback loop and an upward cycle. The rich definitely get richer.\n\nStart eating healthy if you don't already. Lots of greens. Juice them if you can. It tastes nasty at first - but it will get better with time. Eat calorically dense food. I'm talking lean chicken breast, broccoli, mixed veggies, etc. You can eat healthy at a cheap cost, don't think you can't. Skip the sugars. Skip the junk food. Minimize your grains. You're not eating only for your physical health - but for your mental health as well. Read [Brain Maker](http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Maker-Power-Microbes-Protect/dp/0316380105) to see how food affects your brain.

I wasted a lot of money and a lot of time smoking weed. \n\nYou can never replace time. You can replace money. If you can, always choose time over money. Speaking of money, start saving 10% of anything you earn. You will thank yourself later. \n\nDon't fall into petty bullshit. Always think long term. \n\nDrop anyone who is lame, negative, or petty like a hot coal. I don't care if they're the President. You shouldn't have any space for that in your life. No drama. No negativity. Surround yourself with like minded individuals who want to conquer.\n\nGet up EARLY on weekends and get shit done. Don't sleep in until 3pm. That's fucking lame. Get up early and learn how to do a new skill, like start a business.

Most of what you'll read in class will be bullshit. Read Self-Development books. Read Biographies. Read good Fiction. Read business books. Some of my favorites are Think and Grow Rich, 48 Laws of Power, Teddy Roosevelt's biography, and the 10X Rule. \n\nThrow yourself into as many social activities as possible. I cannot emphasize this enough. You will be around tons of different people and you won't get locked into one worldview. You'll also increase your social skills.\n\nGet as much experience with women as possible. I don't necessarily mean sexual, but if it progresses that way - fine. Have as many girl friends as possible. Not only will you be around feminine energy, but you have a higher chance of meeting other girls who you connect with on a deeper level as well. \n\nContinue with NoFap. 99% of the men (if they can be called that) do not do this.

Overall, I feel more in tune and in touch with myself. My strength now comes from within, rather than a sense of void or lack that constantly needs to be fed. behind my anxiety, there is a subtle but definite confidence that's just there. Grounded. \n\nI feel more alive and in the present moment. I still have anxiety and haven't really left or rather expanded my comfort zone yet. You could say I'm taking baby steps. The three things I know I need to rid myself of are: PMO - Weed - and Video Games. \n\nVideo games has  probably been my first addiction that started at very young age. It's also the one I feel most attached to and it's going to be the hardest of the three to remove from my life. But I know that leaving it and the other two behind will open up doors. \n\nA lot of people say you need to distract yourself with this or that. But I think you must create space in your life in order for new things to flourish.\n\nI want to get out more and meet women and talk to women and get more comfortable doing that. I want to meet a woman and fall in love and be happy. It's something that I want and I know it won't happen over night. Hell, I need to get out more in general. \n\nI have a heart full of hope and head filled with doubt. I'm going off on a tangent here so I'll cut it short and at least answer your questions. Nofap is real. It will give you strength. It is a foundation to build a meaningful life upon. \n\nMy counter should read 17. I've been doing nofap for about a solid 8 months. The longest I've gone was 43 days. I'm going for the big 90. Not because I think I'll be cured of all ailments by then but it's a goal to strive for. A milestone. an achievement. Like a child learning to use the potty and not shit himself, I'm an adult learning to not jizz myself. \n\nBy resisting this strong temptation to fap we are all collectively harnessing a very powerful energy within ourselves. Sexual energy. The most powerful energy in the world. Great wars have been fought to gain the love and trust of a woman. Sex is most widely used in advertising because it is the most effective. It's no surprise that porn is one of the biggest industries. \n\nYes, I mean compensating by living life through your pain, through fear, anger... It's all the same. We came into this world kicking and screaming. Life is chaotic enough as it is. We don't need to add to it. \n\nBottom line, Love yourself (even your darker side), love your neighbors, love your enemies. Love this great blue ball we inhabit called earth. We're all in this together. \n\nPeace and Love.

Even now, I can look back at my life age 17-25 and cringe and at how I saw the world and how porn made me very complacent/a pussy, how much I avoided confrontation and never took a risk with girls for fear of rejection, even when the girl was obviously interested. Seriously. I missed out on a lot of fun/experience just because I mistakenly didn't believe in myself. I went through ALL of college without getting laid. Not even a kiss. I'm not even a bad looking guy.\n\nThis is more toward folks reading this and not necessarily the OP. Even if you're older than me and still haven't gotten laid, there's always hope. You don't even have to tell girls you're a virgin. It matters a lot less than you think it does. Girls will assume you're not, anyway, so there's no reason to tell them. If you are a virgin, I'd honestly recommend just trying to get laid for your first few times rather than getting a gf. Dating sites are an easy way to break in.\n\nBiggest lifestyle change you can make is dropping the weed to maybe a once a week sort of thing and hit the gym, hard, and get some gains, and never missing a day. Having a manly looking body will get you laid more than anything else will, as sad as that is, especially if you're already somewhat attractive. Yes, confidence is important and key, but honestly I would say having a nice body beats that because you'll gain confidence as a result of making progress.\n\nHell, if I had taken this mentality at 24 rather than 27, I can't imagine where I'd be now.

Comparing yourself with others will only end in misery and pain. Everyone's path is different. Learn to honor yours. Besides, if you continue to lead a 'Slight Edge' life for the next 20-25 years, you will have accomplished much more than a lot many people who have ever lived.\n\n3. You think you aren't progressing, but the very fact that you are aware of the need to improve, is progress. Not everyone is capable of such introspection. \n\n4. 24 isn't late. Neither is 30, or 40. Or even 50. Or 60. You truly find NoFap only when you need it. Only when your life gets so bad that you are forced to make a change. Accept that it came to you at 22 or 23. Some people get it at 18. Some won't till they're 40-45. So just be thankful that you got that wake up call and chose not to ignore it. \n\nYou're a healthy young guy (without any disabilities) in a first world country.

You aren't \"out there\" if that makes sense. You can't just stay the best years of your life living at home. You don't grow that way.\n\nI could go deeper but I'll stop because its already been emphasized in this thread that looking at the past is just pissing in the wind, so I'll let it go.

Comparing yourself to others is an ego-centric game you can never win.  \n\nBesides, your friends moving to other cities and getting engaged, then probably having kids, ask yourself do they really have the 'good life'?  Your normie friends are in a cage too, it's just a nicer cage than the one you've been in.  They're in the society trap.  They're no more free or better off than you, they have jobs and mortgages and don't have the freedom to do whatever the fuck they want to do whenever they want to do it.  And they come out of their cage too, difference is it's in what's called a 'mid life crisis'.  You're getting this shit done in your 20's.  Now who do you think is 'ahead' and 'behind'?  You're getting the hard shit done early, you won't settle for a life that's 'comfortable'.  \n\nWhen shit gets hard you've already developed the strength to just push through, where normal people crack and retreat to their comfort zone you've built a life where the only way you feel comfortable is when you're pushing beyond the edge of yours.  Who the fuck is ahead and behind now?  \n\nYou should also forgive yourself dude.  You weren't stupid, you weren't coping, you hid in porn and drugs because you couldn't let the real you out.  If you can't learn to forgive yourself, then when your motivation will runs out, you'll beat yourself up, you'll fall into a spiral, you'll crack and binge and stop making progress.  \n\nAlso ironically, when you do 'make it', when you massively improve yourself, when you have all the shit you want, when you're free in every way including financially, what you will have done is proven to your 17 year old self is that yes, everything will be fine.  It's almost like your 17 year old self was really looking out for you by smoking all that weed and watching all that porn, otherwise you probably wouldn't have had the leverage that you have now, to take massive action and get your shit together.

It is part of the primal push-pull mechanism of attraction. Start by admiring and validating women you might think are ugly because there's a good chance they will help you grow as a fucking man.
