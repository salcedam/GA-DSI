It takes us time, but we're a big nation and we don't let the majority become a tyranny - which was part of Jefferson's design when he bolted all this together.

Our rights and freedoms are constantly retuned, and usually enlarged, as modern life makes a need more apparent. \n\nAnd this system, this body of laws, continues to work well, even when knuckleheads gain positions of power. Civil war reconstruction, a time when what's likely the worst president in American history headed the executive, and we survived it. Nixon placing himself above the law, and we survived it.

Here in FL if you get a ticket you can take it to a tucket lawyer and pay them say 69$ and they will go to court for you and try and have it dismissed or try and bargain it down to no points ans no driving school and usually you have to pay a small fee and it's as if your ticket disappears. About 6-7 years ago they mandated a minimum court cost if you do a ticket clinic and are found guilty, its a minimum of 100$ court costs now but if it gets yhrown out you pay zero. So in many cases they get you no points, no fees and no driving school. Also from my understanding you can't really do this in many other states. So for this reason my friend can still drive with 75+ tickets. Every now and then he will get slapped with a big court fee but also very often he gets off with absolutely no fee or points. Also, insurance never is notified unless you received points so they aren't too clued into what type of driver you are. So when you get a ticket usually after 2 weeks you start getting advertisement junk mail about ticket clinics that want your business. So there is no hiding from your parents that you got a ticket. So if you're a teenager its nearly impossible to try and hide from your parents because of all the ads that start coming in thr mail. Its total shit, you cannot stop the inevitable. So as a teenager its best to fess up if you get a ticket because unless you grab the mail every day your parents are going to receive a good 6-10 ads for ticket lawyers after you get a ticket.

Had he not had that policy I could have seen him going to jail for that, I mean at 4am he drove into someone's house!!! It wasn't as bad as it sounds but he did smash into a car out front of someone's house and then ricoched into their house causing some damage. All as a result from following someone that was going like 50 MPH in their neighborhood and they were drunk so they flew past their house so they slammed the breaks and rather than hit that person at 50 he swerved and hit a car parked on the side of the road totaling it and then continued into that persons house. Then he said after the person who slammed their breaks was pike WTF man... meanwhile my friend said there was about 25 feet of burned rubber from them slamming the breaks... all of this took place at 4 am.... home owner wakes up and just stands at his door until the cops showed up.

They were more about social welfare within the black community + other disavantaged groups more than anything else (For example; the current system of free school lunch is originated from this movement). The current stigma against  and misinformation about the black panthers is also largely because goverment smear campaigns conducted throughout the 60's (Look up COINTELPRO if you are curious).\n\nAlso, you can call me SJW trash, down vote me or whatever, and I already know im going to get a ton of hate for this because reddit is a massive hivemind that likes to delude itself into thinking that it isnt, But if Black people merely /saying/ that there lives are valid and important; that we derserve to not be carelessly killed and gunned down by police officers while literal white mass shooters can be taken into custody without even sratch on them, and that we should get the same exact rights and treatment that you have always had for centuries; some how threatens you, or makes you believe that you are now being \"reverse repressed\", you should look deep within yourself and figure out why you are really upset by BLM. Someone gaining the right you have always had isnt \"reverse discrimination\". You say that you understand that racism is pervasive in america but yet when black people actually voice thier complaints about said racism you turn around and say they are just whining and complaining and are just trying to recieve \"special treatment\", so what is it that you really believe? No one is asking you to be guilty, No one is saying that this is your fault. All we ask of you is to simply recognize that you, whether you like it or not, whether you were complicit in it or not, do benefit from the systematic opression of black people in the past and to the very lesser extent in the present; and move forward /with/ us to rectify the issues of the past. It isnt even a issue about race, Its simple economics and cold hard fact. Your white guilt does nothing for us, and contrary to popular belief, that is not what we are asking for. White guilt doesnt initiate prision reform. White guilt doesnt decrease high unemployment rates within the black community. White guilt doesnt stop housing inquality. White guilt doesnt help the crumbling education system in inner cities. We know this. YOU know this. Wether or not you choose to feel guilty about systematic opression is totally your prerogative, no one is forcing you to feel guilty. Making it seem like comprehensive reform + BLM is some evil movement trying to paint all white people as \"evil bigoted conservative nutjobs\" is totally ridiculous. I mean just think about it, How can anyone possibly get \"Black people are superior to white people, we are untouchable, bow before your new god kings,ect.\" out of \"Black Lives matter, please stop treating our lives like they are not important as yours. Please stop killing our kids.\" unless on some very deep  subconcious level you do not want the systems of power that keep black people and other people of color opressed to be challegned,threatened, reformed, or even simply /questioned/.\n\nAs it comes to Beyonce, different strokes for different folks, But she is a wildly talented singer.

Putting your comments out here, for me, is like creating a super fragile 'naked' horcrux that anyone can demolish with no consequence to themselves - and maybe I need thicker skin.  The reddit hivemind is perhaps a textbook example of what a 'world without consequence' would look like.  We shouldn't need consequences to be better people - but, we so condition ourselves and our children to behave based on consequences.  Our religions, our educational systems, so much of our behavior development mechanisms depend upon there being consequences to our actions.  But, on reddit/internet, there is so little consequence for anyone who can say the most mean, ignorant, and just plain hateful things.  And, then there are the internet stalkers.  And, then I think about whether I'm going to really accomplish anything by saying all of this versus all of that potential trouble.  Sure, I could say something profound and it might change a person's life for the better - but I already do that in other ways in other settings, without risking having to deal with all of the internet's potential baggage.  In addition, we don't do a very good job of encouraging polite, professional discourse.  Teaching people that it is okay to disagree and how to do it - valuing differing opinions because they can probably teach us something new.  Oh, and let's not forget the grammar folks.  Plus, it is very hard to convey tone in writing.  Absent vocals, body language, eye contact, etc. so much of a conversation is missed.  And, then heaven forbid that you make a mistake, honest and unintentional - here it is forever saved.  Here it is for the unforgiving masses, the narrow minded dolts who can't change themselves or their way of thinking (or who want to use that as their excuse for just continuing to be the way they are and to not put forth the effort to change) and who won't believe or consider that perhaps you've changed your mind or that you're not an idiot, etc. So, yeah, and I've already spent too much time on this, I've got other things I should be doing, and the time I would then also take scrutinizing all that I've written to try and make it 'smarter', 'nicer', more politically correct...

Especially on the toxic place that is the internet, where there's tons of people who refuse to have an open mind, act condescending, and just want to feel like they're right and someone else is wrong.\n\nHowever, depending on the person and your approach you might just be able to change their mind. Keep in mind though that it's not about changing people's viewpoints. It's about understanding eachother's viewpoints, and change can be a result of that. When you come in contact with other viewpoints, you often improve on your own, because you can see another perspective and have to try to better your arguments. In this case, It's not a waste of time. Ofcourse, if someone's ignorant on a subject, that's when it's more about educating the other person. Even if they're not going to change their mind, I sometimes like to comment just so I'm sure there's a counter comment to the misinformation, but I'd like not to be too much of a dick about it.\n\nThe thing I've noticed is that the tone greatly effects wether people are willing to listen. After all, people are very much used to dealing with very condescending people on the internet, and can have bad days. Try to be as fair/reasonable to the other person's viewpoint as you can and be open to the idea, try to not be unintentionally condescending/hostile (Even if the other side is not adhering to this), clearly mention when you assume anything, act polite when pointing out mistakes, not use too many logical fallacies, etc.  But most importantly: Genuinely listen to them, and respond accordingly! I tend to only truly do these things when I put in a conscious effort.\n\nThese kind of things lead into pretty civil discussions. I've noticed this tends to end in ''Ah, I see where you're coming from'' type of discussions, where both learn a bit from eachother. Sometimes people seem to be willing to listen, is all that I'm trying to say :3.

I try not to think to highly of my own opinions and there are too many trolls who respond in ways that they wouldn't, if they were speaking to you face to face.  Putting your comments out here, for me, is like creating a super fragile 'naked' horcrux that anyone can demolish with no consequence to themselves - and maybe I need thicker skin.  The reddit hivemind is perhaps a textbook example of what a 'world without consequence' would look like.  We shouldn't need consequences to be better people - but, we so condition ourselves and our children to behave based on consequences.  Our religions, our educational systems, so much of our behavior development mechanisms depend upon there being consequences to our actions.  But, on reddit/internet, there is so little consequence for anyone who can say the most mean, ignorant, and just plain hateful things.  And, then there are the internet stalkers.  And, then I think about whether I'm going to really accomplish anything by saying all of this versus all of that potential trouble.  Sure, I could say something profound and it might change a person's life for the better - but I already do that in other ways in other settings, without risking having to deal with all of the internet's potential baggage.  In addition, we don't do a very good job of encouraging polite, professional discourse.  Teaching people that it is okay to disagree and how to do it - valuing differing opinions because they can probably teach us something new.  Oh, and let's not forget the grammar folks.  Plus, it is very hard to convey tone in writing.  Absent vocals, body language, eye contact, etc. so much of a conversation is missed.  And, then heaven forbid that you make a mistake, honest and unintentional - here it is forever saved.  Here it is for the unforgiving masses, the narrow minded dolts who can't change themselves or their way of thinking (or who want to use that as their excuse for just continuing to be the way they are and to not put forth the effort to change) and who won't believe or consider that perhaps you've changed your mind or that you're not an idiot, etc. So, yeah, and I've already spent too much time on this, I've got other things I should be doing, and the time I would then also take scrutinizing all that I've written to try and make it 'smarter', 'nicer', more politically correct...

It's lessened for most media (radio, broadcast TV), though, not completely eliminated, due to the quality of the source.  Generally, radio and TV, and even to some extent CDs don't have the dynamic range to really have a lot of different volumes. Specifically, with CDs they're mastered to have a common comfortable listening volume, so you set it once and forget it.  The artist did the work for you.\n\nSo why not do that with Movies?  because explosions are loud, and they want them to BE loud for realism, specifically in theaters.  Theater sound systems can really pump out the high volume sounds at crystal clear fidelity.  And let's be honest, if you were ACTUALLY watching that explosion, it would be even louder than it is in the movie.\n\nI find, that personally, part of the issue is that I hit a plateau, where if the fidelity is high (very clear sound), after a certain point, loudness ceases to be perceptible.  Only in cases where you lose fidelity the louder the volume, do I realize the volume is still going up.  I mean, once it's \"loud\" that's it.  at least until it starts getting into concert volumes.  I find that contributes to the problem, however, I also find that on MOST of the systems I've heard, fidelity is lost as you get louder.  VERY FEW sound systems I've heard turned wayyyy up, have very high fidelity at very high volume; for those that do, however, I tend to hear more of the audio than I normally would.

The problem lies in the dynamics allowed by today's digital technology and the translation of material mixed for a multi channel theater format (which is highly standardized, but still has variables) to a format that works on your TV. Typically after a film has been mixed for release in theaters a \"near field\" version is created with the goal of reducing the dynamic range of the material for better playback on smaller speakers and with the conversion of surround to stereo in mind. That being said, the intentions of the film makers in regards to the sound mix are kept intact. The film makers utilize the wide dynamic range of today's digital formats to their full effect. If you reverse mixed a movie like Mad Max, Bourne or The Revenant to play perfectly on your stereo television and then played that mix in the theater you'd be very disappointed with the sound. So, it's a big compromise with lots of variables.

It's lessened for most media (radio, broadcast TV), though, not completely eliminated, due to the quality of the source.  Generally, radio and TV, and even to some extent CDs don't have the dynamic range to really have a lot of different volumes. Specifically, with CDs they're mastered to have a common comfortable listening volume, so you set it once and forget it.  The artist did the work for you.\n\nSo why not do that with Movies?  because explosions are loud, and they want them to BE loud for realism, specifically in theaters.  Theater sound systems can really pump out the high volume sounds at crystal clear fidelity.  And let's be honest, if you were ACTUALLY watching that explosion, it would be even louder than it is in the movie.\n\nI find, that personally, part of the issue is that I hit a plateau, where if the fidelity is high (very clear sound), after a certain point, loudness ceases to be perceptible.  Only in cases where you lose fidelity the louder the volume, do I realize the volume is still going up.  I mean, once it's \"loud\" that's it.  at least until it starts getting into concert volumes.  I find that contributes to the problem, however, I also find that on MOST of the systems I've heard, fidelity is lost as you get louder.  VERY FEW sound systems I've heard turned wayyyy up, have very high fidelity at very high volume; for those that do, however, I tend to hear more of the audio than I normally would.

Instead of waking you up with a noise, it wakes you up with a light that gradually turns on over 20-30 minutes to simulate dawn. It is a much nicer way to wake than a horrible screeching noise. \n\nI'm not sure about the scientific proof for this, but meditation for a little bit during the day helped for me. The Buddify app is nice and convenient. I'm told short naps can serve the same purpose. \n\nIf you are coming out of a particularly stressful period, take it easy for a few months. 8 hours of sleep, eat regular meals with a little protein every 4 or so hours, take plenty of exercise but avoid super high intensity HIT sort of things or working yourself to real exhaustion.

Every. Single. Day. I had a lot of people tell me this and I brushed it off until I got a puppy who would wake me up every morning to go out. It truly does set your sleep rhythms, and even when I get to bed waaaay too late, I *still* wake up 15-20 mins before my alarm. Plus, not waking up to an alarm makes mornings approximately 5000x better. If you fail to get the sleep you need at night you can make up the difference with naps/meditation.\n\n2) **Get natural light.** Whenever I move I pay special attention to the direction of the bedroom windows. If it doesn't have an east-facing window, it won't do. Waking up with the sun enforces point number 1, as its a *much* more pleasant experience than waking up to a blaring alarm. If you don't have the luxury of the sun, you can get one of those lightbox things. I have a friend who swears by one.\n\nBottom line: stop being like teenage me and pretending your body wasn't built to wake up every day with the sun.

Every. Single. Day. I had a lot of people tell me this and I brushed it off until I got a puppy who would wake me up every morning to go out. It truly does set your sleep rhythms, and even when I get to bed waaaay too late, I *still* wake up 15-20 mins before my alarm. Plus, not waking up to an alarm makes mornings approximately 5000x better. If you fail to get the sleep you need at night you can make up the difference with naps/meditation.\n\n2) **Get natural light.** Whenever I move I pay special attention to the direction of the bedroom windows. If it doesn't have an east-facing window, it won't do. Waking up with the sun enforces point number 1, as its a *much* more pleasant experience than waking up to a blaring alarm. If you don't have the luxury of the sun, you can get one of those lightbox things. I have a friend who swears by one.\n\nBottom line: stop being like teenage me and pretending your body wasn't built to wake up every day with the sun.

I fell so hard for her, and yesterday i had a small dream about her, where we were reaching for each other's hands, but just before we touched, she turned invisible, and i woke up with my hand up high as it fell down.\n\nThings aren't going great with me now"], [1, "Every time my dad shows up in a dream.  I always ask him \"Dad, where have you been?\" He never answers, just keeps on pretending like he never left.  A few weeks ago I had a dream where I was at the stove in our kitchen and he was sitting on the kitchen floor, holding my youngest daughter.  He passed a few months after my eldest daughter was born, he never got to meet my girls.  I ask him again \"Dad, where have you been?\" but again, he doesn't answer.  I just felt so happy that he got to meet one of them, finally.  And then something happens, like my brain is telling me that what's happening right now is not possible and I slowly realize it's a dream and I just start bawling in his arms and wake up.  "], [1, "One time my wife came up to me and told me she was pregnant and i was so happy I was actually crying I told her I have never been so happy in my life but she pushes me out of the hug and tells me the baby is not mine.  \n\nWhen I woke up I realized it was a dream and my wife was sleeping beside me and I wanted to wake her up and start screaming at her.  Obviously logic was telling me that would be stupid but I was still seeing red my teeth were clenched and my hands were balled into fists.  I practically ran out of the room.  Even though I knew it wasnt real I never went from being so happy to so sad/mad/betrayed so quickly.\n\nWhen my wife finally woke up she came to hug me and I still hesitated a bit so she asked what was wrong and than I laughed realizing how silly it was and told her.  I felt fine after that and never had a dream or even a real life experience like that where I was close to feeling that kind of emotion"], [1, "Funny you mention this now. Literally had a dream early this morning after falling back asleep (got woken up by chickens in the backyard at my new place). I had my elbows in the lap of my girlfriend as I drifted at the edge of some pool when she revealed a small gun under her towel. I admired it's sleek, small design with wooden  streaks and fired a test shot into the air. The bullets shot through the high archinggreenhouse-esque roof above the large pool to no calamity from the crowd. Intrigued, I aimed at a guy wade-running at the other end of the pool like he was a thrown clay target. I pulled the trigger and my shot was true. The guy collapsed in the water and was no more. Everybody in the pool became absolutely silent and still. I looked at the gun and I ran away. As I woke up in my new home irl, I was convinced of my terrible crime and couldn't shake the guilt or fear of being caught. I was woken up early by the chickens and tried to go back asleep, but the feeling lingered for several hours, even after I woke and rationalized the impossibility of the event, I didn't have complete closure until I called my girlfriend and told her about the strange dream and confir med that she didn't kill anyone.

And then sleeping together in our bed during said party and me walking in on them not even trying to hide it. That one took about a week for me to stop crying over randomly.

I should be up there finishing it. What's going to happen to the audience if they don't get a show? Will they be okay? I should be up there!\n\nMy friend led me away. We left the stage and the second we were gone I felt a huge sense of relief. Something told me it was okay to leave a little early, and that the show could in fact continue without me. The audience would be okay. My friends would be okay.\n\nI had left that school months before I had that dream. It was a terrible school and most of my friends had no way out.

If you have a job that you don't need to do that also can be highly motivating. That's why a lot of richer people, with enough money for generations keep on working.\n\nOf course purpose there is another thing, but again.

What I'm doing differently this time is I decided to start taking cold showers, as some guy in one of the /r/getdisciplined  posts suggested. Cold showers are great as they put you in an uncomfortable situation which I have a habit of running away from (like for example studying). Of course knowing me I would have just quit after a say or two so I decided to go slow and started out with 5 seconds of cold water at the very end of daily showering and slowly increased it from there. Now I'm at a point where my showers are 50% hot and 50% cold which for me is huge success.

I think it has something to do with boredom. When people are bored they usually want to do stuff. When you go to bed, you don't have anything to do, so your mind is free and you are bored. Especially when you are not overly tired that makes you want to do something.\n\nI think it's also why video games work so well: You feel like doing something.\n\nThe difference between work for money and work in video games (depending on what you do for a living of course) often is just that you don't feel forced. If you have a job that you don't need to do that also can be highly motivating. That's why a lot of richer people, with enough money for generations keep on working.\n\nOf course purpose there is another thing, but again. You usually don't feel motivated to do something without a purpose. That's kind of the opposite of motivation.\n\ntldr: People love to feel productive and are motivated when they are not directly forced to do stuff. They dislike boredom and someone forcing them to do stuff.", "id": "dalw50n"}]]], "4cm40p": ["DAE always see R. L.

It feels like listening to a song where one of the guitars isn't plugged in to the amp. It's incredibly distracting.", "id": "d2843my"}, {"comment": "For me, I just don't like the sound when it's in the whole song by itself. It sounds more like a percussive instrument\n\n> break it up with melodic singing bits almost like they're apologizing to the people listening who don't like harsh vocals\n\nNah. To me, it's not about apologizing, but using it as an effect more than the vocals. Now if it's gimmicky, then yeah, I can't listen to it", "id": "d287lif"}, {"comment": "> It sounds more like a percussive instrument\n \nI actually totally agree, and that's something I like about it. Though it's not always used this way, for a lot of bands it has the benefit of letting the guitars carry most of the melodies in the song. With clean singing, the main melodies you're listening to are going to be in the singing, so the guitars mostly just play chords or very simple lines while the singing is going on over it. With harsh vocals the guitars can play mostly riffs and melodies while the vocals add textures and, well, percussion over it. This is also the reason any time you hear a song that was written with harsh vocals covered with clean vocals it sounds horrible.\n \nWe're obviously talking about the same thing, it's just a difference in taste.", "id": "d2884k1"}], [{"comment": "\u00bc \u00bd \u00be ", "id": "d27er4e"}, {"comment": "what the fuck is that username", "id": "d281bw8"}, {"comment": "I made a MD-5 hash out of one of my aliases and cut numbers off from the end until it stopped saying too many characters.", "id": "d2b77kh"}, {"comment": "This is how I usually do it", "id": "d27ijbq"}], [{"comment": "Ayup.

When the trailer for Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace came out, Apple's QuickTime site was THE place to go for trailers. We didn't have YouTube then. And believe it or not, in this generation of Android vs iPhone... hell, back then it was PC vs Mac, even if you had a PC, you had QuickTime and you watched videos on Apple's site. (They even had an adult section, but I didn't find out until later.)\n\nAnyway, the trailer literally broke Apple's site. The demand was so high. People were watching it over and over. You could download the video, but you had to have QuickTime Pro to do it. If you could dig into the page's source and pull the file, of course you could do that, too (I think!), but not everybody knew that. Most didn't, in fact. So while the Phantom Menace trailer didn't break the whole Internet, it broke Apple's service. And that's crazy now because of how big Apple is now. But you have to realize, this was before even the first iPod. Then, Apple was known for the iMac, which had just come out in five colors (later a couple more). And everyone wanted that blue one. (I'd have gone for green, myself.) So it was super hard to find. That was Apple then. And for those watching the movies (2013's Jobs, mostly), this was right after Steve Jobs came back from Apple, so their comeback was just beginning.\n\nNude pictures of Kim Kardashian that don't actually show anything are a long way from breaking the Internet, especially when her nudes that actually do reveal private areas are actually out there (or at least I think they are \u2014 I have no interest in her or her family, so that's just my assumption). Or at least those of far better looking women are. So, I mean, the amount of people who wanted to see that picture \u2014 such a small file, and re-hosted on many different sites \u2014 came nowhere close to breaking any part of the Internet.\n\nIf you want to see the Internet get \"broken\" or anything close to it... I think the 2016 presidential race is one thing that will. All the back and forth about Clinton and Trump. Half-Life 3 being announced might do it. For gamers, at least. But really, no event we can think of would break the Internet. If Trump wins in November, and his party has two out of three branches of the US Government, and then they appoint that ninth judge, they will have complete control, Wall Street and Big Media (RIAA/MPAA etc) will be able to move in and change the Internet. That might be considered breaking it to some. We'll lose a lot of privacy and private companies will gain a ton of oversight into our surfing and downloading habits.

Your overloaded a web server, which was not designed for such capacities.", "id": "d6avx3w"}], [{"comment": "I think it's amusing when it's somewhat relevant. When the trailer for Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace came out, Apple's QuickTime site was THE place to go for trailers. We didn't have YouTube then. And believe it or not, in this generation of Android vs iPhone... hell, back then it was PC vs Mac, even if you had a PC, you had QuickTime and you watched videos on Apple's site. (They even had an adult section, but I didn't find out until later.)\n\nAnyway, the trailer literally broke Apple's site. The demand was so high. People were watching it over and over. You could download the video, but you had to have QuickTime Pro to do it. If you could dig into the page's source and pull the file, of course you could do that, too (I think!), but not everybody knew that. Most didn't, in fact. So while the Phantom Menace trailer didn't break the whole Internet, it broke Apple's service. And that's crazy now because of how big Apple is now. But you have to realize, this was before even the first iPod. Then, Apple was known for the iMac, which had just come out in five colors (later a couple more). And everyone wanted that blue one. (I'd have gone for green, myself.) So it was super hard to find. That was Apple then. And for those watching the movies (2013's Jobs, mostly), this was right after Steve Jobs came back from Apple, so their comeback was just beginning.\n\nNude pictures of Kim Kardashian that don't actually show anything are a long way from breaking the Internet, especially when her nudes that actually do reveal private areas are actually out there (or at least I think they are \u2014 I have no interest in her or her family, so that's just my assumption). Or at least those of far better looking women are. So, I mean, the amount of people who wanted to see that picture \u2014 such a small file, and re-hosted on many different sites \u2014 came nowhere close to breaking any part of the Internet.\n\nIf you want to see the Internet get \"broken\" or anything close to it... I think the 2016 presidential race is one thing that will. All the back and forth about Clinton and Trump. Half-Life 3 being announced might do it. For gamers, at least. But really, no event we can think of would break the Internet. If Trump wins in November, and his party has two out of three branches of the US Government, and then they appoint that ninth judge, they will have complete control, Wall Street and Big Media (RIAA/MPAA etc) will be able to move in and change the Internet. That might be considered breaking it to some. We'll lose a lot of privacy and private companies will gain a ton of oversight into our surfing and downloading habits. But will it be irreparably broken? I don't think so. I think it'll just change. People will move onto something else. Internet will basically be the new Cable TV.

So technically they're right when God shows himself through someone, however as to your point exactly, that someone should also be taking the credit for being the God that did the thing.\n\nAnother line that is similar that is totally misunderstood is the Jesus quote \"I am the way the truth and the life, no one knows the father except through me.\" BUT he wasn't talking about himself being the way, he was talking about the word ME. If you repeated it from your own perspective, \"I don't know god except through ME\" then all of a sudden you realize the power you have over your own friggin life and it is no longer necessary to wait for some 2000yo dead guy to grant you entrance into heaven.

If Jesus wasn't a divine and holy being sent by God to bear our sins through crucifixion, crucifixion loses absolutely all importance (again crucifixion is an essential theme of Christianity). Furthermore, the Jesus/God/goodness is in all of us that you talk about sounds a whole lot like what the Holy Spirit is.

It is where you have a clear vision of goals and things you want to do, but your mental state doesn't change when you reach them. It is an unfulfilled feeling with life in general which can escalate into suicide or self-harm. If you can ask yourself whether you would be happy if things were better off and you could make your dreams come true, or just find dreams that you would want to journey to, then you are just sad and unhappy with your life. I think almost everyone feels this type of depression at some point in their life. If you were given the roads and clear path to success, and you can still say you would be unhappy then I consider you clinically depressed. The one person I know who was loved by so many, and had many successes, and people to care for, though felt deprived of happiness was Robin Williams. He is a shining example of someone who was truly clinically depressed. If you are just in a shitty part of your life and you can't help but feel demoralized from moving forward, then you are depressed based on circumstance. Regardless, my opinions aren't the law, and if you want a professional opinion talk to your doctors to make sure you can handle it and take care of yourself. I would consider myself depressed based upon circumstance, and I wish life would be less cruel. I wouldn't think any less of you if you were depressed, and any other person's suffering is not your obligation to feel happy. You can be glad you aren't suffering as much as them, and I'm sure that they would want you to feel that way too. Though, don't give up on wanting to have a better mental state and do better in life.

And it is not as clearly-defined as \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" \"extreme...\"  When I was going to therapy for it I'd go in on some days and according to the tests I'd be \"mild,\" the next week I might be \"extreme.\" Only you know what you're going through, but you deserve to seek help when you are struggling.

People actually come to me for advice and help when they have life struggles. I know I must be depressed. But still think that I just have to figure something out, and then I'll be ok. Worse still, my life right now isn't even the worse it's been. I've had worse times, yet 2 weeks ago I slit my wrists. For the first time ever. Never had I done that in all these years.

At finding every weakness, and exploiting it. Every insecurity, every foothold from which we can tear ourselves down even more. \n\nAnd like you, I was the guy everyone went to. At my last two places of employment, I was the guy anyone went to when they had a problem. Something broken? I could fix it. Love life issues? I could help. Just need to vent? I was the guy to talk to. Then I'd go home and drink until I blacked out because if I was sober I'd think about suicide all night long. What's funny is that, at the time, I was so convinced if I could just keep doing a little more, helping people or making people happy or whatever, eventually I'd be happy too. Like there was some quota I had to meet. And because I wasn't happy, I was never actually convinced I was making a difference to anyone. That anything I did mattered to anyone. \"Surely,\" I thought, \"I'll know when it's real because then I'll feel it.\" \n\nGo talk to some doctors, man. It was the best decision I ever made in my life. I've been medicated for about two years now and between that and therapy (which is less \"well, when I was 5 my parents told me I couldn't have pudding...\" and more \"okay, if this is something that bothers you, here are constructive ways to deal with that...\" in case you look at it like I used to) my life is so, so, ***SO*** much better than it was. \n\nThe depression doesn't exactly go away, and I'm bipolar so I'm basically stuck with mood instability unless I want to medicate myself into being a functional vegetable, but it means the difference between climbing a mountain with jeans, a t-shirt, and flip-flops versus climbing the same mountain with appropriate clothing, ropes, proper shoes, an O2 tank for the higher altitudes, and a ski-lift to take you about halfway up. \n\nAt the end of the day, who gives a fuck if someone else is worse off than you are?\n\nI was afraid of seeking help for almost 20 years because I was afraid if I did it would change me into someone else, or would take away who I was. Eventually I realized I *already* wasn't who I was because my mental problems had robbed me of the person I'd been. I was basically just a corpse with a job and taxes. At that point, what was really the worst I could do to myself? \n\nIf absolutely nothing else, talk to your primary care physician about it, and see if they have anyone they want to recommend you to, or maybe they can start you on a trial of something to see if it helps. Medications are best thought of like an investment, like your retirement. You'll probably be doing it forever, and it doesn't pay off right away, plus it takes time to dial in what's right for you, but it isn't as scary as the stigmas would have you think, you just have to listen to and trust your loved ones when they have feedback about if you seem different when you're on something, 'cause you won't necessarily notice it yourself.

It is a feeling you get regardless of whether you're poor or rich, or doing well in life or not.

It is an unfulfilled feeling with life in general which can escalate into suicide or self-harm.

If you are just in a shitty part of your life and you can't help but feel demoralized from moving forward, then you are depressed based on circumstance.

I would consider myself depressed based upon circumstance, and I wish life would be less cruel.

In which case, it wouldn't have served its purpose long, would have needed to be checked/cleared multiple times during high traffic times, and so would have pulled manpower away from where we needed it in order to keep the bathrooms clean and safe. I mentioned it to the manager to see if we could determine a solution and he said the same thing so no trash can was placed near the door since the value didn't outweigh the cost. \n\nBesides A) The amount of paper towels that an average person uses to dry their hands is wasteful (if you shake off the excess water you only need one towel, folded in 1/2 no mater the type; proof: https://youtu.be/2FMBSblpcrc ). So I didn't want to encourage using towels for drying hands, followed by getting more towels to open the door. B) If you don't feel comfortable using public restrooms with common decency (i.e. Not littering the floor with your garbage) then don't use the restroom. Your littering is just as disgusting as that door (which has been sanitized). The difference is someone now has to go clean up your trash (which isn't sanitary). I'm sorry the bathroom door grosses you out but, to put it frankly, our world is disgusting. If you're grossed out by public restrooms you should also stop chewing gum. It's almost as disgusting as licking the toilet bowl yet many people chew gum not ever worrying about it. I'll let you fact check that one on your own. \n\nTLDR: You're not creating a solution by dropping the towels on the floor, you are creating an unsafe and unclean environment for all others using the facilities. If you see an issue and have a solution, you are also just as capable of bringing it up to the manager.

Also, it's important to not have other distractions in the room with you as your mind will try to focus on both things at the same time until one mental task wins.\n\nCharacter did this, because of this. These characters began a conversation. So on, and such. After a while you can start to do it for each page. The less you space out while reading, the less you'll have to do this.\n\nNow I typically don't do this for novels, anymore (unless it's The Fairie Queene), but I will for textbooks. Really, the best thing to do with textbooks (since you're probably reading them for class) is to take notes while reading. Important names, words, or occurrences. Just jot down a few words (you won't need the whole thing, but this will help for the recalling of information later). Later, if you look over your notes you'll have stronger mental connections with the information you've gone over. Then it's all about learning what types of quizzes or exams your professor will give, and just adjust the notes you take while reading accordingly.\n\nNow, for the comments about this happening while driving I haven't a good method of not spacing out while driving. The issue really is that we're dreamers and love to live in our thoughts. Driving with the with the window down kind of helps if the wind is affecting you, as the feel of something against your skin can help keep you grounded in reality.
