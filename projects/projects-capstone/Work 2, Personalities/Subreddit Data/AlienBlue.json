This is why even Jase had slowed updates to only once a year. It was simply too much of a headache. So, Reddit decided the best thing to do was start a new app from scratch. One where they could build a solid foundation for providing ongoing updates. \n\n\n>- How many people were there in the AB team?\n\nOriginally? Just Jase. \n\n\n>- How long approximately did it take to develop the barebones of AB\n\nAB has a lot of features.

Reddit? \n\nReddit does.\n\n\n>- How much would it cost to create an maintain a clone? \n\nThat's pretty much impossible to answer.

With their new app, there is no one time fee to get rid of ads. That means that in order to have an ad free experience on Reddit, it will now cost you $36 per year.  If AB wasn't popular, I'd imagine that Reddit never would have given it a second thought but AB was cutting into Reddit's ad revenue.  \n\nTl;dr: Reddit wants more money. \n\nEdit:  Made a mistake on pricing. Here's the run down:\n\n1 Month - $3.99\n3 Months - $11.97\n12 Months - $29.99\n24 Months - $59.98\n36 Months - $89.97"], [99, "Reddit had a different CEO when they bought Alien Blue. The new CEO that replaced that CEO evaluated the situation, decided that Alien Blue did not fit in with the company's evolving mobile strategy, partly because its Pro model did not support a steady revenue stream, and thus directed the mobile development team to begin working on a new cross-platform app and to retire Alien Blue. \n\nThe new CEO changed course. You may not agree with their decision, but it really isn't terribly complicated. \n\nI personally suspect that of the new CEO had a time machine he would have gone back and canceled the AB acquisition altogether, or to have changed the iPhone version's model at that time to an Ad/Gold supported model instead of a Pro purchase one (as was done with the iPad version). But time machines don't exist, so this was the plan they came up with. "], [29, "Software developer here. Another reason could be the poor code base for long term maintenance. They may not have realized till after they bought it that it was a mess and would be harder to develop new features for and maintain than just rewriting the program from scratch. I actually think this is fairly likely given it was developed by some dude and not a software company. It likely had poor practices in place and lacked things like unit tests etc.\n\nFurthermore, it's likely written in objective c which has sort of been replaced by swift. Reddit might not want to have to hire engineers for objective c when swift is the new thing going forward."], [26, "I think originally they were going to keep Alien Blue updated.

But it was branded improperly and they really just wanted their own app made in-house called \"reddit\" (one of the devs said this in an AMA). \n\nThe reason the app is substandard is debatable. The devs have stated that most of the features omitted from Alien Blue will be added in future updates.

You can't go to the CEO and say \"please pay our salaries for two years while we rewrite the whole app from scratch and at the end you will get what you have right now with maybe some new features\" - obviously, in the rewrite we would remove technical debt and so on, but you'll appreciate the business won't go for it.\n\nWhat I have done successfully, and many others in many businesses with the same problem - because let's face it, Alien Blue is not the only app in the world where someone has said \"I want to start from scratch\" - is to refactor, moving it piece-by-piece to better code, a new model, service-oriented architecture, whatever the goals are - but without loss of functionality.\n\nIt is achievable, and would have been a superior decision than deciding to release something with massively less functionality than what it replaced.\n\nTo be truthful, it makes me think the devs who made the decision to rewrite from scratch lack industry experience and lack commercial savvy.\n\n\nEDIT: Downvotes eh?

Really only exist to go to/from a post to the feed it came from.\n\n- Night mode in general isn't really though out. Only the comment bodies and post titles are easily readable, everything else is way too dark of a shade of grey. And to top it off, reddit has *insisted* on putting a *bright orange* symbol for the main tab. So not only do they make the text too dark to easily read, they've put an obnoxiously bright orange symbol in one corner that can't be dismissed if you're on the front page.\n\n- No editing symbol (To be fair, AB didn't show them either). \n\n- The main feed is 'Front' with exactly zero way to change it.\n\n- If you use the caret symbol instead of a dash to make a bullet list, the app completely misinterprets the markdown and tries to italics everything instead (Should probably fix this one soon)\n\n- Doesn't show comment flairs\n\n- Strikethrough, predictably, doesn't work at all.\n\n- No optimal view of any kind. If you open an imgur link in the comments, it'll switch to a new page which is nothing more than a browser view of imgur.com.\n\n- No thumbnail support for comment links (How will I prevent myself from getting rickrolled now?)\n\n- subreddit list *insists* on showing /r/ before every subscription for no reason whatsoever.\n\n- Can't view karma on your own individual comments without actually going into the tread it was posted in (i.e; it shows you a list of your comments, but if you want see how it did, you've got to click on it and go to the thread to do that).\n\n- Somebody put Material Design in my iOS app. \n\nLike almost every other reddit app I've tried, it's very pretty, smooth and solid, but doesn't do much and lacks features.

It's the quickest way, by far, to browse non-text content. It has issues with imgur albums loading as single images with the same ID - usually porn instead of whatever it was supposed to be, and with going between multiple screens breaking the swipe gestures. I've documented these several times to the AB developers but nothing has been done about it.\n\nWhen reading comment threads, there are almost always child comments that are completely gone from the thread in AB and there is no way that I've found to view them. If I go into a thread and the top comment is at +1000, but it loads zero child comments, I can tell that it's because AB has loaded other top-level comments instead of child comments on the post, and has reached some limit in its loading ability. I'd like to be able to choose to expand a single comment thread and see its child comments in this case.\n\nContent filtering is also a must. I don't always want to see a certain sport's subreddit posts and whatnot, and being able to filter those in AB is a godsend when /r/all is filled with posts about football or anything else. It's my primary reason for using RES, as well. Hopefully there will be a filter list available in the new app, as well.", "id": "d04xvo9"}, {"comment": ">When reading comment threads, there are almost always child comments that are completely gone from the thread in AB and there is no way that I've found to view them.\n\nTwo-finger swipe across a comment and it will load the child comments in a new window.

Obviously, client side hashing is far, far, better though.  Encoding in the URL is pretty bad practice too, for all kinds of reasons - but again, hardly unusual.\n\nAnother problem is this thread is full of people who have now identified themselves as using a password that includes the limited number of characters that require URL Encoding (it's not a lot of characters), which reduces their password entropy now that anyone trying to guess the password knows some information about its nature.  OP should have requested PMs really, but was rightly more concerned with getting an embarrassing bug hot fixed (forgetting how public a forum this is).  It really isn't that big an issue as using special characters increases the entropy in the first place, which more than balances it out.  A bigger deal would be people posting 'I didn't notice any problems', as that would indicate they didn't use any of the characters, so no upside for them, just less entropy.  If I were a mod (which I have no desire to be), I'd probably be deleting comments which identified a user as being in either camp, out of an abundance of caution.  Further, I just wouldn't have been as public about the nature of the fix, as laudable as transparency is, this was probably not the best time to exercise it.\n\nFor all these reasons, you should always use a unique random password per site and then it doesn't really matter if it's sent in clear text (client side hashing doesn't normally prevent replay attacks anyway unless you use temporaly mutating salts).\n\nIn answer to your question though, from the nature of the bug, it's a pretty probable yes...\n\nTL;DR yup", "id": "cy5a26i"}, {"comment": "Some very good points, I hadn't considered that it's an https stream, so I guess it's not technically actual plain text, but it still feels wrong.\n\nInteresting thoughts too, thanks for the thought provoking reply", "id": "cy5c3iw"}], [{"comment": "Mine is still bricked.

Some of the bugs you are referring to are literally years old - there is absolutely no rational reason to believe those bugs are going to ever be fixed.

That version was the first version of the Alien Blue iPhone app that had ads, and if you paid for the Pro upgrade you were told that you would turn off all ads forever. Now, when Reddit decided to give up on AB and also switch from a one-time payment to a subscription model for turning off ads, they realized that they were probably going to have a bunch of pissed of customers that paid for the Pro version of Alien Blue and who probably assumed that \"turn of ads forever\" meant something longer than \"until we discontinue the app in 18 months.\" Now legally they didn't need to do anything, since the Pro upgrade only promised that ads would be turned off in the Alien Blue app, and it never specified hoe long that app would continue to be supported.
