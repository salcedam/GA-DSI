Being able to save money, even slowly, is a vital part of getting people out of needing welfare.\n\n* Letting them build an emergency fund will allow them to be able to deal with basic financial crises without immediately falling back onto the welfare rolls.  The obvious \"Car broke, can't afford to fix, can't get to work reliably, fired, on welfare again\" narrative, for example.  But also the ability to avoid the use of some expensive credit  (payday loans or rent to own shops).\n\n* Saving for education.  Maybe you don't/can't take out strudent loans, but need to save up a few thousand dollars to attend a trade school or pick up a certification.  Or even attempts to save for their children's education.\n\n* Working towards a down payment may allow people to exit a cycle of ever-increasing rent and poor-quality rental housing.\n\n* Everyone should be encouraged to save towards retirement.\n\nThere may be a few sanctioned strategies for some of this-- I think some educational and retirement savings plans don't qualify for asset tests for most welfare programs, but 1) I doubt most recipients are fully schooled on where they can put their money and 2) not everyone-- particularly if you don't have much money to work with-- can deal with the restrictions of some of those plans.  The \"you can't cash out your IRA til you're almost retired without taking a pounding from the revenuers\" rules make it a non-starter if you can't say \"I'm financially sound enough to be able to leave this money there til I'm almost 60\"\n\nRegulations saying \"You can only have a token sum in savings at any time\" seem designed to encourage short-term thinking and a lack of money management.  In that situation, if you gave someone on welfare $3000 in cash, they're better off blowing it on stupid crap, so it never lands in their bank account long enough to affect their qualifications for benefits that, over time, will be worth more than $3000.", "id": "d454oni"}, {"comment": "If you have 30,000 in cash to spend on a car, you should not be living on welfare.

She works in a district with a lot of low income kids.  Around 90% of them are on assistance, so they get free breakfast and lunch at the schools.\n\nNow, these kids who are too poor to afford breakfast are always picked up and dropped off in blinged out SUVs.  Ones that cost $50,000 to $80,000 to purchase.  They have extensive AV systems inside and some have $10,000 or more of wheels and rims on them.  I've seen it myself.  It's amazing.  A few **million** dollars of automotive purchases roll through to pick up kids who can't \"afford\" two dollars towards breakfast.\n\nMy sister drives an old minivan worth a few thousand.  Hey, it's good, safe transportation.  Her money paid for her Ed.D. and even more is going towards my niece who starts college in September.  \n\nPeople are in poverty because of the status symbols.  Plain and simple.  Every spare dime goes towards showy purchases.  They don't give a single flying fuck about education or improving job skills.  An extra $5,000 could pay for, say, a welding certificate at the community college.  That would lead to a really good, high-paying job.\n\nBut no.  That $5,000 goes towards rims.  Rims that will be worth like $400 after a few years.  That's why people don't get ahead.  They spend money on idiot crap that depreciates like crazy.\n\nFor a couple of years, I put every spare cent and even sold some of my stuff for something important to me.  No, that didn't go into my car.  No, it did not buy me $300 sneakers.  No, it did not buy me jewelry.  I would, about once a month, eat out.  Maybe $10 on a meal.

But I still think it's bullshit that the savings cap is comically low. You have to spend basically all of your savings. I get it, you don't want people with 100k saved away living off of the interest (even if low) receiving benefits. But when you save just a few thousand and your benefits get cut exponentially, it's a fucking joke. \n\nIf you're really poor, you're not allowed to have safety nets. \n\nAlso my favorite thing growing up was that state health insurance runs out when you hit 18. But as a single 18 year old you don't qualify for state insurance. So you either have to somehow find a way to pay ~$200 a month, or you go without insurance. And nowadays you'd get fined for not having insurance. Murica. (Not to mention deductibles and sometimes coinsurance) \n\nOh and if you as an 18 year old are poor and still live with your parents, you might think \"I'll just get a job and pay for my insurance!\" well, if you get a job, your parents benefits get cut. Because any money you earn has to go towards them. So yeah, it fucking sucks. If you work, your parents get less benefits, so your money has to go towards filling that gap. Turn 18, lose insurance, parents can't pay. Go to work to pay for insurance, most of your money will go towards that and helping your parents/family now. \n\nIt's pretty fucked up man. The amount of people that have no sympathy is incredible. \n\nI'm not defending the guy in this picture, if he had 30k saved away then he really should've been more responsible with it, and that is fraud imo. \n\nBut people get really heartless when it comes to poor people. You're not allowed to buy slightly more expensive healthy food or you're wasting your benefits and should be fined. You're not allowed to saver aside $30 for your kids birthday so you can all see his favorite movie franchise, because if you're poor, you're not allowed to have pleasures or entertainment.

Anyway, so she goes in the McDonald's bathroom and when she comes out, it's showing she's pregnant.\n\nI expected that the only answer was that she was going to get an abortion and I started assuring her that I wasn't going to be *that guy* and that I was going to come up with the cash for it and go with her down there so she's not alone.  Like I said, we did not break up bitterly and I was trying to hit all the bullet points on the script of what I should say and do in a situation like that to make the best out of a bad situation.  Also, I was born in the south but when I was 13 we moved to the west coast into an extremely liberal city, so I was raised around stuff like NARAL and abortion rights and all that and I just *assumed*.\n\nI don't think she earned it, but she affected a kind of country twang when she spoke and she also did a lot of talking that involved one-liners while she wasn't looking at you.  She had her bare feet up on the dash and she was looking down and in that twangy voice she said something pretty terse like \"Well, I don't think I'm going to get an abortion.\"\n\nAnd that was it.  I wasn't particularly freaked or anything at that point.  I went on to ask her a little bit about if she was sure it was mine and then back to offering to help with the abortion and being with her during the procedure and all that.\n\nWhen she dropped me off at my parents house, I really didn't have much to go on except a series of really blunt one-liners from her about her not getting an abortion.  She didn't bring up religion or fear of the procedure or anything specific.  Whatever the exact way she put it was pretty blunt and didn't have any \"heat\" behind it.  Not going to get an abortion.\n\nThis is the first time I've thought about that particular part of the conversation in many years and I guess now it's pretty clear to me that she knew she was pregnant and had, for whatever reason, made up her mind about not having an abortion long before we wound up in that McDonald's parking lot.", "id": "d3gipqn"}, {"comment": "Damn - well, now I guess she'll have to figure out how she's paying for that kid on her own.

Also explain why crime is near the lowest its ever been, yet police shootings and prison population keep rising? People blamed crime on the situation in black communities, but where I live crime is extremely low (nyc) and black people are still extremely impoverished here. The single biggest reason is urban segregation, which may have originated half a century ago but is even more rigidly enforced today than ever before. You can blame it on racial differences, but in the UK, which is also very multicultural, afro-caribbeans earn nearly as much as white people on average and are the largest black ethnic group. Its obviously not an inherent racial thing. \n\nAlso the Baltimore report also reports that something like 5% of arrests actually resulted in a charge, meaning people are being picked up and arrested for nothing, typically groups of people roaming around that get taken away to bookings.

Yes, having a baby can cause damage to the birth canal from stretching, straining, and tearing. It is common for a woman's pelvic floor muscles, which gives the sense of tightness near the opening of the vagina, to be stretched after birth. Some woman bounce back, others may take a few months to a year, still others may encounter more severe damage. All kinds of factor play into these circumstances such as health, height, weight, size of the baby, number of births, time between birth, and genetics. In general, the vagina isn't destroyed so much as the PC muscles are injured and need rehab/strengthening through kegels to achieve a similar strength level pre-birth. \n\nEver had an injury that, once healed, left your body weaker?

Most people I know genuinely see the flag as southern pride. Just as you may hear an American say \"I'm proud to be an American,\" it's almost like saying (or is saying) \"I'm proud to be a southerner.\" There's a national flag, there's a flag for every state, and unofficially for the deep south there is a \"regional flag\" known as the Battle Flag (or incorrectly known as the Stars and Bars). There's a cultural difference between the north and south for sure, but I won't get into the details as I'm trying to keep this short (edit: well fuck) and Google most likely has the answers anyway. \n\nBut yes some people do see the flag as an expression for racism and they get the most attention from the media when they do terrible things (the news networks get a majority of their views from bad events, not heartwarming events so keep that in mind). Then people who honestly see the flag as a symbol of southern pride get branded as racists. I know a few of them who don't have a racist bone in their body and they get branded as one, ironically one time by a northerner who ***was incredibly racist*** (the type of person who says \"I'm not racist but (insert jaw-dropping racist comment here)\" lol) yet found the flag as inappropriate. The flag symbolism varies between southern pride and racism. I know when Mississippi changed their flag with the Battle Flag a few decades after the war, it was with racist intentions. \n\nI personally don't get offended by it and I never have, but then again the idea of a flag offending me is stupid [unless it was something like this \\(though on South Park it had me laughing my ass off\\)](http://images.tvfanatic.com/iu/v1371156286/racist-south-park-flag.png). But then again compared to people in the north, I've seen the flag almost every day or every other day on people's vehicles and whatnot. Yes, I know the flag was part of the Confederacy, yes I know the war was literally over slavery, so yes I know it's confusing. Colleges are different than one another, and have their own symbol. Major religions are different than one another, and have their own symbol. The south has always been seen as different than the north, in many ways including culture so some I suppose felt they needed some symbol to represent pride on where they come from. Though I do believe racist intentions were originally behind it, I think those racist intentions have faded for the most part (again, there's still some people who use the flag as a symbol for racism).  \n\nI think you would have to live in the south to understand. Some people still think it's racist or it's not regardless. Honestly, unless the flag in question is Old Glory ( <3 ), I don't care about it. I'm indifferent to the Battle Flag and its potential symbolism because I have better things to do than worry about a flag that doesn't affect me. Like college, video games, my future career, being alive, etc. I think it means what you want it to mean, ***and there is nothing wrong with that.***\n\nOh and some people like the flag for another reason that I left out; Because being a rebel is \"cool.\" Personally I find this reason to be stupid because we're not fucking kids playing with toy guns but that's just me. You're free to think what you want. \n\n^^^Currently ^^^waiting ^^^for ^^^an ^^^edgy ^^^redditor ^^^to ^^^say ^^^something ^^^stupid\n\nEdit: Thanks to /u/AlliFitz for mentioning something that I failed to clarify and mention.

For that matter, should Germany have renamed themselves and disavowed literally anything that was a recognizable symbol?  They did to an extent, because Nazi insignias/memorabilia is banned in Germany (which I disagree with as well, but that's an argument for another day), but not every single symbol and moniker of that time.  And more importantly, this country never banned the battle flag after the war and so nobody here could even try to make perhaps the strongest argument for doing so, which would be that allowing citizens to fly the flags and display the insignia of the enemy would carry with it a potential for a new rebel insurrection.

You can see the mediocre plastic surgery work on some of their faces, too. They're openly racist and homophobic and basically refuse to speak to anyone who isn't Russian speaking or wealthy. Money can buy expensive clothing, but it can't buy taste. The obvious flaunting of designer brands reminds of \"hood-rich\" rappers. People who are \"new money\" are known to be ostentatious. \n\nWith that being said, I recently starting seeing one of these girls and hanging out with her friends and clique.

"], [9, "It's shit. Granted we weren't as flashy like that, but replace everything immaterial in your life with something material, remove all of its value, and convince yourself that being surrounded by worthless baubles makes you happy- there's the key difference there for the inevitable \"LOL I'D SURE BE HAPPY IN A PRIVATE JET\" comments, we're hunter-gatherers at heart and the pursuit will always be more rewarding than the meal.\n\nReplace all of your friends with gimme-gimmes. If they aren't, their families are. You go to hang out with them and their uncle comes along. He educates you on his business idea and you compare it to everyone else's. Your friend is visibly embarrassed and won't speak to you again, but that doesn't have much of an impact because you've gone through so many in the past year alone that you've made a game of guessing what they're going to say. If they don't have an uncle, it will be their business idea and all hell will break loose if you don't believe in a fourteen year-old's vision for a nightclub *on. a. zeppelin. mate.*\n\nReplace the women you meet with gold diggers. Gold diggers are different from gimme-gimmes because gold diggers aren't bought by object, only by status. They've fetishised money and caste to a religious level and if you don't bring them both their eyes shut off and their exit will be marked with such a profound 180 in personality that you'll incrementally lose the ability to trust people. Either you'll give up and accept hollow relationships with women who love your name but don't know the person behind it or you'll take to dating crazy women, as they're rubbish at bluffing. \n\nReplace parents with staff and parenting with bribes. Congrats, you have someone washing your clothes and cooking your food. They're not allowed to look at you or speak with you unless it's in a tone that's incredibly demeaning toward themselves. They wouldn't want to anyway because they too know they're cooking and cleaning for you and they hate that. They didn't want to grow up to have that job, but they do and their best response is to take it out on you. You'll overcompensate, cook fucking feasts before you hit age ten just to say \"you don't need to do this for me\", but if they don't they'll be punished so they do. You're left with five mums and five dads, none of which would bat an eye if you were to choke on the sandwich they made for you even though you've made it as clear as you can that you too can and would like to make a sandwich if they wouldn't keep locking the kitchen doors.\n\nYou can go anywhere in the world and see nothing at all. Travel is a hotel room, and the only thing separating Paris from Beirut is the kitschy shit on the walls. If you go outside, you risk being kidnapped. That's not paranoia, that's a thing. It's a thing you actually have to worry about because someone who isn't you has made you a target of people you don't know so that they can feel good about their own choices in life. If you do manage to get away from the hotel, every single person you meet sees you as a foreigner no matter where you are or what language you're speaking. Again, Paris, Beirut, your own city. You are different and they will let you know this in more ways than Disney has dalmatians. \n\nLife is meaningless. You can be anything you want or nothing at all. There's no challenge, there's no game, there's no \"if I do this and this and this I'll have the biggest damn boat EVER ^^^inadecade \". If you want a boat, you buy a boat. If you want to be a doctor, you become a doctor. If you want to suck dad's money teat, drink your fill and you'll become whatever he wanted you to become when he planned your birth for the explicit purpose of carrying on his name and his business and has made this very clear in his only real interactions with you.\n\nBut if you want to be anything *but* what he wants you to be or something equally prestigious, god help you. Be a doctor but no hospital will take you if you go into public medicine. Psychology is fine but if you work with crazy people you'll be disowned. Animals, lovely. Work with cute ones and have someone under you to clean up after them because if they shit you'll find them dead the next morning. \n\nOnly have an abstract view of family, of worth, of ethics, and of normalcy. Hesitate before you say anything to anyone who isn't of the same background because at best you'll come off as either a compulsive liar or nutter, and at worst as someone different. Consider every action from a dozen different angles before you undertake it because on some level your brain doesn't quite understand the idea of consequence and you don't know if something is wildly risky or just fun.\n\nKeep a spare change of clothing in your backpack and duck behind a tree every time you're out of sight from your house. Change your accent, it's as telling as anything. Change your vocabulary, your interests, your hair, your name if you can pull it off. Walk through the field to get to the council homes to get to the shoddy street to get to the better street to get to the school, even though you'd otherwise just walk down the street to the school from your own house. If \"friends\" follow you home, you'll be outed the next day and have to take another year of boarding school because they'll make your life hell unless given time to forget you.\n\nEscape your family, escape your childhood, escape your country, escape you. You're still branded for life and anyone who is the least bit perceptive can smell you from a mile away. Have your failed relationships because you wanted love and she wanted a steady cheque, your failed friendships because you wanted acceptance and they wanted insurance, and your failed life because no matter what you end up doing the voice in the back of your mind says \"Do it well, do it shit, you're covered.\" \n\nBreak out entirely, burn every bridge you've ever crossed, sweep that one girl who's just warped enough to not get blood on her teeth off her feet, run away to a city where you can guarantee no one will ever recognise you, and maybe just maybe you'll have a place and a person and a purpose just tangible enough to let you breathe for the first time in twenty-one years and think, \"What now?\"\n"], [7, "r/latestagecapitalism"], [12, "People like this will never be happy, a large percentage of rich kids are depressed, suicidal, opiate addicted, jailed, etc. Don't worry, they receive their rewards."], [2, "Can she not afford water for her bath?

", "id": "d1xs8qt"}], [{"comment": "It's shit. Granted we weren't as flashy like that, but replace everything immaterial in your life with something material, remove all of its value, and convince yourself that being surrounded by worthless baubles makes you happy- there's the key difference there for the inevitable \"LOL I'D SURE BE HAPPY IN A PRIVATE JET\" comments, we're hunter-gatherers at heart and the pursuit will always be more rewarding than the meal.\n\nReplace all of your friends with gimme-gimmes. If they aren't, their families are. You go to hang out with them and their uncle comes along. He educates you on his business idea and you compare it to everyone else's. Your friend is visibly embarrassed and won't speak to you again, but that doesn't have much of an impact because you've gone through so many in the past year alone that you've made a game of guessing what they're going to say. If they don't have an uncle, it will be their business idea and all hell will break loose if you don't believe in a fourteen year-old's vision for a nightclub *on. a. zeppelin. mate.*\n\nReplace the women you meet with gold diggers. Gold diggers are different from gimme-gimmes because gold diggers aren't bought by object, only by status. They've fetishised money and caste to a religious level and if you don't bring them both their eyes shut off and their exit will be marked with such a profound 180 in personality that you'll incrementally lose the ability to trust people. Either you'll give up and accept hollow relationships with women who love your name but don't know the person behind it or you'll take to dating crazy women, as they're rubbish at bluffing. \n\nReplace parents with staff and parenting with bribes. Congrats, you have someone washing your clothes and cooking your food. They're not allowed to look at you or speak with you unless it's in a tone that's incredibly demeaning toward themselves. They wouldn't want to anyway because they too know they're cooking and cleaning for you and they hate that. They didn't want to grow up to have that job, but they do and their best response is to take it out on you. You'll overcompensate, cook fucking feasts before you hit age ten just to say \"you don't need to do this for me\", but if they don't they'll be punished so they do. You're left with five mums and five dads, none of which would bat an eye if you were to choke on the sandwich they made for you even though you've made it as clear as you can that you too can and would like to make a sandwich if they wouldn't keep locking the kitchen doors.\n\nYou can go anywhere in the world and see nothing at all. Travel is a hotel room, and the only thing separating Paris from Beirut is the kitschy shit on the walls. If you go outside, you risk being kidnapped. That's not paranoia, that's a thing. It's a thing you actually have to worry about because someone who isn't you has made you a target of people you don't know so that they can feel good about their own choices in life. If you do manage to get away from the hotel, every single person you meet sees you as a foreigner no matter where you are or what language you're speaking. Again, Paris, Beirut, your own city. You are different and they will let you know this in more ways than Disney has dalmatians. \n\nLife is meaningless. You can be anything you want or nothing at all. There's no challenge, there's no game, there's no \"if I do this and this and this I'll have the biggest damn boat EVER ^^^inadecade \". If you want a boat, you buy a boat. If you want to be a doctor, you become a doctor. If you want to suck dad's money teat, drink your fill and you'll become whatever he wanted you to become when he planned your birth for the explicit purpose of carrying on his name and his business and has made this very clear in his only real interactions with you.\n\nBut if you want to be anything *but* what he wants you to be or something equally prestigious, god help you. Be a doctor but no hospital will take you if you go into public medicine. Psychology is fine but if you work with crazy people you'll be disowned. Animals, lovely. Work with cute ones and have someone under you to clean up after them because if they shit you'll find them dead the next morning. \n\nOnly have an abstract view of family, of worth, of ethics, and of normalcy. Hesitate before you say anything to anyone who isn't of the same background because at best you'll come off as either a compulsive liar or nutter, and at worst as someone different. Consider every action from a dozen different angles before you undertake it because on some level your brain doesn't quite understand the idea of consequence and you don't know if something is wildly risky or just fun.\n\nKeep a spare change of clothing in your backpack and duck behind a tree every time you're out of sight from your house. Change your accent, it's as telling as anything. Change your vocabulary, your interests, your hair, your name if you can pull it off. Walk through the field to get to the council homes to get to the shoddy street to get to the better street to get to the school, even though you'd otherwise just walk down the street to the school from your own house. If \"friends\" follow you home, you'll be outed the next day and have to take another year of boarding school because they'll make your life hell unless given time to forget you.\n\nEscape your family, escape your childhood, escape your country, escape you. You're still branded for life and anyone who is the least bit perceptive can smell you from a mile away. Have your failed relationships because you wanted love and she wanted a steady cheque, your failed friendships because you wanted acceptance and they wanted insurance, and your failed life because no matter what you end up doing the voice in the back of your mind says \"Do it well, do it shit, you're covered.\" \n\nBreak out entirely, burn every bridge you've ever crossed, sweep that one girl who's just warped enough to not get blood on her teeth off her feet, run away to a city where you can guarantee no one will ever recognise you, and maybe just maybe you'll have a place and a person and a purpose just tangible enough to let you breathe for the first time in twenty-one years and think, \"What now?\"\n", "id": "d1xj4kp"}, {"comment": "I knew I'd read this before:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/rage/comments/12uigr/rich_kids_of_instagram_im_pretty_well_off_but/c6z34w9\n\nDecent writeup tho", "id": "d1xji95"}], [{"comment": "r/latestagecapitalism", "id": "d1xg5t4"}], [{"comment": "People like this will never be happy, a large percentage of rich kids are depressed, suicidal, opiate addicted, jailed, etc. Don't worry, they receive their rewards.", "id": "d1xcelw"}], [{"comment": "Can she not afford water for her bath?

The 50 and 10 cent coins have an identical ribbed side, but the size difference makes it easy to tell them apart. The 20 cent coin has a smooth side with only a few indents, making it easy to spot when not seeing the face.

They are only used in a few cities, in this case Boston.  Most cab drivers here lease a medallion from whoever owns it, usually a big taxi company.  The city strictly limits the number that are allowed to exist, so they are worth a small fortune.  \nThe woman I'm talking about inherited hers from her husband, who drove a cab for decades, back when medallions were mostly owned by the drivers.  To her it means financial security forever- she basically collects rent from whoever drives the taxi with her medallion number on it.  \nShe doesn't own the taxi itself, but she owns the right for that taxi to operate.  If she calls the guy and says, \"Come get me,\" he'll be right there.  It's pretty unusual for an individual to own a medallion now, and for the record, she gives the guy a great deal.

But usually when things are shady as fuck and smell like bullshits, its because they are.\n\nAnd all of these accusations are happening days before the election, which is why they look shady as fuck. Nothing has changed about Trump, except that he is running for president. If they were so afraid why would they speak up now then? When it has been so long that there can be no evidence to support their claims if it were real and there is no reason to believe them.\n\nYou say the love of your life was raped and didnt tell anyone, but the thing is people who cry rape for attention undermine the reputation of the real victims and can completely ruin the life of the accused, which is why I dont and will not believe or support anyone without proof that they are not just trying to abuse the other person. Which brings us back to the porn star. It's not that she is a pornstar that sets off my bullshit alarm, because a lot of people are pornstars. It's not that she made a website for herself either or the accusation itself. It's the timing. It being days before the election is already questionable, but the site going up just before she makes the accusation - come on now. If this doesnt get your bullshit alarm through the roof, I dont know what will. At this point this person has a very good reason to lie, since he will make thousands of dollars off of it. And when someone makes an obvious bullshit claim like this one, it completely destroys the validity of all other claims as well, even if one of them might have been true.\n\nThis is why false accusations are cancer and should have serious consequences.\n\nAnd as far as victim blaming goes, although I havent seen it happen, I agree. Blaming the victim that they were asking for it is absolutely insane and I have no idea what is going on through the heads of people who believe this.

I also added him, and asked him directly but he has not responded. Idk if she was pulling my leg or what. She claimed that dude wanted to get famous off of it, and make ad revenue off of the video and I told her (and him) that the video had a tonne of interest already, so he would probably make some ad revenue. I really want to see it, and I have been getting messages every day about it. If by some chance she is not pulling my leg, and I do get the video, I will just create a new post altogether.

I give to you, R&R Stix. This place is absolutely impossible to describe but I will tell some unreal quick stories. But first, let me describe this place. Have you ever walked into a 1910 circus and walked from tent to tent looking at all the creeps locked in cages? No? Well you are in luck, they are all out of their cages and frequenting this bar. I tell people about this bar from hell and no one believes me....until I bring them there...\n\nThe first time I went there, I noticed there was a total of 6 teeth in the mouths of all the patrons combined (not including mine). There was a human roller skating around in a HUGE golf tshirt with what looked to be no pants on holding a can of creamed corn. I am not kidding. I still laugh about that to this day. Then, I was told by a friend of mine that the owner is in a little shack out back with like 400 security monitors in it just watching........so I went out back and sure as shit, a little yellow barn with 70 satellite dishes on top of it.\n\nI forgot to mention there are crusty dirty undies stapled to the roof everywhere. A swamp cooler blowing warm toilet water air into the building is shielded by a pair of yellowish brown mens hanes boxer briefs so you can make sure you are breathing that fart filter in at all times.\n\nI ALSO forgot to mention the bar tenders wear nothing but thongs and bras. If any man ever got turned onto the goblins that work here, take them behind the building and put them down. I get barfy even thinking about it.\n\nI pretended it was my birthday and had heard they did something called \"Tits On Fire\". The bartender told me SHE doesn't do it....but she had the perfect \"girl\" to do it. She opened up the furnace and pulled out what seemed to be a corpse but it was actually a living person. she put a match in each nipple, lit the matches, sang happy birthday to me and then I had to blow out the matches. I couldn't make something so outrageous up.\n\nthere are so many more stories I could blab on about but there's not enough time in the day.\nGet all of your friends, call an uber, make sure you have your entire camera photo album empty because you will take 300000 pictures to show your friends who wont believe the place was actually real, and go to Stix. I also suggest that you are boozed up first. It will help. trust me.", "id": "dae9d5o"}, {"comment": "That's Stix. Can confirm.

Mostly because my husband had taken to some other chick, who he immediately hooked up with after I was gone. I kept wanting to fix it because we had a family, but he was already hooked on this crazy bitch.\n\nAnd she did turn out to be crazy. An abusive alcoholic, totally fucked in the head, made his life miserable. But he had no spine at the time, so he just kept going along with it, finalizing the divorce because she wanted him to, while he was still crying about it every day. (I know I know!).\n\nAnyway, it came eventually to the point that he wanted out, but he was a chickenshit and she was crazynuts. So she had to be done away with. I gave my husband the chance to get rid of her himself, or I told him I would do it, and exactly when I would do it. \n\nHa! He didn't believe me. Surgical strike, their relationship is over in a ball of flames. We start getting our shit together and our life and family back on track. \n\nBut they had been engaged, you see (in less than a year). She already had the dress. She was still a psycho drunk. So she hired a professional photographer, put on a bunch of smeary makeup, and took a bunch of really shitty, dramatic pictures that she posted all over facebook. Oh, and she wrote a song, too. \n\nEpilogue: almost a decade later my marriage is still going great. She's had several teary, smeary arrest mugshots show up in our local rag after getting into domestic fights and shit.

I kept wanting to fix it because we had a family, but he was already hooked on this crazy bitch.\n\nAnd she did turn out to be crazy. An abusive alcoholic, totally fucked in the head, made his life miserable. But he had no spine at the time, so he just kept going along with it, finalizing the divorce because she wanted him to, while he was still crying about it every day. (I know I know!).\n\nAnyway, it came eventually to the point that he wanted out, but he was a chickenshit and she was crazynuts. So she had to be done away with. I gave my husband the chance to get rid of her himself, or I told him I would do it, and exactly when I would do it. \n\nHa! He didn't believe me. Surgical strike, their relationship is over in a ball of flames. We start getting our shit together and our life and family back on track. \n\nBut they had been engaged, you see (in less than a year). She already had the dress. She was still a psycho drunk. So she hired a professional photographer, put on a bunch of smeary makeup, and took a bunch of really shitty, dramatic pictures that she posted all over facebook. Oh, and she wrote a song, too. \n\nEpilogue: almost a decade later my marriage is still going great. She's had several teary, smeary arrest mugshots show up in our local rag after getting into domestic fights and shit.

Victims, commonly referred to as \"punks\" or \"bitches\", may or may not be seen as homosexual. \"Punks\" is a term for those who are generally confined to performing receptive sexual acts. Moreover, though \"punks\" are coerced into a sexual arrangement with an aggressor in exchange for protection, these men generally consider themselves heterosexual. \n  \nTIL, things got so bad in the U.S. prison system that they passed a federal law dealing with the issue:  \n[Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Rape_Elimination_Act_of_2003).   \n>(PREA) is the first United States federal law passed dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law on September 4, 2003.  \n\nAnd now thanks to you, when we are having our Father's Day get together this weekend on [September 4th](http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/new-zealand/father-day), I will be able to share this tidbit of information with the family.

One of them was a lady at the health dept that claimed to have minored in theology, and she said that she'd never, ever heard of the archangel Gabriel. I flat out told her that she was either lying through her teeth about having a minor in theology, or she didn't pay a damn bit of attention during any of her classes.\n\n*sigh* fucking idiots...\n\nEdit: Oh wow, I didn't even think to mention this, but when he was only a week old and I had to take him in for his very first doc appt at the health department, it was that SAME lady that put him in the fucking computer as female instead of male. I sat right there in the room and watched her do it, while my baby nursed at my breast in his blue clothes, with his blue blankie over my shoulder and everything for modesty's sake. There was even a blue \"IT'S A BOY!\" thingie still tied to his carrier from when we'd left the hospital four days prior.\n\nI sat there silently and waited until she'd finished and printed all of the paperwork and the chart stickers and *everything* before I said something, because in my way of thinking, if she's gonna be retarded, then I'm going to make her work harder and waste her time. That's when the whole \"I minored in theology\" discussion started and I wound up calling her a liar (or a lazy idiot), more or less. \n\nIt was so damn satisfying to sit there and watch her slog through and retype all of that corrected paperwork on that ridiculously slow, ancient, dinosaur of a late 90's computer. I reckon I wasted about 10 minutes of her time and it was worth every blessed second.\n\nEdit 2: Oh my, the downvote train sure as hell didn't take into account that I've had to deal with this woman for the last 11 years of my life, but to be fair, I didn't tell that part of the story, so here yall go: Before the Gabrielle incident, this woman was repeatedly incompetent at her job, wasted hours of my time--literally *hours* because I live 30 minutes away and she screwed up appointments in the computer, forcing me to turn around and go home on multiple occasions because there were no openings that day and I was still scheduled for an appointment but not in the MD's schedule book--and was just all-around unlikable, period. She was one of those that new everything about everything but was still incapable of doing her job at a mediocre level. Forget excelling at it. I even complained about her after the first couple times of giving her the benefit of the doubt and hoping she'd learn from her mistakes.

The dog gets his paws on a batch of chocolate chip cookies and earns himself a trip to the vet ER.\n\nThese are just three of any number of things that could go wrong during the course of the year. Recovering from any one will set you back about $500, which means these scenarios fall closer to the \u201cundesirable inconvenience\u201d category than they do the \u201cmassive calamity\u201d one. And yet, nearly two-thirds of Americans do not have enough money in savings to cover the cost of a single one of these unplanned expenses.\n\nAccording to a brand new survey from Bankrate.com, just 37% of Americans have enough savings to pay for a $500 or $1,000 emergency. The other 63% would have to resort to measures like cutting back spending in other areas (23%), charging to a credit card (15%) or borrowing funds from friends and family (15%) in order to meet the cost of the unexpected event.\n\nIt\u2019s not news that Americans are terrible savers. In November, Pew Charitable Trusts reported that one in three American families have no savings at all. In December, Magnify Money released the results of a study that found that 56.3% of people have less than $1,000 in their checking and savings accounts combined. Sensing a trend? You should: America\u2019s saving struggle has been a problem year after year after year. \n\nBut this latest survey is particularly striking because of the implications it carries.\n\n\u201cFive-hundred dollars is enough money that it could be catastrophic if you\u2019re really living on the edge and don\u2019t have enough money\u201d to cover that unplanned cost, Bankrate senior investing analyst Sheyna Steiner said in a phone interview. \u201dI did wonder what would happen if it was $10,000, what would the answer have been then?\u201d\n\nA $10,000 emergency is a somewhat rare occurrence for families of moderate income \u2014 but it\u2019s hardly unheard of. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts analysis, the median size of a family\u2019s most expensive financial \u201cshock\u201d (as they call it) in a year is $2,000. But Pew also found that the cost of emergencies actually varies by income: for households with an income of $25,000 or less, the median cost of the most expensive financial shock is $1,000, a figure that equates to 31 days\u2019 worth of income. As you move up the income spectrum, the median cost of unplanned expenses goes up, but the days\u2019 worth of income necessary to pay for that expense goes down. So for families making between $50,000 and $85,000, for instance, the median financial shock was $2,500 \u2014 or 13 days\u2019 worth of income. Families who reported $85,000 or more in household income were the ones most likely to see that $10,000 emergency, 26 days\u2019 worth of income:\n\n[image](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/maggiemcgrath/files/2016/01/pew-charitable-trust-income-hit-e1452115550987.jpg)\n\nBut that\u2019s the median size of a household\u2019s most expensive financial emergency. (How\u2019s that for a brain twister? Not the median cost of a financial emergency, but the median size of the most expensive financial emergency in a year.) Zooming out and looking at the most typical types of unplanned expenses that a family can experience throughout a year, Pew found that the most common was a car repair \u2014 which puts us back in the $500 to $1,000 realm that Bankrate used in its queries. The one that just 37% of people said they\u2019d pay for using savings.\n\nIf all of the above sounds like doom and gloom, there is a bit of a silver lining here: 23% of Bankrate respondents said they\u2019d pay for a $500 or $1,000 emergency by cutting back on non-essential spending, like eating out at restaurants and buying coffee from a coffee shop rather than home brewing. This indicates that there\u2019s a bit of elasticity in people\u2019s budgets.\n\nSteiner also noted that it is encouraging that people appear more likely to scrimp on other spending before resorting to the use of a credit card in the face of an unplanned event.\n\n\u201cIt was striking that so few people would just immediately put it on their credit card,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got a little wiggle room, maybe [a $500 unplanned expense] is just low enough that you could maybe lower your spending.\u201d", "id": "d6rw0dz"}, {"comment": "I couldn't afford to be that poor.", "id": "d6rpp69"}, {"comment": "Up vote for clever historic simile.", "id": "d6ri9z1"}, {"comment": "500?

I'm talking about when you get to the point of injecting heroin and your life is completely consumed by it. Not saying if you are a couple that has an opiate addiction you are most likely going to sell yourself, just that if you are \"bad enough\" into it is when it becomes almost normal. There's plenty of addicted people who snort heroin or even inject it without ever selling themselves and get out before their life is completely consumed and driven by it. These aren't the ones I'm referring to. \n\nEdit: I'm going by personal experience here. This may be anecdotal, but when I was an addict, literally every single couple that I met through my drug dealer was having their girlfriend suck his dick for heroin. I knew 5 addict couples and 5 of them had their girlfriend sucking the dealer's dick for heroin when they were sick enough. Sometimes the girl would even sneak over without the boyfriend knowing to get some for herself. I'm sure it could easily be the same situation but reversed if it was a female dealer that was open to it. They just weren't putting out ads and getting paid actual cash from other people like the actual dealer did to his girlfriend. It's a shitty situation but it happens all the time and becomes commonplace when you fall far enough into heroin addiction. Unless you have a Mr. GGG drug dealer, you're gonna be offered drugs in exchange for sex acts at some point when you are sick and it won't seem like the worst thing in the world at all if it means getting well. I'm sure there's plenty of others out there that have been down the rabbit hole and have seen this for themselves as well.\n\n\nEdit 2: To put this in better wording:\n\nI'm talking about the minority of drug users that are severely gripped by their addiction, like the top 10% in terms of severity.

Of course we never cleaned the interior of Mr. X's car and again, it was understood. One day Mr. X was in a particularly grumpy mood. We cleaned his car, outside only and brought it around.

I was about to hit the road and drive for a few hours, so I fueled up, and was grabbing some of those delicious jizz balls from Taco Bell. Waiting for my order to be completed, nature struck and I had to shit. Expecting the worst I went to the Taco Bell restroom but luckily it had just been cleaned minutes ago. A few minutes into my shit I hear a hard knock on the door. I decided to hurry it up because whoever was knocking probably had Taco Bell shits. I wouldn't wish that evil on even my worst enemy. After wiping with sandpaper I exited the restroom to find a man anxious to get in. This man had a black doo-rag on, a full \"grill\", a red leather jacket, and construction boots. After thinking to myself \"hmm\", I got my jizz balls from the counter and went to my car. Immediately upon exiting the building I was greeted by this spectacular feat of automotive engineering. It was necessary to take a photo. Placed my jizz balls on the ground, and waited for the camera to open. Before I could get the picture the passenger was going to the vehicle to get exact change for her meal, but it was too late and I wasnt about to walk away. Snapped the picture, went to my car, and ate while I waited to hear what the car sounded like. Luckily they left after getting their food. The car cranked and unleashed a James Bond smoke screen sounding as loud as a push lawn mower, and idling like a 2 stroke dirt bike. The occupants sat while they got thier radio playing. They switched to their favorite song which I can only assume was labeled \"RATTLE BASS\".

I was about to hit the road and drive for a few hours, so I fueled up, and was grabbing some of those delicious jizz balls from Taco Bell.

A few minutes into my shit I hear a hard knock on the door. I decided to hurry it up because whoever was knocking probably had Taco Bell shits. I wouldn't wish that evil on even my worst enemy. After wiping with sandpaper I exited the restroom to find a man anxious to get in. This man had a black doo-rag on, a full \"grill\", a red leather jacket, and construction boots. After thinking to myself \"hmm\", I got my jizz balls from the counter and went to my car. Immediately upon exiting the building I was greeted by this spectacular feat of automotive engineering. It was necessary to take a photo. Placed my jizz balls on the ground, and waited for the camera to open. Before I could get the picture the passenger was going to the vehicle to get exact change for her meal, but it was too late and I wasnt about to walk away. Snapped the picture, went to my car, and ate while I waited to hear what the car sounded like. Luckily they left after getting their food. The car cranked and unleashed a James Bond smoke screen sounding as loud as a push lawn mower, and idling like a 2 stroke dirt bike. The occupants sat while they got thier radio playing. They switched to their favorite song which I can only assume was labeled \"RATTLE BASS\".

What should I do?", "id": "d9je8fa"}, {"comment": "Have to disagree with my buddy who also commented.  I don't recommend /r/legaladvice for, well, legal advice.  You're *always* better off consulting an actual attorney in your area.  That said, I'll give you the quick and dirty.  \n\nSo...where you are in the world and what you're charged with make a big difference.  So, if its just a traffic matter, many places don't issue warrants for your arrest, but missing the date could result in increased fines or a driver's license suspension.  There is probably a method for either having the case reset or dealing with the missed court date.  Your best bet would be contacting the clerk of court in your jurisdiction and asking.\n\nIf its a criminal matter, its likely a warrant will be issued, or already was.  If that's the case, typically you'll have to either turn yourself in to clear the warrant or hire an attorney to have it re-calendared and the warrant recalled.  Either way, if its a criminal matter, you should get a lawyer.  If you can't afford one, one can be assigned (assuming you're in the US), but you won't get that opportunity until after you've turned yourself in and you appear before a judge to request one be appointed.  By that point, a bond will have already been set and if you can't post it, you'll be held until the court date.   That's part of why I suggested an attorney be hired.    There are times that my fee has basically paid for itself in saving my client money by getting a lower or unsecured bond.   Again, contacting the clerk usually can get you some info over the phone, if you're patient enough to sit through the automated options and get to a real person.  I recommend you start there.  \n\nIf you have additional questions or information to add, hmu.

We had sold 730 tickets for the afternoon show and approximately half of that for the evening show.\n\nThe artists and their friends they were travelling with were really nice and polite, despite of the fact that I'd actually heard bad things about them from some colleagues who'd worked with them at a festival.\n\nHowever, immediately after the concert starts, two 15 year olds start throwing shit on stage. The artists stop the show for a second to ask them to stop. They should never have done that, because as soon as the kids realized they might get attention for misbehaving, all hell broke loose. Eventually, some kids started spitting at one of the artists, in response to which he stormed out and sucker punched the little fuckers in the face (sweet fucking justice in my book).\n\nAfter the afternoon show, we had 25-30 kids kicking and screaming at the doors leading backstage. It was total chaos. I was barricading one door and my colleague the other, while we hoped they wouldn't realize there's actually a third door that's just harder to spot. We had one security guard on the stage to make sure they didn't attempt to get in that way (which they totally did, anyway, because they're brain-dead), but no idea where our second security guy was.\n\nAt one point, the guy barricading the door opposite of me shouts out: \"Where the fuck is security?\" (To the guy on stage) in response to which one of the wannabe tough guy friends pokes his head out of the band room and goes: \"I don't know, and I couldn't care less.\" After we get everyone out, my colleague goes to the band room - he's an army veteran, and not afraid of speaking his mind - and goes \"Who the FUCK just said that?\" Nobody replied. (10 against 1 and you can't even stand up for your own witty remark?)\n\nFor the evening show, we had quadruple security in bullet proof vests, and special permission to turn away people in the door at our discretion. This is usually a big no-no, both because of discrimination laws but also because anyone who has bought a ticket should expect to be admitted entrance. Even known/previously convicted criminals are allowed to enjoy music, you know. But that evening, it was considered a security threat. And there was violence everywhere in the city that night. We admitted approximately half of the people who had bought tickets. Even my colleagues who have been in the business since the 60's (including security) said they've never seen anything like that.

I remember being escorted into the service to see her body by my girlfriend, who kept telling me she was dead.\n\nThen I spent the next few weeks laying in bed and crying. My best friend finally convinced me to go out with him, and we went on a hike. On the way back to my house we pulled up behind one of these fuckheads who had a 'in memorial' sticker on his car for my sister.

That's our natural instinct, despite fedora-tipping \"le logical enlightened redditors\" insisting on the contrary.\n\nSo at the end of the day, maybe this whole hullabaloo over \"slut-shaming\" is nonsense- it's human nature to think pics like this are TMI, and to put sex in its own particular place where to be this open about it is appropriate. Maybe slut shaming isn't a political issue, it's just human nature (and plain manners, and common sense) not to be so explicit about sex in every single public context. This is gross to most people, plain and simple.\n\nIt's almost like a nudist insisting only people that are attractive to him get to be nudists and complaining about seeing too many old ugly fat men in the nude.

A lot of obese people are also depressed and eating is a coping mechanism. Of course, their weight is also a big factor in their depression, so their stuck in a viscous cycle.  \nIf you want to break that cycle, you have got to start at the depression. Somebody once told me; you've got to love yourself before you can help yourself. And that gets very difficult when your told daily that you're lazy, stupid and disgusting. Now, most people don't actually call you that, but that is where the depression and low self-esteem comes in.  \nMost fat people know how self destructive their behavior is, and don't need frequent reminders from their friends, family or random strangers on the internet. That's a job for doctors and the government. What people need to hear sometimes is \"It would  be fantastic if you can to loose weight, but if you fail I will love you the same.\" Because that is the thing most fat people don't realize.  \nLoosing weight is all about developing a healthy relationship with food. What you see a lot is that fat people go on very strict crash diets and starve themselves as a way to punish themselves for their sin of fatness. What usually happens is that they keep that up for a couple of weeks, crash and burn, and gain back all their weight.  \nI'm overweight and depressed (working on both, making progress on both), and I've noticed that the only time I'm able to loose weight is when I'm in a relatively good state of mind. My advice; encourage someone when they mention they want to loose weight. Otherwise don't bring it up. Nagging, confronting or joking about it doesn't help as much as you might think it does.

So, if they had made bacon, they'd stick it right up close to her face and taunt her \"I bet you won't eat this bacon, I bet you won't eat it!\"\n\nEventually she gave in, partially to make them stop and partially because she had heard it was better for her kid if she added a little meat to her diet. She basically forced herself to eat throughout the pregnancy.\n\nAfterwards, she stopped eating in front of people entirely and dropped to 92 lbs. At 5 foot 1 inch tall, she looked 14 at the age of 23. She eventually left that relationship, two years ago, and she's a lot better off for it. I think she's close to 110 lb, right in the middle of the healthy weight for her height.", "id": "d92fsfu"}, {"comment": "It starts off that way but often doesnt end that way. Imo experience, it was more about satisfying a need to be full and to allow myself to fall into a zombie state. While eating I tend to be in a state of calm and rarely think deeply so to sustain that placid state was all I could think about. Unfortunately I have severe anxiety so once the zombie state had worn off and I had realised what I had done, my anxiety would push me into a severe reaction of purging.\n\nI never really did it from a desire for the food itself.

In autumn, winter, and spring, these are merely disregarded as posts created by people who do not understand the meaning of quality content. In the summer, shitposts and terrible comments are submitted at a rate similar to shitposting in other seasons, but in this season users like to blame this issue on students out from school, not realizing that these shitposts and terrible comments are almost universally the products of shitposters who are active in the other seasons as well.", "id": "d4qqijg"}], [{"comment": "Her throwing that bike around reminds me of Paul Rudd in the cafeteria scene from Wet Hot American Summer.
