My boyfriend and I are working on that. Trying vibrators on my clitoris during sex, oral, going a week or two without masturbating, those kinds of things. I was recently able to cum during sex without any of my masturbation moves for the first time ever! I'm really lucky to have a partner who is enthusiastic about breaking my death grip problem.", "id": "cyr2t2q"}, {"comment": "Surprisingly, I can't even cum that quickly. Takes me at least a few minutes, and if I try to rush it just gets uncomfortable. I think everyone benefits from stretching out the time a little. \n\nWow. Congrats! I didn't know that could really happen, I'm very glad I didn't grip too tightly.\nYour boyfriend must be a patient man! I know many men and women that sex is virtually all about making themselves cum, and that's no fun at all.\nI hope you can fix the problem, is it a matter of clitoris stimulation? Can it be resolved by different positions at all?\n\nI think I realize that you've made me more curious about the death-grip problem!

Different states have different laws regarding misappropriation of name or likeness, but ultimately if challenged the Supreme Court would get to draw the distinction between what falls under the First Amendment and what doesn't.\n\n\"Misappropriation\nThe use of a person\u2019s name or likeness for commercial purposes without consent is misappropriation. The law protects an individual from being exploited by others for their exclusive benefit. A person\u2019s entire name need not be used. If the person could reasonably be identified, the misappropriation claim probably will be valid.13\nHowever, incidental references to real people in books, films, plays, musicals or other works, whether fact or fiction, generally are not misappropriations.14 Moreover, use of a photograph to illustrate a newsworthy story is not misappropriation. Even if a photo is used to sell a magazine on a newsstand, courts usually will not consider that use a trade or commercial purpose. The line between news and commercial use is not always clear, however, and even photographs used to illustrate an article may create liability for misappropriation if the article has an overriding commercial purpose.\"\n[https://www.rcfp.org/first-amendment-handbook/false-light-misappropriation-right-publicity](https://www.rcfp.org/first-amendment-handbook/false-light-misappropriation-right-publicity)  \n\nAnd /u/Darth_Mater gets downvoted into oblivion for actually trying to correct the spread of false information on reddit.

The original head mod was /u/relevant_rule34.\n\n> I've discussed the idea before, but I think it helps to reiterate it every once in a while. On the surface, Rule 34 seems like a hilarious idea; if it exists, there is porn of it. The humor lies in the shock and surreality of the moment for the average user stumbling upon the pornographic interpretation of an idea held dear.\n\n> And while I agree that it often times can be funny, the truth is that most of these are *not* being created as a joke. If Rule 34 really was just an anti-authoritarian 'rebel yell' of the internet, it would have passed into obscurity long ago. But we can see that it has been consistently happening since the dawn of the world wide web, and even longer before. Truth be told, the only difference between today and a few centuries ago is the means of distribution.\n\n> It's human nature to sexualize. For every conceivable person, concept, object or emotion there has been at least one person who got off thinking about it. There is no shame in that either; for we are merely prisms, refracting the energies of biology and evolutionary drive into a rainbow spectrum of sexuality. Yet despite the rich diversity of what is capable, we may sometimes feel forced to see the world, and even ourselves, through the colored lenses of a chosen few. This is no way to live your life. You will not feel whole without being at peace with your sexual identity, and you will not be able to love your fellow peoples as deeply without being able to truly see them. \n\n> Yes, that above is a picture of Donnie Darko kissing Frank the Rabbit, and it exists because someone out there truly enjoys the sentiment of the idea. Someone out there was moved by the characters, and so took it upon themselves to create from nothing, a way to express their desires and ultimately themselves. It is this form of expression that will ultimately reach across the spans of the internet to touch the soul of someone, somewhere who needs it the most. They may be an avid masturbator, comfortable and experienced with their wants and their body, or they may be in the midst of a sexual awakening, alone and terrified of the implications of their desires.

Some is real and some is faked. \n\nFor example, the TeasersVOD public stuff was all filmed in actual public, as far as I know. One of the guys was supposedly arrested at one point. More than once, their videos end with them being asked to leave by staff.\n\nFTV is filmed in and around Scottsdale, AZ. I recognize some of the locations. As far as I know, the dude isn't renting out venues and paying people to sit around as extras. I mean, I'm not TOTALLY sure, but there are moments, or outtakes where they're caught or almost caught. They're not usually trying to be seen, and it's sometimes in places you couldn't feasibly rent out, like airports or shopping centers.\n\nThen there's stuff like the multiple hardcore videos where a girl gets fucked on a public bus (dunno where those come from), which is just a porn set with a bunch of extras, or the video of the camgirl who \"squirts in class\" which is faked.\n\nSo it varies. If the scene is in a small, easy-to-charter venue, it's probably fake. If it's totally brazen, it might be faked ([unless it's somewhere like eastern europe, which has really lax public nudity laws](http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=091bdea4770892de572f)). If it's covert and in a large venue or public plaza, it's probably real.\n\nIt's about plausibility. If it costs more to book the place and hire extras than it does to take a small risk, then it's more likely they just took the risk.\n\nAnd release forms are just a CYA measure.

What's with reddit mods and not learning their lessons from meirl and such?\n\nThis is something that is brought up very frequently and while you'd be more correct in most other circumstances, niche porn subs do not follow the same train of thought.  This is because specialty NSFW subs such as HTM rely solely on OPs willing to create and submit pornographic GIFs, videos, and images of tailored content.  These OPs are much less likely to continually post in a subreddit with low subscriber count or karma gain.  Thus, a niche porn sub lives or dies based entirely on one factor: *activity*.  \n\nHad HTM not appealed to the majority, it would not have garnered the following it has today--in fact, it stagnated for [several months](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/wiki/index#wiki_moans.2C_redefined.) this way in the beginning.  Instead, there are currently over **1 million** [unique visits](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/about/traffic) to HTM / month.  Despite this, there are only **33** [total users](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/wiki/index#wiki_the_htm_leaderboard.) who frequently post content.  These numbers are the largest HTM has reached to date, and yet the participation rate is barely 1 in 30,000 users.

Then public sex was introduced.  Then professional scenes with HTM thematic elements started to appear.  Then public flashing began to trend.\n\nEvery single step of the way there was criticism with the direction HTM was heading.

The idea that leaving the rules up to the users would yield unsatisfactory results is inaccurate.  For example, we found that the inclusion of `Shameless` posts was met with a largely negative response.  These posts were not as highly upvoted, had <80% upvote percentages, and provoked dissent in the comments that were highly upvoted (top comment, unanimous agreement).  As moderators we were happy to then enforce this notion of prohibiting `Shameless` content, the official post of which you can read up on here:\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/comments/3enyis/content_policy_change_htms_getting_back_to_its/\n\nWe actually have 33 rules that we would hate to imagine HTM without:\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/holdthemoan/wiki/index#wiki_rules_of_htm\n\nHTM's identity, whatever it may be or become, is up to the subscribers to decide.

Whatever perceived \"ego\" you seem to be interpreting is all but imagined, as we have no personal connection to these statistics.

We did a few dances and she was getting herself all worked up, pulling her g string aside and showing me her little snatch, rubbing her button, etc. she was also manhandling my dick so I was rock hard. Before I knew what was happening, my dick was out for Harambe, she grabbed a rubber out of her purse, and sat on my cock. When I came she took the condom off, tied it in a knot, and dropped it behind the booth.\n\nShortly after I came, they were calling her to the main stage. She asked me for the $80 for the dances.

You don't go to the right (or wrong) strip  clubs.\n\nI will tell you a story - I was in a strip club here in Dallas a few years ago - let's call it \"Smilver Smitty\". It was a quiet Tuesday afternoon. I was one of a very few people in the club, and I drank and paid the girls not much mind. Eventually I went out to smoke and there was a girl sitting and smoking. We started chatting, she came to sit with me, I bought her a drink and we talked for a while longer. I broke out my dab pen and we did some discreet hits on the patio while we chatted. We went back in, and after one dance on the floor, we went to vip. We did a few dances and she was getting herself all worked up, pulling her g string aside and showing me her little snatch, rubbing her button, etc. she was also manhandling my dick so I was rock hard. Before I knew what was happening, my dick was out for Harambe, she grabbed a rubber out of her purse, and sat on my cock. When I came she took the condom off, tied it in a knot, and dropped it behind the booth.\n\nShortly after I came, they were calling her to the main stage. She asked me for the $80 for the dances. I gave it to her and she kissed me and split. \n\nNot a one time incident for me either. \n\n", "id": "d6i4zv8"}, {"comment": "> my dick was out for Harambe\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n", "id": "d6jvr3e"}, {"comment": "There is a sub here devoted to Harambe, and Their catchphrase is \"dicks out for Harambe\" - I was being meta", "id": "d6kbp7p"}], [{"comment": "Bruh that looks so much like [Michael Fisher (Mr Mobile)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fkSBoL-Ujww)", "id": "d6hq2r0"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d6i2u5j"}, {"comment": "it is real porn tho", "id": "d6i4h1e"}, {"comment": "Nah they're not actually having sex.

Just look at her MFC \"menu\"\u2014there's one guy who's given her at least 20k tokens.  Based on my Googling, the lowest price you can get for a bulk discount is $0.079/token (i.e. 7.9\u00a2/token), which works out to him paying (at least) $1580, and the model getting a cool $1000 payout ($0.05/token).  Forget porn\u2014this guy could be hiring escorts if he really wanted to.  But he feels some sort of connection with her, and feels like he's furthering their \"relationship\" by dropping cash like that.\n\n\nI don't begrudge camgirls for doing what they do.  They can make ridiculous amounts of money for being on camera for a few hours a day, and they have total independence\u2014more power to 'em.  But I can't help but feel bad for the core group of guys that fund their lifestyle.  It amounts to emotional addiction with serious financial consequences.\n\n\nI won't claim any kind of superiority to these fellas.  It's embarrassing to admit, but a few years back, I ended up buying a lighting kit off the Amazon Wishlist of the only online \"model\" I ever followed.  It was only $20, and I justified it by telling myself I would get something out of it because it would improve the quality of her content.  She dropped off the face of the planet soon after, and I immediately realized what a na\u00efve idiot I was.  Needless to say, I haven't done anything like that since.  I'm glad I was able to learn that lesson so gently, though. It taught me how easy it could be to fall into that trap, and gave me more empathy for the guys who do.\n\n\nIn addition, I think it gives a bit of insight into why you see these huge tippers who aren't receiving any specific benefit for their money.  I never would have dreamed about paying for her Snapchat or any other services\u2014then, as now, I saw the prices as highway robbery.  But a gift...it feels *good* to give people gifts, you don't expect anything in return (how convenient for the camgirl!), and it deepens the illusion that you're in a real relationship with this person.", "id": "dar8u02"}, {"comment": "I had a friend who use to pull me out to his favorite strip clubs. He would drop loud's on these women, and I don't mean from his pocket rocket. Like clock work, every Friday after he'd get paid. He'd say he was going to see his girlfriend, when they never actually met outside of the club... He eventually ended up taking a pregnant stripper in and raising her and the kid. idk, sometimes you just have to let people live their own lives and not feel bad for guys like this. There's a whole industry that is dedicated solely on the fantasy's of single lonely men. If they want to pay out the cash and it makes them feel something, isn't that better than not letting them feel at all?\nAlthough, I sorta feel the same way towards payday lenders. Charging people 30% and 40% interest on small fund loans over long terms, ridiculous. \nI digress...\nIf a camgirls wants to show her goods, that's more than I'm willing to do for some cash, more power to her... here's some bills.", "id": "darg1jo"}, {"comment": "you realize that you just described an enormous swath of sex work, right?\n\na whole lot of the \"work\" portion of sex work is emotional, not physical, labor, as many men tend to get emotionally attached to the people they pay to get sex stuff from (look no further than our esteemed president-elect for proof)\n\nI would never blame sex workers for squeezing every dime they can out of these kinds of guys, who are, after all, getting precisely what they are paying for: sex and attention", "id": "darecvf"}, {"comment": "Oh, absolutely\u2014we needn't look further than the old trope of men attempting to \"rescue\" prostitutes they become attached to.  It just seems somehow sadder to me given the inherent distance of cyberspace.  At least when a guy pays for a lapdance or an escort, there's a tangible service being bought and real physical contact (maybe he'll get a nice oxytocin hit), although the emotional connection is just as phony.  With a camgirl, it's exclusively limited to those few empty words streamed over the internet.  Also, the more money you spend, the more/higher quality physical sex work you can buy, whereas spending $10 or $1000 dollars on camgirls barely changes your experience beyond pure perception.\n\nNow, seeing as I'm not and have never been a john, I can't really say whether the former really fills the void of loneliness any more than the latter, but it *seems* better.  Maybe it's purely cultural conditioning, and the next generation will see them as equal.\n\nAgain, I'd like to reiterate that I feel no ill will toward sex workers.  They're leveraging their skills and resources to get by, just like the rest of us.  In the same way, I can see no problem with someone running a casino while still feeling bad for the gambling addicts.

He knows his wife is always getting horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn\u2019t much like the idea of her having sex with someone else.\n\nSo he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation to the old man.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don\u2019t know of anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except a\u201d said the old man, and then he stopped.\n\n\u201cExcept what?\u201d asked the businessman.\n\n\u201cNothing, it's nothing,\u201d said the old man.\n\n\u201cPlease, tell me! I need something!\u201d protested the businessman.\u201cWell, sir, I don\u2019t usually mention this, but there is the \u2018Voodoo Dildo,\u2019\u201d the old man said.\n\n\u201cThe Voodoo Dildo?\u201d the businessman asked.\n\nThe old man reached under the counter, and pulled out a beautifully ornate old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, \u201cBig fucking deal. It looks like any other dildo in this shop!\u201d\n\nThe old man said, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen what it\u2019ll do yet.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a door and said \u201cVoodoo Dildo, the door.\u201d\n\nThe Voodoo Dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, \u201cVoodoo Dildo, box!\u201d\n\nThe voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.\n\nThe businessman said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d\n\nThe guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, \u201cVoodoo dildo, my pussy.\u201d\n\nHe left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.\n\nAfter he\u2019d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the Voodoo Dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said \u201cVoodoo dildo, my pussy!\u201d The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced before.\n\nAfter four orgasms, she decided she\u2019d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she\u2019d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she hastily cried, \"The Voodoo Dildo! stuck in my pussy, can't get it out!! Ahhhhh! Need..To..Get..It..OUT!! H-h-help M-m-me!!!\"\n\nThe officer looked at her incredulously for a second, and then said, \u201cYeah, right.

I came over for dinner once and went into her room. She was teasing me with her door open. Worried that her parents would catch us as they were very strict, I told her I'd wait outside. She pulled me into her walk in closet, pulled down her jeans and pulled out her vibrator, immediately started masturbating with it without turning it on. At this point I couldn't help myself anymore so I started kissing her. The vibrator was still inside her so I took her hands with one hand and held them to the wall over her head and reached down with my free hand and turned the thing on. There was just a very low hum coming from between her legs and immediately her legs buckled. I held her up and before she could pull it out we heard her moms voice coming towards us so I pulled up her underwear and jeans and she buttoned them. We ran out of the closet and sat on the bed as her mom walked in the room. She told us it was time to eat and waited for us to follow her. Now my girlfriend had a very fair complexion so her cheeks were bright pink as it was. We nervously walked with her mom to the dinner table where her dad was waiting for us. The second she sat down on a harder surface, the vibrator (still on) pushed into her and she let out the hottest gasp. I immediately faked a coughing fit to distract her parents and she excused herself to go use the bathroom, finally pulling the thing out.

He knows his wife is always getting horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn\u2019t much like the idea of her having sex with someone else.\n\nSo he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation to the old man.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don\u2019t know of anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except a\u201d said the old man, and then he stopped.\n\n\u201cExcept what?\u201d asked the businessman.\n\n\u201cNothing, it's nothing,\u201d said the old man.\n\n\u201cPlease, tell me! I need something!\u201d protested the businessman.\u201cWell, sir, I don\u2019t usually mention this, but there is the \u2018Voodoo Dildo,\u2019\u201d the old man said.\n\n\u201cThe Voodoo Dildo?\u201d the businessman asked.\n\nThe old man reached under the counter, and pulled out a beautifully ornate old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, \u201cBig fucking deal. It looks like any other dildo in this shop!\u201d\n\nThe old man said, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen what it\u2019ll do yet.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a door and said \u201cVoodoo Dildo, the door.\u201d\n\nThe Voodoo Dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, \u201cVoodoo Dildo, box!\u201d\n\nThe voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.\n\nThe businessman said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d\n\nThe guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, \u201cVoodoo dildo, my pussy.\u201d\n\nHe left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.\n\nAfter he\u2019d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the Voodoo Dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said \u201cVoodoo dildo, my pussy!\u201d The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced before.\n\nAfter four orgasms, she decided she\u2019d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she\u2019d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she hastily cried, \"The Voodoo Dildo! stuck in my pussy, can't get it out!! Ahhhhh! Need..To..Get..It..OUT!! H-h-help M-m-me!!!\"\n\nThe officer looked at her incredulously for a second, and then said, \u201cYeah, right.

I came over for dinner once and went into her room. She was teasing me with her door open. Worried that her parents would catch us as they were very strict, I told her I'd wait outside. She pulled me into her walk in closet, pulled down her jeans and pulled out her vibrator, immediately started masturbating with it without turning it on. At this point I couldn't help myself anymore so I started kissing her. The vibrator was still inside her so I took her hands with one hand and held them to the wall over her head and reached down with my free hand and turned the thing on. There was just a very low hum coming from between her legs and immediately her legs buckled. I held her up and before she could pull it out we heard her moms voice coming towards us so I pulled up her underwear and jeans and she buttoned them. We ran out of the closet and sat on the bed as her mom walked in the room. She told us it was time to eat and waited for us to follow her. Now my girlfriend had a very fair complexion so her cheeks were bright pink as it was. We nervously walked with her mom to the dinner table where her dad was waiting for us. The second she sat down on a harder surface, the vibrator (still on) pushed into her and she let out the hottest gasp. I immediately faked a coughing fit to distract her parents and she excused herself to go use the bathroom, finally pulling the thing out. Needless to say when we left to the movies after dinner I had a great time and we didn't make the movie.\n\nI miss that girl.", "id": "cysw4ax"}, {"comment": "r/gonewildstories\n", "id": "cyud4y3"}, {"comment": "That was a super hot story.", "id": "cyyg6o2"}], [{"comment": "Anyone have the video?", "id": "cysmn0e"}, {"comment": "agreed.
