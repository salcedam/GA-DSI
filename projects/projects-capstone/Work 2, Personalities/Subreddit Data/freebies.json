We were kinda loud about it so other customers would hear and at times they joined in with clapping and cheers. We never turned a kid down, even if their coupon had expired. Seeing the kids smile and be so happy really made it much easier getting through a shift of making pizzas for drunk assholes. It was infuriating as hell seeing a grown up use the coupons the kids had earned for themselves. We also had kids night once a week and provided books from the local library for them to read while waiting for their food and gave them goodie bags with stickers, pencils, peppermints and  anything else we could find. We had some total dick and his adorable 5-6 yr old daughter in on a family night and the place was empty except for them so it was quiet. You could hear him yelling at her, threatening to beat her ass if she opened her mouth and shit like that. We ended up donating a quarter each and telling the little girl it was a special gift just for her and asked if we could help her at the video games.

We were kinda loud about it so other customers would hear and at times they joined in with clapping and cheers. We never turned a kid down, even if their coupon had expired. Seeing the kids smile and be so happy really made it much easier getting through a shift of making pizzas for drunk assholes. It was infuriating as hell seeing a grown up use the coupons the kids had earned for themselves. We also had kids night once a week and provided books from the local library for them to read while waiting for their food and gave them goodie bags with stickers, pencils, peppermints and  anything else we could find. We had some total dick and his adorable 5-6 yr old daughter in on a family night and the place was empty except for them so it was quiet. You could hear him yelling at her, threatening to beat her ass if she opened her mouth and shit like that. We ended up donating a quarter each and telling the little girl it was a special gift just for her and asked if we could help her at the video games. The guy looked so fucking mad but he's like fuck it, take her. We played a few games and she got a sticker from a vending machine and seemed so happy, until she had to go back to her dad. \n\nDang, I didn't mean to get all chatty. Book-It's are awesome.

Once I had someone tell me when I called for something else that my family plan I was on from 2007 was no longer available and they had a cheaper plan.

Due to the the militia portion of the second amendment, the ACLU interpretation was that of a collective right not an individual right as was Chief Justice Burger's larger point. Now, when Scalia and four other justices decided to ignore stare decisis and 70 years of standing precedent in *Heller*, that has caused an internal review of the position.\n\n>ACLU POSITION\n\n>Given the reference to \"a well regulated Militia\" and \"the security of a free State,\" the ACLU has long taken the position that the Second Amendment protects a collective right rather than an individual right. \n\n>For seven decades, the Supreme Court's 1939 decision in United States v. Miller was widely understood to have endorsed that view. This position is currently under review and is being updated by the ACLU National Board in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in D.C. v. Heller in 2008.\n\n>In striking down Washington D.C.'s handgun ban by a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court's decision in D.C. v. Heller held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms, whether or not associated with a state militia. The ACLU disagrees with the Supreme Court's conclusion about the nature of the right protected by the Second Amendment. However, particular federal or state laws on licensing, registration, prohibition, or other regulation of the manufacture, shipment, sale, purchase or possession of guns may raise civil liberties questions.\n\n>ANALYSIS \n\n>Although ACLU policy cites the Supreme Court's decision in U.S. v. Miller as support for our position on the Second Amendment, our policy was never dependent on Miller. Rather, like all ACLU policies, it reflects the ACLU's own understanding of the Constitution and civil liberties.\n\n>Heller takes a different approach than the ACLU has advocated. At the same time, it leaves many unresolved questions, including what firearms are protected by the Second Amendment, what regulations (short of an outright ban) may be upheld, and how that determination will be made.\n\n>Those questions will, presumably, be answered over time\n\nLaw is an extremely complicated and nuanced discipline.

If you click OP's link you can see the coupon is clearly made by (for) Petsmart, not T-Mobile, and does not employ the normal method of obtaining the coupon that other T-Mobile actually-exclusive things to.\n\nT-Mobile knew this was not exclusive because they knew it was a one-size-fits-all coupon that anyone can use, because they do all their other T-Mobile Tuesday codes differently. They were simply handing out the same coupon to all their customers. Just because Petsmart only gave the info to T-Mobile doesn't mean it was exclusive since everyone can use it.

Your logic is that cause Petsmart decided to take an easy route for their staff and make a generic bardcode, which was only accessible to T-mobile customers at first (as there were no other official links to that page).

It was just a count down timer you had to press. \n\nT-mobile itself doesn't make the codes or deals, their partners do. So while some use codes, like Wendy's, or count downs, Subway, Petsmart decided on just a generic bardcode. \n\nWas that a bad idea? Yes. \n\nDoes this now make it \"non-exclusive\"? No it doesn't. \n\nPetsmart made this whole deal into an honor system, which they now learned was a bad idea.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "d77sm4q"}, {"comment": "I think you were trying to make this \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af!  \n  Type it like this \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\_/\u00af  \n  ^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot, ^^visit ^^/r/ArmFixerBot ^^for ^^more ^^info!", "id": "d77sm84"}, {"comment": "Whoa", "id": "d77sqhg"}, {"comment": "Are they gonna fight?", "id": "d77wa6a"}, {"comment": "I sure hope so", "id": "d77wg2e"}, {"comment": "\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "id": "d782cze"}, {"comment": "No u", "id": "d78n3b6"}, {"comment": "Yeah...

It's at:  **https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kentuckyhome/225826846?token=a53225ed**\n\nWe had the first 25 lids come in this week from the first production line test.  Turned out pretty great!  We have a few leaking issues to solve with how the seal adheres to the metal, but once we solve that problem we'll be ready to make the first 500 units, which will get sent out to everyone that signed up from the original post.\n\nWe have a a new GIF showing the function of the lid, which turned out pretty well.  If everything stays on track we should have the first 500 in production for you all by the end of this month.\n\nThank you again to everyone in the group for all the awesome feedback / criticism and suggestions so far - much appreciated!\n\nDavid & Jim\n\n", "id": "daz0wn1"}], [{"comment": "I've seen this idea years ago.

One of my professors pointed out the dangers in thinking that way - considering how many animals need homes is one argument, but also: do poor people not deserve the happiness and health that an animal can bring? In times of suffering, sometimes it is your animal companions that are the only things keeping you going. We value that human-animal bond, and while ideally everyone would be able to afford the very best care for their animals, that is not the only thing we should consider. If the animal can have a happy life in a poor home, that is much better than a sad life in a rich but abusive home, or an ignored life in a rich home. \n\n\nI guess you have to consider, in a similar situation: would you only allow a well-to-do family to have children? Or does any loving family deserve that privilege? I feel like the answer is not denying people the right to these two types of happiness, but rather finding ways to make pets and children more affordable, more accessible (in terms of resources). \n", "id": "dai0n6k"}, {"comment": "Wow I never thought about it like that.
