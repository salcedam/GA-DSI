while i was in the store.* i'm saying that they caught me in there, while the store was closed, and arrested me on the spot both times. \n\ncops kept begging me to make a statement admitting guilt. i told them to fuck off. they wouldn't give me a blanket. one of them said that if i didn't make a statement, he'd take my pants and shoes as evidence. so i made a long drawn out statement that pretty much meant nothing. he was pissed, but by that time, i was able to make bail. \n\nthat month was hell. the first arrest was no big deal, i didn't have much of a record. but after the second arrest happened so quickly, i was almost certain i'd be facing jail time. finally, one month after my second arrest, i went to court for my first court date on the first arrest. the first charge was dismissed. i was stoked. now my second arrest was just like a first offense, and i knew i'd be facing probation at worst. then the second court date came, and that one was dismissed too. i was floored.\n\nmy lawyer told me i must have a horseshoe up my ass when that second case was dismissed. funny enough, he whispered it while the judge was still talking in the second case. everyone was smiling, especially the judge. it was weird as hell. \n\nthe truth is though, it wasn't luck. the cops didn't want to take evidence and build a case. they just wanted me to do their job for them, and write a statement admitting guilt. i could see their frustration the whole time i was at the station (or whatever it is, it wasn't connected to the police station and it only had about 4 cells). they just... felt like talking shit to me and joking with each other meant more than doing what they were supposed to, which was prove that i broke into stores while they were closed in order to rob them.\n\nanyway i got a little off point there. and in this situation with these robbers, who knows if it was the cops being incompetent. it was prolly the operators to be honest. i guess my point is that people are really lazy / careless, and shit like this happens all the time. it happens at all levels, even most courts are just revolving doors. people are getting arrested so frequently, for so

But calling a judge a motherfucker should not be a crime, even if it is done in court, especially any sentance longer than a few hours or days.\n\n The fact the we Americans screech freedom at eachother, but are ok with people losing a year of their life for shit talking someone with power, is so hypocritical it hurts my mind. I should, and do, show respect to judiciaries because they deserve it, not because have to show it or risk punishment.

The impact snaps the head which literally rattles the brain against the skull.  I've seen people get knocked out via open hand slap.

I would argue that's probably a fairly high percentage, but it's almost certainly non-zero.

Roofy?", "id": "d269he0"}, {"comment": "date rape drug", "id": "d269knb"}, {"comment": "http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/roofy\n\n>Flunitrazepam, said to be the most widely prescribed sedative and hypnotic in Europe, although it is not licensed for sale in the U.S., has been the subject of increasing concern as illegal distribution and abuse of the drug have spread from southern U.S. states to other parts of this country. Abuse is particularly prevalent among high school and college youth. Used alone, flunitrazepam induces mild euphoria and sedation. It is often taken with other agents, for example to enhance a heroin high or to ease the experience of coming down from a cocaine or crack high. Flunitrazepam and alcohol have a synergistic effect, producing disinhibition and amnesia when taken together. For this reason the drug may be surreptitiously added to alcoholic drinks to facilitate date rape. Part of the popularity of the drug arises from its low cost and the availability of legally manufactured pure tablets. Flunitrazepam is marketed by Hoffman-La Roche under the brand name Rohypnol. Street names include \"circles,\" \"Mexican Valium,\" \"la rocha,\" \"R2,\" \"rib,\" \"roaches,\" \"roachies,\" \"Roche,\" \"roofenol,\" \"roofies,\" \"rope,\" \"rophies,\" and \"ruffies.\" Being under the influence of the drug is referred to as being \"roached out.\" The effects of flunitrazepam begin within 30 minutes after ingestion, peak within 2 hours, and may persist for 8 hours or more. Adverse effects include drowsiness, confusion, amnesia, paradoxic excitement or aggressiveness, visual disturbances, hypotension, gastrointestinal upset, and urinary retention. Lethal overdose is uncommon. Continued use results in physical dependence. Withdrawal symptoms range from headache, muscle pain, restlessness, and confusion to loss of identity, hallucinations, delirium, convulsions, and cardiovascular collapse. Withdrawal seizures can occur a week or more after cessation of use. Phenobarbital has been used to ease medically supervised withdrawal. Tablets of Rohypnol currently produced by Hoffman-LaRoche dissolve slowly in beverages and release a bright blue color so as to render covert administration less feasible.", "id": "d269rcz"}, {"comment": "I'm sorry I should have been a bit clearer.

My tiny little condo my mom worked her ass off to afford was the hangout spot for my friends. Not the house with the trampoline on the lake, or the one with extra BMX bikes, or the kid with the sweet movie theater. A lot of it was because of my mom. She was always willing to have some one over for dinner or to help with our home work. All of the maids and nannies etc these kids had didn't do that. It wasn't their job. \n\nOne of my good friends stayed over for almost 2 weeks sharing my tiny room and my bunk bed because his mom planned a trip, forgot to tell her divorced husband and just assumed he was going to be around, but he was in the middle of selling a company to a Japanese entity and had to be in Japan for nearly a month with his exec team. So she called my mom, but not to ask her if this kid could stay just to make sure he got picked up from a day trip we were on. Only after figuring out all of the above (relayed to my mom from the airport while boarding announcements are going on) did it become clear this kid was going to need to stay with us. \n\nSo TL;dr I dunno what happened in this kids life but some times there's too much privilege and not much else.

You'll get thrown into jail pretty quick.\n\nBut he was put on parole, I doubt he even got much jail time, if any.  Then he violated that parole by punching a police officer in the face.

There are some other areas of the world that have unarmed, soft hand techniques as a practise and while it has its benefits, it has some very serious problems. It all comes down to what type of applicants your requirements invite. \n\nThat, to me, is the biggest law enforcement issue. Having the bar set too low. I'm from Canada. Our LE requirement is better than most, but not by a ton and its no where near perfect. The LE bar HAS to be raised. Almost every internal issue law enforcement faces in today's age is a product of a low standard of employment requirement (in my opinion).\n\n Sure there are some officers who come out and do great. There are some people who start with LITERALLY the most noble goals and intentions. But its simply not enough. Just wanting to help people or to do good does not sufficiently prepare you for the job. A totally normal, well adjusted person can work, be put into a critical situation and fall the fuck apart, get scared and unlawfully take someone's life. It's about setting a system where these sorts of people are not accepted. It's not for everyone. \n\nThere is a continuum LE officers are supposed to use. In some places the continuum is slightly different, the core concept remains the same. You have to be changing your levels of force to meet the threat you oppose.

It just seems strange that stopping the action of an armed, non-compliant individual who is behaving erratically, and has already attacked innocent people with bladed weapons does not meet your criteria.\n\nIn this case, these security guards did an outstanding job.  I am absolutely in awe of their actions, believe they are superlatively brave, went absolutely beyond what one could reasonably expect them to do in such a situation, and are truly heroes.  In addition to all of these things, these men are *profoundly lucky*.  There were 1,000 ways this approach could have gone wrong, and none of them happened here.  I am tremendously grateful that everything worked out in this case, but serious injury to the security guards was very likely using this strategy.\n\nJust because this approach worked in this case, doesn't mean that this is the appropriate tactic to used in similar cases.

Is it not courageous enough that police officers are tasked with responding to situations where individuals armed with deadly weapons are attacking other people with the duty and responsibility to take control of the situation?  Why must they do so without use of proper tools/tactics?  I understand that there is an inherent value in preserving human life, but quite frankly, preserving the lives of the responding officers, and the innocent people involved in the situation is significantly more important than preserving the life of the aggressor.  Why?  Because they are not the ones who get to decide whether or not everyone gets to go home that day.  All the aggressor has to is drop their weapon, place their hands in the air, and follow verbal commands.  Nobody dies, it's as simple as that.  If they refuse to do so, and continue to present a serious threat to the safety and survival of the people around them who did nothing to create the situation--they risk losing their lives.

", "id": "cya9ro9"}, {"comment": "The problem with using a taser is that they are not nearly as reliable as many people assume them to be.  If both prongs of the device make good contact when the device is deployed it will create an effect called \"neuro muscular incapacitation\" (NMI).  NMI is the muscular lockout that you witness when an individual is successfully tased that causes them to fall down and lose control over their motor functions -- it is incredibly effective.  However, if just one of the prongs does not make good contact with the skin (e.g. if it hits a phone, or a wallet, or a belt/belt buckle, or the subject is wearing thick clothing, etc.) the taser will have absolutely no effect whatsoever.  Reloading the cartridge and attempting a second shot takes approximately 2-3 seconds for a well trained user (and again will not guarantee a successful deployment).  Holstering a taser and drawing a firearm also takes approximately this amount of time.  \n\nI don't know if you are familiar with the Tueller Drill (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tueller_Drill), but it was an experiment conducted to determine how quickly an individual armed with a knife could cover a distance of 21 feet and attack a target.  It was determined that this distance can be closed in an average of 1.5 seconds.  Which means that if you are within that range facing an attacker armed with a bladed instrument you have less than 1.5 seconds to stop the action (not just shoot them, they need to be incapacitated--it does not matter if you shoot and even mortally wound your attacker if they manage to use momentum to carry out the rest of their attack, and stab you in the neck) should they chose to attack you.\n\nTasers, depending on which cartridge is used, have either a 15 ft. or 25 ft. range.  When you take all of these facts into account it is incredibly dangerous and tactically foolish to use a taser against an attacker armed with bladed weapons.  If you choose to use a taser you have one shot that *needs* to be effective, or you face a high likelihood of receiving great bodily harm or being killed.  You don't get to reload and you don't get the opportunity to transition to a different weapons system if you miss.  Instead, you get stabbed.\n\nNow, if there are multiple officers on the scene, one officer could attempt to deploy his taser if he had lethal cover from another officer.  For an individual officer, though, using a taser in this scenario is too risky.\n\nAs far as your concern for missing shots, that is where weapons proficiency comes in.  Officers should train, train, train with their weapons to ensure that they can reliably hit a target center body mass from contact ranges (which are generally within 3 yards) in high stress situations.\n\nThe security officer in this video is tremendously brave, but is also tremendously fortunate.  If you are attempting to minimize the risk of injury to responding officers, and the public, his approach was far from ideal from a tactical standpoint.", "id": "cyab2ov"}, {"comment": "Thank you for your opinion.

In the ED, most of the staff would jump in on fights as soon as they started.  Nurses, techs, male female it didn't matter.  We had some serious guys in there.  One of the nurses was a third something or other black belt in Ju Jitzu(pretty sure I mispelled that).  I used to tell people that it didn't matter if they could beat me in a fight, because I had ten friends within shouting distance and we'd pour on people till you couldn't move.\n\nGod I loved the hospital.

I was born and raised in Beijing, currently residing in New York for college, and I hope I can clear up some things regarding the background of this video.\n\nLet me talk about Chinese tourists. There is absolutely no denying that there are atrocious Chinese tourists out there. I volunteered at a tourist site in China during peak tourism dates (first week of September, national holiday), and it was fucking chaotic. People are pushing each other around to get in line, littering everywhere, absolute nightmare. I'm ashamed that my countrymen behave like this, but in our defense, there's something that you need to understand.\n\nChina was only very recently lifted out of poverty. My parents' generation barely missed WWII, then they had to go through the Civil War and the Cultural Revolution, where there were fucking famines. My dad told me cooking oil was a luxury when he was growing up, as was meat. Lamb was beyond their imagination. Suddenly, twenty or thirty years later, people are moving into cities, buying houses and cars, and earning enough money for TOURISM. A lot of these people are from rural China, where education is still working their way into the younger generation. These people are not yet *educated* in how to behave in the Western world. I say, give it a generation or two, and the notorious \"Chinese tourists\" will be less prevalent.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to offer my perspective on these issues.", "id": "d1wuhm5"}, {"comment": "Wait 50 years for Chinese tourists to finally stop vandalising ancient landmarks \n\nMeanwhile the ancient landmarks get destroyed ", "id": "d1x9crx"}, {"comment": "\"I'm ignorant\" hasn't ever been a valid excuse for atrocities, I don't know why we'd start being cool with it now.

There's some gray area there - for example, if maybe someone didn't tip in a US restaurant a number of this group would say, well, they don't realize tipping is common, so that's understandable. But that same person, seeing a Chinese tourist drop trou and shit in the street, might be less interested in the historical reasons this person thinks it's fine to take a dump on the sidewalk and more interested in just making them stop.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is your contribution is useful, but you should understand that there's a lot of people - and probably this is more prevalent in America, where individualism, perceived self-reliance and responsibility for oneself is considered so important - who are entirely unswayed by your comments.\n\nTheir answer (and, yeah, mine) would be: At some point we have to draw a line and say on THAT side is where you can shit in the street and shove people aside to get to the front of a line just because you want to, and on THIS side we don't do that shit, so wherever you come from either deal with being in this world or just go fuck off.

Let me try to compare Beijing-ers and New Yorkers, since these are the two cities I'm most familiar with.\n\nBoth are large, densely populated cities and critical to the respective country's economy and culture. One major similarity I've found between the two is that everyone minds their own business. There's a feeling of isolation when you walk the streets.\n\nBoth cities have an extensive subway system. The NYC subway during rush hour is very crowded and people bump into each other all the time, but every time a train pulls in, it's generally pretty orderly. People step off, then people step on. That's kind of the unspoken rule, and people in NYC follow it well.\n\nThe Beijing subway during rush hour is truly a sight to behold. Trains and platforms are packed to the brim, and I kid you not, the gap between two trains is only 15 seconds apart (I actually timed it once). It's far less orderly than NYC as you imagine, and people on the platform try to shove in before people leave the train. Here's the thing, there are signs posted all over the platforms reminding people to be orderly, and workers are hired to use megaphones to maintain order. Every time a train pulls into the station, the workers yell \"\u5148\u4e0b\u540e\u4e0a,\" which roughly translate into \"let people leave first before boarding.\" The government is trying hard to train people to be orderly, and since the 2008 Olympics when the subway system got an overhaul, I would say things are getting better.\n\nNot sure if this answers your question, hope it helps.", "id": "d1xkgr9"}, {"comment": "Consider how what Chinese culture was like before the Revolution.

Sure somebody came along, somebody picked it up, somebody threw it in the trash can, but for the few moments where that sat on the ground and the law was violated in my neighborhood.\n\nWhat about the time when im on the sidewalk and I watch a guy cross the street and hes not even within the lines? Hes publically jaywalking. There was a police officer standing right there, he didn't do anything. He didn't do anything. We have chaos, we have anarchy at times in West Linn.\n\nYou know, you look at me and, there were years when my father didn't even make a hundred grand, or barely made a hundred. And sure we had a maid, but she only came twice a week. What do you think happened on the other five days? You think those dishes washed themselves? You think those clothes got themselves in the hamper?\n\nMy neighbors were twins. They got a Mercedes for their birthday, but just one. They had to share that car. They had to share that car. Who gets to drive today? I had to see these things. You ask me about growing up like that, you think im scared?

Again, please keep in mind, the \"innocent explanation\" you provide must be so compelling that it is not only recognized as a scant possibility, but would actually lead someone to believe that it was unreasonable for the defendant to assume that the man who pulled away the grasp a uniformed police and was being chased while being directed to stop was not actively evading law enforcement officers.\n\nI can guarantee that you cannot find a single real life example of an individual filing and winning a lawsuit of this nature.

He can go all out offense and practically any punch he lands is game over for Ronda, her striking defense is nowhere near the level of a pro boxer, much less a champion boxer.\n\nHer only hope would be to rush the takedown, and hope Floyd hasn't taken an afternoon to develop a half-decent sprawl.  She won't have the strength to control the arm and get an armbar on him from the guard or the strength or weight to tire him out and wait for him to post up with his arm and present a good target.  He's also going to have the reach to drop bombs on her head from the guard anyway which gives her probably about 5 seconds to win from the guard or lose.

At all. Also, if that's a punch to you, I hope you never fight anyone. You don't punch someone in the back while you're facing their front.

It's hard to see what the officer who took down the suspect is doing, so I can't reasonably comment on that, but as you can see that the suspect is still resisting and another officer is repeatedly telling him to put his hands behind his back, I'd guess it has something to do with trying to control his hands. \n\n>Sorry man, your answer is such sycophantic crap I have a hard time understanding how \"refusing to cooperate with police\" should be treated with beat downs.\n\nWhen you break multiple laws, refuse to cooperate with police and then physically resist arrest, you're probably going to get a little battered in the process of being detained, and it's your own damned fault.

Around 1:00 it looks like he's trying to do [Seoi Otoshi](http://gradera.nu/Image/Orange%20b%C3%A4lte/seoi_otoshi_stilla.GIF) but he's gripping around the neck again and standing perpendicular to him, though considering his leg position it's probably lucky he didn't pull it off since he might have dislocated his knee cap if he didn't twist it to face down at the last moment. The Seoi Otoshi would have been good with the height difference if he knew how to do it well. \n\nMain reason for failures though is he can't use the other guys momentum correctly; he's not using it to throw the guy and just trying to use his own strength, so he's not taking his balance correctly during the technique. Maybe a result of him being used to doing the techniques in a judo style environment and not a jiu-jitsu one where he's getting punches thrown at him and is learning to use those to power the techniques?\n\nSomeone with more knowledge of throws might have a better idea though, to me it just looks like he's someone that knows some solid basic throws like Koshi Guruma but has an idea of how to do some more fancier looking throws and is trying to use those when he could just use something more basic to get the job done.\n\nEdit: /u/killerviel seems to have identified the throws better than me, the first being Uchi Mata and the second a Koshi Guruma with some really dodgy leg work.

I've never heard someone calling a throw the cowboy before (I'm English) so I'm not completely sure which throw you were referring to in the earlier post. Knee and hips are key to a good Harai Goshi or O Goshi and he was on the completely wrong side to use them for the first throw, probably should have gone for the Uki Goshi since he kept getting into the T position anyway. And if he used his hips and turned for the Seoi Otoshi he would have got him over, he was trying to lower him instead of pulling him over his leg, but I still think he may of busted his kneecap if he did it like that.

Brutal in execution but there are at least 3 very easy counters that make it  a poor choice against an experienced adversary.\n\nI got my fastest and second ever fastest pins off of cowboy throws though, in the same night.

He was definitely not trying to do a Harai Goshi, otherwise one of his legs would be outside of the bully's. \n\n\nThe second one to me seems more like a bad Koshi-Guruma as he is grabbing on his neck, though he holds his feet waaaay too far apart for it to be even effective. Most of your strength comes from your legs and by keeping them so far apart means you're losing a lot of it.

His legs being spread is stopping it from working due to there being no pivot point though, he shouldn't need to use any strength if the positioning was correct, especially considering how bad the other guys balance was already.\n\nThanks for the corrections, it was a bit too messy to make out for sure.", "id": "cz9hyod"}, {"comment": "that should help.

I've been boxing and training guys for about fifteen years now and just a little bit of training makes a massive difference, street fight or in the ring.  You'd be shocked as to how many men have no idea how to throw a punch or even avoid one.  Unfortunately I grew up in an area where fighting was very commonplace and when I became an adult, lived in the same city where again, fights happen often.  Having a little bit of training and experience allows you to easily beat a very large portion of the male population.  I'd say a good 98%.  Throw alcohol in the mix and it's almost 100%.  I've had much bigger guys come at me or my friends and they all get whupped because they have no idea how to fight.  I try to avoid it as much as possible but it's simply unavoidable sometimes.  Seriously, I recommend that every guy, or even girl, reading this goes out and takes ten hours worth of some form of fighting training.  Any kind that actually teaches you how to punch and move and proper footwork.  No karate or anything like that. Boxing, kick boxing/muay thai, krav maga, bjj.  Something that teaches you the basics and lets you spar.  The training I do is typically for more advanced boxers, but I do a few classes a week where I teach newbies the basics of boxing.  I get so many guys that are big and act all tough and hard, but they have no idea what they're doing and would get destroyed by a knowledgeable guy half their size.

You can shoot 100 rounds through it and your hands don't hurt afterwards.  [Notable - the S&W 644 revolvers have painful recoil so I could never hit the target after a few shots.)\n\n* The gun does not jam (kawf kawf) when you most need it.  If it does jam, you can easily clear it.\n\n* It's small and light enough that you can and WILL carry it every day, and is easy and comfortable to conceal.  A larger and heavier gun may be hard to drive with, or pull your pants down, or you may simply decide it's too hard to conceal ... so you leave it at home.  (Notable - I bought a full-sized Glock and never carried it.  Too heavy, inconvenient, uncomfortable.)\n\n* It works in a predictable manner.  Magazines don't drop out accidentally, safety doesn't get knocked accidentally, sights are easy to use, magazines load and unload smoothly and don't get jammed, etc.  [Notable - I bought a DiamondBack DB380 and the magazines would not drop out when empty - I had to pull them out.]\n\n* Slide locks open when the magazine/chamber is empty (after shooting or for maintenance) ad my wife can do it as well, as well as release the slide lock.  [Notable - DiamondBack did not lock back, wife could not slide back the full-sized Glock, nor could she release it, so she would not be able to reload.]\n\n* Has enough ammo capacity that you have more than 5 rounds, carrying more ammo is easily accommodated, and you can reload quickly.\n\n* Easy to disassemble, clean, maintain, and put back together.

Most ammo will simply jam or fail to chamber, not leaving the bullet in a position where the primer could be hit.  Semi-autos are pretty precisely manufactured, and something being the wrong shape will generally not even cycle properly.\n\nThere are various .22 calibers that will fit and fire in a weapon designed for .22LR, but it's unlikely that anything bad would happen in one shot.  If you're unlucky, a .22 short round will fire and fail to escape the barrel, making the next shot a kaboom.\n\nA 12G pump shotgun will chamber a 20G (that's smaller, btw) shell without an unsurpassable level of difficulty. Not entirely impossible for it to actually go off when you pull the trigger.  Unlikely to explode your gun, but could easily result in an excess of hot gas blowing out onto your hands.  And by \"hot gas\", I mean it could be anything from a bad burn to something that blows the skin off your fingers.  It would be hard to fail to notice that you're loading a 20G into a 12G and something isn't right, though.\n\nA revolver could do it, because you put the ammo in the chamber by hand, the ammo generally has a rim on it which could keep it in place, and the hammer on some revolvers comes down with quite a lot of authority.  You'd have to be an absolute moron to not notice the ammo isn't fitting properly when you load it, but morons and guns are not exactly strangers.\n\nMost gun explosions are not from the wrong caliber of ammo, though.  Modern \"smokeless powder\" is much more powerful per volume than older stuff, but calibers that have been around for a long time were designed for the old stuff.  If you take an old gun and fire a modern \"hot\" load of ammunition, like a vintage revolver and a .38 +P load, you can kaboom the gun.  \n\nThe other common cause of kabooms is improper home loads of ammunition.  You are *supposed* to carefully inspect each piece of brass and carefully measure out the powder according to tight specifications.  If you were to, say, use a piece of brass that already had a weak spot and accidentally double-load the powder, you're going to have a bad day.\n\nFinally, you can kaboom a gun by leaving something in the barrel when you fire.

You can (not that you should mind you) shoot .380 acp in a 9mm and it's not going to blow up but it's most likely going to fail to cycle. The bullets are actually the same diameter the 380's lighter and 9mm usually heavier but in the cross over of their weight range, you can load the exact same bullet into either caliber. \n\nYou \"can\" shoot 9mm in some 40 S&W (again, not that you should) and it probably won't blow up but the case will swell and it will probably fail to cycle correctly and will likely take your gun out of commission pending a visit to the smith, this could potentially end more catastrophically since the bullet is simply too small for the bore but I've seen it done on video and in real life with only failure to eject and case swelling issues as the consequence. That and terrible accuracy since the bullet is just bouncing down the barrel.\n\nI think you can load 40 into some 9mm mags, but it would never chamber, it would just lock the slide back, like in the video.\n\nMany common calibers of handgun ammunition are actually intentionally dimensionally designed NOT to fit into guns with similar sized ammunition that would be structural incapable of handling the load.\n\nFor example the 357 mag is basically a 38 spl that has been made longer and loaded hotter. It was made longer specifically to avoid accidentally loading a 357 in a 38 handgun (potential BOOM), but you can safely load a 38 into a 357. Ditto for 44 spl and 44 mag.\n\ntldr:\n>Does it mean that they're gone well just jam or will it explode like to read in a novel.\n\nIn most common junkie robbing a store scenarios, you're talking about loading 380 in 9mm or 9mm in 40. Your most likely result is jamming.\n\nEDIT: OK did some research. Apparently you can chamber 9 luger in at least some 9x18 pistols, that sounds suicidal to me.

Yes he cried and broke down because he realized that he had to go to jail. However, even if he *doesn't* feel remorse/ resentment for what he did, my comment (insert bias here, I guess) just served to state that I understand why he was crying, and even though a lot of you thought he deserved every bit moment of life in jail (trust me I did too), I still empathized with him. Why? Because he's a human. This dude is definitely not a psychopath. I can guarantee that he is going to contemplate what he did, and he will feel sorry about it. I'm not saying that he should get out because he is sorry, but just that I think that the entire fucking case is shitty. Three families ruined (yes, think about his family. I'm sure they weren't on board with the murder and I'm sure they were appalled and at the same time upset for losing their son/ relative as well), and a dumbass wasted the rest of his life because of one stupid decision.\n\nSo yeah. Sorry to piss some of you off.

A majority of top level comments are requesting that people stop posting this shit and yet *all* of them are downvoted way past the collapse threshold, as much as -54 points. -54 points?! That's not normal for such a small thread. That's significantly more downvotes than the top comment has upvotes! Then, any replies to those buried comments which are siding with SaD are upvoted even higher! Someone is reading through buried comments, burying them deeper and upvoting anyone who agrees with them. That's a pretty concerted effort to bury critical comments and the whole thing stinks of typical hailcorporate shenanigans.\n\nThat's why I want these videos to fuck off. I'm sick of the place being used as a spam dick-rag by these fucking unoriginal pricks.

One kid was a good bit bigger than most of the rest of the class.  There wasn't anyone close to his size to spar with so the teacher asks the room in general (staring at me) if there's a dad who would be the kid's sparring partner.  Why not?  I'm a foot and a half taller than the kid and have at least a hundred pounds on him.\n\nI bowed my way onto the mat, bowed to my 12 year old opponent, and we went to work on a simple drill on how to respond to an attack from behind.  We were to take turns grabbing each other's shoulders from behind.  The counter was a sweep of the non dominate arm to tie up the attacker's arms followed by a jab of stiffened fingers to the throat.  Push your opponent back and step away, and you've created distance so you can adjust and assess what you do next.\n\nWe took turns through a few reps at slow speed.  Next thing I knew, the jab to the throat was for real.  He got me right in the Adam's apple.  Last fight I got in was at least 20 years ago so I naturally grabbed my throat and started to curl over.
