In fact the rest of is post is more taking away from his musicianship than anything else.\n\n> Hendrix merged the roles and playing styles for lead and rhythm guitar. Normally a rhythm guitarist plays exclusively chords and stays on the beat 100%, without doing anything fancy.\n\nAnyone that's ever listened to Robert Johnson or Muddy Waters knows this is just what blues guitarists do. Hendrix, who was steeped in this tradition, was just playing what he knew. Listen to Muddy Waters play [I can't be satisfied](https://youtu.be/CakqPuwFAIc) for instance, and tell me whether he's playing the rhythm or lead part.\n\n> Hendrix played his notes and chords differently.\n\nEssentially saying Hendrix played with his thumb. While true, I don't believe this contributed significantly to his musicianship, though this is admittedly debatable. You can't just start playing with your thumb and immediately unlock some secret power of playing more notes, as is suggested. There are also plenty of ways to do this without using your thumb.\n\n> He experimented tons and pioneered many techniques used to this day, particularly in his use of distortion/feedback and studio work. \n\nAgain, Jimi Hendrix is not the best example of this. Ray Davies comes to mind as a guitarist that invented a singular distorted guitar sound, and Les Paul essentially invented the electric guitar. The Beatles claim to be the first to have recorded feedback of any kind. In fact, in researching this, I learned that Jimi used essentially [off the shelf fuzz boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_\\(music\\)#1960s:_fuzz.2C_distortion.2C_and_introduction_of_commercial_devices) that everyone else around that time was also using.\n\n> Axis: Bold As Love demonstrates more chord/lead work as well as an effect called flanging, where an engineer pushed down on the running tape with his thumb to produce the whooshing sound you hear on the drums closer to the end.\n\nOkay, if the engineer did it, why are you crediting Jimi? I think a lot of this stuff should really go to both the producer and engineer. \n\nI love tracks like this and Third Rock from the Sun, but I recognize it's a collaborative effort. For comparison, take a look at the other rock albums that were released in [1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_in_music). You'd be hard pressed to find a studio engineer or producer that would rank Jimi's albums above the rest. I can go into more detail if needed.\n\n> He was just plain GOOD. Dude was living the musician's dream where he could pretty quickly pick up any song and play along, in his own way.\n\nHere it is! Why did I have to read all that to get here? This is the only reason I rate Jimi as the greatest of all time. The guy was a virtuoso. He wast the best at guitar, and that's before you take anything else into consideration. He was like Mozart. He could listen to something, play it back, and come up with a million variations and chord substitutions on the fly. He played the entirety of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band the _night_ after it dropped.

It fails to model the fluctuating price of different energy sources, and it somehow manages to neglect modelling the falling background cost of renewables. (As it is, renewables are useless until you discover a 'tech' somewhere around 2090, at which point they instantly improve.)\n\n\nTech itself doesn't naturally proliferate at all. If you discover fusion power in Japan, you then have to spend a ridiculous amount of resources creating government mandates to get every other country to research and discover fusion before you can even use it. It's essentially impossible to seriously decouple economic growth from emissions growth until about 2100 (best case scenario)  in the game, and emissions levels don't stabilize until ~2060 (best case scenario). Meanwhile in reality emission levels are no longer growing globally and economic growth is now rapidly decoupling from emissions. \n\nEDIT: Another thing that really frustrates me about FotW's simulation is that it operates on completely false assumptions about how markets work and refuses to offer any market oriented policy solutions to problems. Technology only proliferates by government mandate. Rich nations with agricultural shortages are seemingly incapable of importing food.  Economies with advanced competitive renewable energy alternatives do not transition from scarce fossil fuels unless by government mandate. Factories don't transition to oil and coal feedstock alternatives unless the government tells them to, even in the face of crippling shortages.\n\nIt's a totally broken and flawed model designed to sensationalize the challenge ahead of us with climate change.

It's one of my favourite strategy games... \n\n\nBut it is a completely and utterly broken simulation that assumes a ridiculous level of pessimism and fails to simulate essential factors. \n\n\nI love it because it's challenging, offers emergent stories, and a turn fits between my work pomodoros; but I would never reccomend using it as a predictive model of the future. \n\n\nIts technological timeline is ridiculous, it assumes that the best case scenario for technological growth is that we devolop competitive renewable energy somewhere around 2090, and that weak experimental fusion power is discovered in 2120. It fails to model the fluctuating price of different energy sources, and it somehow manages to neglect modelling the falling background cost of renewables. (As it is, renewables are useless until you discover a 'tech' somewhere around 2090, at which point they instantly improve.)\n\n\nTech itself doesn't naturally proliferate at all. If you discover fusion power in Japan, you then have to spend a ridiculous amount of resources creating government mandates to get every other country to research and discover fusion before you can even use it. It's essentially impossible to seriously decouple economic growth from emissions growth until about 2100 (best case scenario)  in the game, and emissions levels don't stabilize until ~2060 (best case scenario). Meanwhile in reality emission levels are no longer growing globally and economic growth is now rapidly decoupling from emissions. \n\nEDIT: Another thing that really frustrates me about FotW's simulation is that it operates on completely false assumptions about how markets work and refuses to offer any market oriented policy solutions to problems. Technology only proliferates by government mandate. Rich nations with agricultural shortages are seemingly incapable of importing food.  Economies with advanced competitive renewable energy alternatives do not transition from scarce fossil fuels unless by government mandate. Factories don't transition to oil and coal feedstock alternatives unless the government tells them to, even in the face of crippling shortages.\n\nIt's a totally broken and flawed model designed to sensationalize the challenge ahead of us with climate change.

My point is that globally, economic growth necessitates fossil fuel usage and that globally, that mitigates the emissions-free growth from the minority of developed nations that are attempting to decarbonize. \n\nAs well, global growth over the past two years has been extremely sluggish at best, meaning a total plateau on emissions might have much to do with stalling growth rates, even if the technology of emissions-free growth is hypothetically sound. \n\n\n", "id": "d187txh"}, {"comment": "It's true that global growth is sluggish and that in developing countries this differential is often smaller, but even that differential within emerging countries is quickly widening.

Coal use in 2014 fell from its 2013 peak by something like 3%, and 2015 was a modest improvement upon that, but at the same time exports were falling and have now fallen to near record lows worldwide. I think a degree of inertia could explain the (sluggish) Chinese growth even as emissions dipped ever so slightly. \nBut this does not I think validate the viewpoint that from here forwards Chinese growth will 1) increasingly be decoupled or 2) speed up any time soon. \n\nI'm not attacking you by disagreeing, and it'd be wonderful to be wrong. I simply don't think that it's been conclusively proven that emissions-free growth is now upon us, for three reasons. First, developed nations frequently \"offshore\" emissions via having processes done in developing nations that previously they would do themselves. This is not counted against them even though it adds to world emissions. Second, global growth rates have been falling for years, leading me to believe that energy use as a whole is down even without emissions free growth. Third, if there has been growth without emissions over the past two years, my second point would have me believe that the growth rate would not be seen as satisfactory by countries such as India, or Nigeria or Kenya, meaning fossil fuel usage will continue to be the way to get the massive energy surpluses i e rapid growths rates that they desire.

We got linked to this very interesting discussion, so just thought I'd offer some insight where I could.\n\nFirst, OP: it's great that you rate FOTW amongst your favourite strategy games. We feel very proud when we hear comments like that, thank you. It gives us reason to keep the project going.\n\nOn the other hand, as you note, there are many, many problems with the model. It is deficient or bugged in some areas, plain wrong or non-existent in others.\n\nThe sad fact is, much of what you see in the original was \"first pass\" game systems, which never got the debugging and balancing they should have; within a couple of weeks of the initial launch, much of the dev team had been laid off, as Red Redemption slowly slipped into receivership.\n\nA user by the name of Delnar_Ersike made an unofficial patch, which you can find on the Steam forums. It addresses a lot of issues, particularly the game-breaking bugs, such as over-aggressive Hubbert curves for fossil fuel peak production, and an bug in the natural disaster events which permanently impacted a region's productivity. It also gives you more feedback on what cards are likely to do (something there was a lot of arguments about back in the day).\n\nIn the meantime, we're reviving the old code base, as well as developing the core systems for the sequel product. Expect to hear more and more from us about it over the coming year.\n\nIn terms of our goals, we aim to improve upon the game in all areas. Amongst other things, we want better financial and economic modelling, more detailed demographic and atmospheric systems, and gameplay that is more accessible and replayable for users.\n\nOne thing we're definitely going to do is make development an ongoing process. An indie game simulation of all planetary activity is always going to have gaps and inaccuracies, and there will always be room for improvement. With the help of a community we've found to be diligent, insightful, and informed, we think that if we stay the course we can make something truly special, and of genuine educational benefit.", "id": "d1bszx8"}, {"comment": "Well I haven't played the game the one salient point I got from the OP's analysis is that developing parts of the world are going to continue to rely on dirty energy to develop. \n\nIf the developed world moves away from fossil fuels the market for them collapses when this happens poorer countries will increase their consumption and by consequence their emissions will increase as well. With most of the population growth occurring in the developing world, the transition for them to cleaner energy will blow right through our existing carbon budget required to avoid 2 degree Celsius warming. \n\nThat is if the developed world gave up fossil fuels overnight, which won't happen. It will take considerably more aggressive action in the developed world to avoid 2C just through our own transition away from fossil fuels and then you have other concerns as well.

I tried simply sequestering the carbon that the third world begins to emit through the use of biochar, but it's impossible to sequester more than a fraction using that method. I tried promoting renewable energy in the third world. I tried focusing on addressing the problem in the first world and simply allowing the third world to join the party.\n\nThe same thing happens everytime: I get an oil shortage, because the third world now uses oil as well, just like the first world. If I respond to that by synthesizing oil from other fossil fuels to address peak oil, or if I manage to delay the oil shortage by using electrical cars in the first world, the third world merely continues to industrialize rapidly. Keep in mind that you can't wean the third world off oil until they're developed enough to transition from combustion engines to the inevitably more expensive electrical cars. This starts to push me over critical limits (first 2.5 degree, then 3 degree, andsoforth). I now have to choose one of two options: Allow the positive feedback loops to kick in, or start implementing aerosol control to prevent a further temperature rise.\n\nIf I allow the positive feedback loops to kick in, wildfires end up destroying the forests in Russia, throwing that carbon into the air. Eventually I end up losing the Amazon rainforest too. If I don't allow the positive feedback loops to kick in, I eventually find myself faced with fossil fuel shortages. This causes me to become forced to cut down on my expenses. Thus I end up having to stop my progress on decarbonizing the economy, stop the expenses needed to prevent nuclear proliferation and stabilize nations threatened by instability, or worst of all, stop spending money on my aerosol control program and watch temperatures go through the roof within a period of five or ten years.

The motivation for creating a cultural image is of course sales. There's nothing wrong with that, and it's the crux of most \"pull\" marketing. (The development of Santa as a Christmas image, cigarettes as a masculine rather than feminine product, the \"two months salary\" rule for engagement rings, diamonds for engagement rings in the first place, \"Coke Classic\" as an affirmation of traditional America, and \"energy\" drinks as a symbol of youth and rebellion are common examples in other markets.) Ralph is saying the \"bro\" view of twitch FPS players and the \"casual\" view of puzzle players are largely social constructs created by marketing themes, whereas people didn't naturally associate those views of consumers with the products until marketing galvanized those views. Once those themes are cemented for a product, users emulate the theme more than they would naturally; it's effectively creating a \"modal self\" for the product users.  \n\nIt doesn't mean that every pull marketing effort is going to be successful, and especially doesn't mean that the brand identity will remain commercially viable over time.

Every Reddit comment or post blasting a company's products seems to equate to a hundred thousand units sold, and every pledge to \"finally\" avoid preordering appears to be raging against the inevitable tide.)

According to Frederic Jameson, modernism and postmodernism are cultural formations which accompany particular stages of capitalism. Jameson outlines three primary phases of capitalism which dictate particular cultural practices (including what kind of art and literature is produced). The first is market capitalism, which occurred in the eighteenth through the late nineteenth centuries in Western Europe, England, and the United States (and all their spheres of influence). This first phase is associated with particular technological developments, namely, the steam-driven motor, and with a particular kind of aesthetics, namely, realism. The second phase occurred from the late nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth century (about WWII); this phase, monopoly capitalism, is associated with electric and internal combustion motors, and with modernism. The third, the phase we're in now, is multinational or consumer capitalism (with the emphasis placed on marketing, selling, and consuming commodities, not on producing them), associated with nuclear and electronic technologies, and correlated with postmodernism.\n\n\nI find this interesting in relation to the way the guy explained the evolution of video games. It seems as though the video games that are popular now are a reflection of the postmodern/marketing oriented world that we live in. Morality, story, overall narrative, those become secondary as gamers want to place themselves in the shoes of the character and experience ridiculous things for the sake of being ridiculous. Look at extremely popular games like Far Cry or GTA V. The stories are somewhat tacked on, the real game is just going to a cool place, and doing unrealistic insane things that you would never be able to do in real life for 1,000's of reasons. These actions would be immensely immoral in real life, but not in a video game of course because that world doesn't matter. Everything just exists for the experience that you get from it in that moment, and the games are marketed in this way. Huge guns, girls, exotic places, fancy cars, etc all are placed just because they're the most extreme things that you can experience in a no-consequence environment.

While there are games that have alternates to a matchmaking system it's impractical on a large scale with a ranked ladder. I don't entirely disagree that anonymity and the expectation that you won't play with the same people twice causes more brash behavior.

Especially if you have 4 teammates spectating the one living member of the team. In this case the 4 who have no real involvement mechanically don't need to worry about focusing. Yet far more often than not I hear kind words said when that last person fails to clutch the round.

Riot is pretty hands on. Yet I find the CSGO community infinitely better.\n\n>A game where sportsmanship has been made to be a standard cultural element will have less misbehavior. \n\nThis is hard to gauge, because I feel like almost all competitive games have an element of sportsmanship to some degree present. Whether that be in how the professional organizations conduct themselves, or the policies they have on saying something like \"GGEZ\" in chat at the end of a game. Maybe a game like Chess is a better representative of this idea as the community is generally more mature, but I couldn't say that definitively as I'm not into competitive chess.\n\n>Scale is a tremendous factor (it changes everything about the dynamics of interaction, persistence, and anonymity).\n\nAs is becoming a common theme, I don't entirely disagree. These things you're listing are all factors that *could* cause a toxic userbase, but doesn't have to, and the overabundance or lack of them do not damn a game from the get-go. Scale is a pretty unavoidable issue, but again it doesn't single-handedly determine anything.\n\nI'm not sure if you're familiar with CSGO, but I think you'll find the competitive mode in this game has a fairly good community. Far more good experiences than bad, and that's an opinion myself, my friends, and those I've talked to who play all seem to share for the most part. The game goes against almost every single point you've made, though. If what you're saying was undeniable fact then League of Legends should be the beacon of hope and CSGO should be the cesspool.

It didn't mean that they all acted out -- few did -- but remarkably simple tricks worked to reduce the incidence of bad behavior.

Or the fact that voice chat systems tend to have more abusive language? It that unmoderated systems in general tend to have more abusive language when they reach large scales?

Unmoderated forums of *all* sorts tend to go bad, especially if they get big. There's a reason that unmoderated forums are so scarce, and why the large ones that do exist tend to be regarded as cesspools. Lord of the Flies is usually invoked right around here. Scale is a huge determinant here, btw; small unmoderated communities can do quite well, as peer pressure typically serves to keep them civil.\n\nThis so universally accepted as a best practice I don't even know where to point you. For online communities, perhaps the work of Amy Jo Kim or Randy Farmer, perhaps. Or *Building Successful Online Communities: Evidence-Based Social Design* if you are more interested in scholarly stuff.\n\nFrom a business POV, it's well-discussed that communities experience participant loss when lack of moderation leads to bad behavior. They also experience lower intent to participate. One paper on this can be found at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00313.x/pdf but it's basically common knowledge. I mean, it's even in the Dummies book on community management: https://books.google.com/books?id=m8dNW9ql1WEC&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=unmoderated+online+communities&source=bl&ots=jYdzHnsSWq&sig=gt-C8r-fSReogEOmh5UKKR966dg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-nZG5geXJAhUI62MKHQ78BN0Q6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&q=unmoderated%20online%20communities&f=false\n\nFor game-specific instances, we can look at the well-publicized history of Riot Games and their community management practices. They've been quite vocal about who and why they did what they did. You can go back to prehistory and read the book-length case study of LambdaMOO by Julian Dibbell, *My Tiny Life*, best known for the excerpt \"A Rape in Cyberspace.\" Heck, you can look at how much time I spent on managing troublemakers in this joint presentation I gave at GDC clear back in 2002: http://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/how-to-manage-a-large-scale-online-gaming-community/ \n\nMy assertion was that voice affects things negatively \"a little bit, as an epiphenomenon,\" purely because it makes moderation more difficult. A far bigger issue is that lots of companies don't bother moderating at all. Quantitative research, such as that done by Dmitri Williams, shows that voice *does* increase human connection and a sense of liking and trust. It's certainly the highest bandwidth means of team coordination, and vital to games like *Destiny*. That said, games ranging from *Splatoon* (http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/9/8379367/splatoon-voice-chat-wii-u) to *Journey* have made conscious decisions not to include voice chat because of the tradeoffs it incurs.

But we didn't know how to handle our windfall.  We got trusted recommendations for professional help and ended up at Merrill Lynch.  We were seated at a shiny table in a swank conference room and our advisor brought us coffee and told us how special we were.  He provided a sleek \"customized\" investment plan in an elegant binder; the plan was almost certainly auto generated after clicking a list of options and printed out for us, but it was pretty.\n\nBut 4MM isn't special to these guys; we're just bread and butter to bring in fees and for their younger advisors to practice on.  He strongly encouraged consolidation of the portfolio to get all assets under their management, including (or especially?) things that didn't need management, such as our IRAs.  Which meant fees to transfer our IRAs in, and additional fees to transfer them back out when we escaped.  We were offered investment options with no more justification than \"this has performed very well for us in the past.\"  Most of the \"good investments\" he pushed us into performed quite poorly.  There were also mutual funds: high expense ratio funds (but so worth it, not even a full percent higher than less special funds) and front loaded funds (you need to expect to pay a bit up front for access to the good stuff, otherwise non-special people would want in).  And no matter how well or poorly the portfolio performed, 0.75% would be removed every year in addition to the fees. That's far from trivial when you run the numbers.\n\nIt was an expensive lesson.  But I learned it.  I educated myself and learned that there are no magic principals.  We got out.  My balanced portfolio of low cost vanguard funds has consistently met or outperformed its benchmarks for over a decade, unlike the Merrill portfolio that preceded it.  It's very little effort.  And I don't charge myself a dime.    \n\nThere ARE serious financial planners that will manage 4MM for a flat fee basis, if you don't want to do this yourself.  (I happen to be good friends with one.)  You can pay them for advice and execute it yourself (this is not hard, since they tell you how to do it) or you can provide limited authorization without actually turning over your funds to them. This works best if you aren't constantly churning your investments - and most people should not be constantly churning their investments.  \n\nHowever if you simply want to turn over all your money and not be bothered paying attention, the crook thing is probably a bigger concern - better to stick with a big bank and pay your percentage.

I explicitly said - repeatedly - that the I *could* do more, sacrifice more, bring myself closer to poverty in order to bring up people on the other side of that awful line and that the extent to which I *don't* makes me a hypocrite.\n\nThat, said your whole line of reasoning is utter bullshit. It's basically a regurgitation of the absurd Biblical imperitive \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\" You don't have to live a perfect life to critique and challenge inequity and injustice.

Virtually no one says \"nobody deserves anything, so let's just dissolve global capitalism because wealth and ownership is a legal fiction constructed to serve the rich, and just give everyone what they need to live a happy, healthy, and personally meaningful life, filled with high quality interpersonal relationships.\"\n\nBecause let's be real, if **nobody** really deserves **anything** than you've got two basic paths to go down.

Why is it so binary? You conveniently ignore the middle option, with moderation and not black and white: do whatever you feel like. That's what I do, what most rich people do, and what you seem to be doing with your slave- and pollution-built computer/phone. One time I gave a homeless guy 10 bucks. Another time I bought a whole breakfast for another guy. Sometimes I don't feel like giving away money, so I ignore them as I walk by.

You mentioned that Clinton was a little unpopular at the time for selling the Third Way shtick, but I think that doesn't give the full impression of '92, where the lesson learned after the uber-centrist Dukakis was for most of the party \"be even more right-leaning\" and undersells the schism between the Brown/Tsongas wing (if you can call it that) and the Clinton wing. Plus, for 2000, there was still Bradley. \n\nI don't think this changes any of the substance of your argument, which was very well argued and well written, but I'd still be interested to hear why you think the Clinton years were less divided between the moderates and the progressives. ", "id": "d44m0r8"}, {"comment": "You ask good questions.  I'm not sure I have an answer for you, but I can give you three different answer.  When in power, I think the president is a pretty clear leader of the party and, in general, there tends to be less open criticism of him by his own party, especially at the grassroots popular level (again, look at the *Party in the Streets* book about how Obama winning was the worst thing for the anti-War movement).  I think the Clinton years were less divided between the moderates and the progressive for the same reason the Reagan years and the Bush I and II years seem less divided between the Establishment and the Conservative movement.  While in power, they need to play nice.  You'll some occasional fights between the wings (the public option for Obamacare comes to my mind), but for the most part it's in their interest to cooperate while in power.  I would predict, for example, that the Republican Freedom Caucus would be less obstinate with a Republican President.\n\nBut a more honest answer is, I partially just know less about it, and have thought less about it.  I was born in 1985, which means I lived through that era and never felt the need to look into the details as intensely, but also was less aware of what was happening in the political word.  I know about the New Democrats, but I know less about how they were opposed, especially after Clinton won in 1992.  \n\nAnd part of what I'm talking about is excitement.  I remember Bill Bradley, no one was excited for Bill Bradley.  He didn't win a state.  He was the Washington Generals to Al Gore's Globe Trotters.  Though Bradley was to the left of Gore policy wise, I don't remember my very liberal suburban Massachusetts milieu being particularly excited about Bradley.  No one talked about Bradley like people talked about Nader later in the year.  As I hope I made clear above, there's a tremendous amount to politics that's not just policy positions but things like \"charisma\".  It's what sank Scott Walker this year.  I don't think Bradley really inspired that many people.  But you're absolutely right, I did mostly skip '92 because I don't really know the details of it, I realize.\n\nAnd I think that's one last thing about that Clinton years.  Economically, Clinton was to the right of many Democrats.  But he also had the charisma to bridge that gap, especially with progressive voters.  People believed that he could \"feel their pain\".  In fact, his exchange with a radical AIDS activist from ACT UP provided one of the memorable parts of the nomination process:\n\n>ACT UP member Bob Rafsky: We're not dying of AIDS as much as we are dying of 11 years of government neglect.\n\n>Clinton: I feel your pain.\n\nThe line became a staple of Clinton impressions for years (just like Bush I's \"wouldn't be prudent\" and Nixon's \"I am not a crook\" did) because people felt it captured something of the way Clinton interacted with the public.  Despite the clear differences on policy issues, Clinton's personal charisma carried his appeal outside of his \"natural base\" in the party.\n\nHe definitely made some famous moves that in retrospect have pissed off the progressive wing, deregulation and Welfare reform come to mind, but he also push some things that were important to the progressive wing--I'm thinking of his good faith effort on comprehensive health care reform (my mom put a \"Single Payer Healthcare\" sticker on her car around this time) and, when that failed, he got SCHIP through, which was at least a tangible success for the liberal wing.  I remember the progressive wing very worried about Clinton's \"ending welfare as we know it\" while it was being negotiated, but the policy wasn't an immediate during the late 90's economic boom.  When he left office, I get the sense that Progressive didn't think it was so bad (in the last 5-10 years, I think some have changed their opinions, though it's not something I've look at closely).  Similarly, the economy was so successful that the declining power of organized labor was something that was barely lamented at the time Especially in his first two years, with a Democratic congress, he got a lot done, many things that fit the progressive agenda: Family and Medical Leave, funding for international family planning, the Brady Bill, expanding the earned income tax credit, he got gays in the military (through a moderate compromise, of course, but still a \"point\"), hiring openly gay people in his administration, banning discrimination based on secular orientation, etc. Even though there was plenty the progressive wing didn't like--NAFTA, welfare reform, a \"law and order\" approach to crime, DOMA, the repeal of Glass-Stiegal--he did get a lot of things done, especially early on, that made them happy.\n\nAs for Gore, I think he was trying to draft off of Clinton's charisma without picking up Clinton's baggage (the scandals, both sexual and non-sexual).

It's very possible that Trump's political thought could become dominant in one wing of the party, but it's not immediately clear which wing that would be.  \n\nIt may be that the Republican Party is turning into the confusing big tent party that the Democrats were (I talk about that in another post on this page--look for \"big tent\"), with the Libertarians, the pro-Business establishment conservatives, the Tax Hawks, the Foreign Policy Hawks, the Trumpian Border Hawks, the Religious Right, the Movement Conservatives, and Gun Owners all just forming important interest groups within the Republican Party.

As you imply, they've been in the Wilderness for a while now. They were fellow travelers in the Reagan Revolution, but not deep believers. Pat Buchanan (though he's deeply religiously conservative as well) is probably the most well known Paleoconservative today. \n\nHis magazine *The American Conservative* has actually published a lot of great things. I forget his first name but Unz wrote a lot of great things for them. There's another neat article called \"Who Closed the American Mind\" by a Notre Dame philosophy professor that's a really wonderful reflection on Bloom's *The Closing of the American Mind*. I tend to find far more I like in *The American Conservative* than in a standard Movement Conservative magazine like *The National Review*. \n\nThe problem is, a lot of the rest of the Paleoconservative movement is deeply racist. *The American Conservative* has held the line on this issue, and will not accept it. Unz had a cover story looking at Hispanic crime in America that argued that Hispanics actually commit crime at similar, or maybe even lower, rates than whites. They fired John (?) Derbyshire for writing something that was pretty unambiguously racialist. Most of the other Paleoconservative magazines are perfectly willing to go down this road. The second most prominent Paleoconservative publication might be Vdare (named after the first white baby born in America, Virginia Dare) and regularly publishes racialist things. I think Derbyshire ended up there. I forget the names of other big Paleoconservative websites, but they're similar. \n\nOn social issues, Trump often does sound very Paleoconservative, but often taking what are in my opinion the worst part of the movement (a reality TV star makes a poor spokesperson for the values and morality of Western Civilization going back to Rome, Athens, and Jerusalem).

This is a lot of links, please don't mistake that volume for being a faintly comprehensive summary of the entire debate and larger context around it - this is a two-year process of change that involved (theoretically, at least it offered involvement even if that many people didn't actually participate) and affected some thirty to sixty thousand people, as well as defining the later progress and development of this community.  *Much* of the discussion took place in the comments of normal submissions to DH from that era, as well as in modmail directly; neither of those are reasonable to try and catalogue here & now.  \n\n[This is BS9K's charter post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/bkd0n/what_is_depthhub_what_does_it_do/).  Neither he nor we have clung to it absolutely, the sub has grown into many of the things it aspired to, and outgrown a couple along the way.  \n\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/djhco/just_a_reminder_depthhub_is_for_connecting_people/) post isn't super *directly* relevant, but it's the first time this community started growing fast.  The comments in there fearing the death of the community due to scale and how 'this is the beginning of the end' are the same type of user we got, and get, mod-mail from about this stuff.  They want a specific type of sub, but are often so daunted by responses like yours here to requests for more moderation or maintenance of standards that they try and participate normally but express their concerns to us directly.  Again in general, those users' participation in the comments is of far higher value and far more \"DH worthy\" in and of itself than the low-effort shitposting and flamebaiting you're disappointed we remove.  \n\nI can't find the 'change in moderation' post where he was initially looking to fill his team and explain his rationale; gist was that the community had grown too much and was too busy, and DH was requiring more moderation than he had time for, of a type that he didn't want to be doing.  \n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/sdear/a_change_of_moderation_p2/) is P2, where he's announcing the addition of us four to the team and explaining he'd wanted out entirely but was asked would be staying on as a figurehead and leader.\n\nI also can't find a 'retirement' post either, but I'm pretty sure he made one when he stepped off the team entirely.  I can't remember when that took place offhand, so this line item in may be out of place as far as timelines.  \n\nAs far as how we came to be a place that doesn't compromise on 'these types of mod-enforced subjective standards' ...\n\n[One](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/tonn3/mod_meta_lets_talk_about_the_dh_rules_aka_the/), in which I'm bitching and moaning about people reporting shit that isn't against the rules we had, and how 'report' isn't a good way to try and teach mods what the community thinks ought to be removed.  Most of the mod team is visible through that thread arguing in favour of needing a clear rule or rules to defined what is or is not depthhub content.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/tonn3/mod_meta_lets_talk_about_the_dh_rules_aka_the/c4okqhi?context=3) for instance where I'm clear I'm uncomfortable with (the system we now have) because adopting it would lead to (the exact sort of ideological accusations you're making now).\n\n[Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/vhmnn/mod_meta_so_guys_content_rules_how_to_define_what/), again by me, responding to the requests in the dialogue from the prior post for heavier enforcement of standards, challenging the community to write a clear rule or two we can use.  Again, in the comments, myself and others from the team expressing our discomfort with subjective models for the community.  Note there's more focus on discussion standards as well as submission content in this conversation than the prior, but I wrote the post thinking of and responding to earlier submission content concerns.  Again, [against](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/vhmnn/mod_meta_so_guys_content_rules_how_to_define_what/c54lvcw) subjective standards, and [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/vhmnn/mod_meta_so_guys_content_rules_how_to_define_what/c54lndt?context=2) you can see the beginnings of the request that we 'figure it out' without hard, clear, rules.  \n\n[Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10gmf4/meta_mod_on_the_future_of_depthhub/), by bmeckel, posing a final poll question looking for a decision on the matter from the community - and posing the three vague options that were clear leading suggestions as potential options.  You can see the tone of those comments is almost more \"get on with it mods!\" than anything else.  [BS9K shares his opinions](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10gmf4/meta_mod_on_the_future_of_depthhub/c6ddea7), with the leading caution that \"no one should take my opinion as law.\"  His preference was that dissatisfied users largely drown out poorer content, and explicitly stated that nothing fair and transparent could limit the content the community wanted limited.  In a follow-up, he's [pretty clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10gmf4/meta_mod_on_the_future_of_depthhub/c6deuza) that leaving it to voters is not a viable way of handling content problems.  Throughout, you can [see myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10gmf4/meta_mod_on_the_future_of_depthhub/c6de7ch?context=4) and [others from the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10gmf4/meta_mod_on_the_future_of_depthhub/c6dbc6v?context=1) still expressing discomfort with the subjective model that the commentary there is leaning fairly heavily towards.  \n\nFollowing post three, we also recieved a bunch of mod-mail from people on all sides of the discussion, mostly with feedback and suggestions, but some were more directed support for various specific suggested models.  We got a number that amounted to \"get on with it\" and even a few accusing us of deliberately delaying taking necessary action in the name of wanting rules. \n\n[Four](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/), in which we give in and go subjective.  We tested other suggestions from the same process at the same time and over the next couple of months, the \"header script\" was dropped because no one made them and we would have been removing everything if we enforced that rule.  The complaints about DH content rule, and approach (\"convince us\") has survived to today.  A lot of the discussion from that thread is described and linked from the body text, so I don't need to here.  Thankfully.  I do make a point of noting [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hi3fq?context=1) where I now think I was fairly openly showing both my frustration and my anxiety around the possibility that something that the community had pushed [M] into backfiring on the team, as well as the fact that inevitable disagreements are what the community signed up for when they asked this of us.  \n\n*All* of this obviously omits a fairly large body of both subsequent and parallel discussions around the tone of the whole place as a whole, many of these were around a perceived or real drop in the quality of in-house DH commentary and dialogue as well as the things offered up for discussion.  Those almost entirely fall into the \"shit that was mostly debated in the comments of other posts\" as users were super prone to trying to fight it out themselves as to why this other guys comment was shit and shouldn't have been posted to DH ... with fairly predictably productive results.  Our rule around 'criticism' of submissions in the comments was a direct result of both the desire for community involvement in our learning process, and complaints about the state of our own comments' sections, largely that they had become primarily trolling, bickering, meta bullshit, shitposting, and whinging about how 'this isn't depthhub~!' rather than people at least trying to intelligently discuss the submitted content itself.\n\n**TLDR?**: That's all is a very long and tangential way of being clear why I'm so blunt about how this space is run.  We - the mod team - were pushed into this subjectivity because our community was too impatient for a fix to wait on having clear rules.  We understand the frustration they felt, and we understood *even then* the frustration you feel now; but we got there, and now that bridge been crossed.  This was the deal 'you' guys brokered.  If you were here back when BS9K was running this sub, you had the opportunity to help us turn out different.\n\n>The last time I checked in here, blackstar9000 was advocating against these types of mod-enforced subjective standards.\n\nYes, that's exactly why he turned it over to us.  He couldn't continue to run the sub effectively, keep subscribers happy, *and* have the minimalist, clear, rules that he was philosophically drawn to.  \n\n>I'm surprised that there was such a large change in the community sentiment that you're comfortable making statements on behalf of everyone.\n\nIt's a pity you've not checked in at any point in the past three or four years since that change began taking place, or this wouldn't feel like such a sudden surprise to you.  I have been 'working' here for more than four years now, I see ~80% of submitted posts and ~60-90% of comments posted (mod/about/unmoderated, mod/comments/new), so the tone and general perspective of this community seems quite evident to me, and alongside it feels like part of my responsibility to this community to keep abreast of how our users feel about the content we feature and host.

In five of the seven that include him, GWB is among the worst ten (of the other two, one was shortly after 9/11, which he handled well, and the other was conducted by the WSJ in 2005). However, there's just no way he's one of the worst five. In *none* of those surveys is among the worst five. Always consistently toward the bottom:\n\n * Buchanan (for doing very little to prevent the immediate onset of the Civil War, which started as he left office)\n\n * Harding (corrupt, ineffective adminstration--you might remember the Teapot Dome scandal from some multiple choice test in history class, but that was one of many scandals)\n\n * Pierce (like Buchanan whom he preceeded, he only exacerbated the tensions that led to the Civil War, especially through the Kansas-Nebraska act which resulted in \"Bleeding Kansas\"; wasn't even nominated for reelection by his own party). \n\n * Andrew Johnson (probably my choice for worst, did nothing for the freed slaves and let the South reestablish de facto slavery under a new name; at complete loggerheads with congress; so unpopular he was impeached by the House)\n\nThen you get do-nothing presidents like William Henry Harrison (he died in thirty days), Millard Filmore (took over after Taylor died; not renominates in 1852 in large part because of how unpopular the Fugitive Slave Act that he signed as part of the Missouri Compromise was), Chester A. Arthur (I bet half of you are wondering if that guy was even president or just a 19th century name I made up), Tyler (most of his cabinet even resigned), Gerald Ford, Carter (who had the economic malaise plus the Iran Hostages), Garfield (not bad overall, but died in 200 days, many of which were spent painfully dying). \n\nThen you have a lot of other people who did bad things while in office. You have people like Taylor (the Mexican-American War), Grant (great general, personally moral, but hugely corrupt administration), Hoover (his handling of the Depression), Coolidge (I don't think he deserve quite such a negative reputation but his laissez-faire economic policies have sometimes been argued to have set up the Depression), McKinley (most people remember him positively, but went to War over a lie in the Spanish-American War), Andrew Jackson (these ranking lists generally put him in the top ten but that dude sucks--ignored the Supreme Court and let Native Americans be illegally expelled, introduced \"the spoils system\" to civil service, and basically single-handledly caused the Depression of 1837, though to be fair he handled nullification well), fucking Nixon (fucking *Nixon*). \n\nI don't think historians will be particularly kind to George W. Bush' but there's just no way that, because of the Iraq War, GWB is in the top five worst. No way. None. The first four I bullet pointed are the consensus picks for bottom of the barrel. You'd have to think the Iraq War (which is really all he argues) was worse than everything Nixon did, all the other corrupt administrations like Grant's, worse than the Mexican-American and Spanish-American Wars (really wars we didn't have to get into), worse than Carter's handling of the economy, worse than Lyndon Johnson's escalation in Vietnam (though LBJ actually did a lot of good things that are easy to point to and he's always ranked in the top half), worse than Andrew Johnson's ignoring congressional acts, killing Indians, and causing depression, etc etc. \n\nDepending on how you count all the do nothing presidencies, sure, GWB is quite possibly to probably in the bottom 10, but it's narrow sighted to even imply \"George W.

Not the fault of Harding; Fed chairman Benjamin Strong came into office under the Wilson administration.

Why?  Not saying I agree with the decision to go to war and that it hasn't turned out to be a complete failure; I'm just not following why Iraq was worse than, say Wilson's decision to enter WWI, Truman's to drop the atomic bombs or enter Korea, or Kennedy's to enter Vietnam.  All had arguably more catastrophic results than the Iraq war.\n\n2) No other candidate would have gone to war in Iraq, which solidifies GWB's place in the bottom 5.  Where's the support for this?

In five of the seven that include him, GWB is among the worst ten (of the other two, one was shortly after 9/11, which he handled well, and the other was conducted by the WSJ in 2005). However, there's just no way he's one of the worst five. In *none* of those surveys is among the worst five. Always consistently toward the bottom:\n\n * Buchanan (for doing very little to prevent the immediate onset of the Civil War, which started as he left office)\n\n * Harding (corrupt, ineffective adminstration--you might remember the Teapot Dome scandal from some multiple choice test in history class, but that was one of many scandals)\n\n * Pierce (like Buchanan whom he preceeded, he only exacerbated the tensions that led to the Civil War, especially through the Kansas-Nebraska act which resulted in \"Bleeding Kansas\"; wasn't even nominated for reelection by his own party). \n\n * Andrew Johnson (probably my choice for worst, did nothing for the freed slaves and let the South reestablish de facto slavery under a new name; at complete loggerheads with congress; so unpopular he was impeached by the House)\n\nThen you get do-nothing presidents like William Henry Harrison (he died in thirty days), Millard Filmore (took over after Taylor died; not renominates in 1852 in large part because of how unpopular the Fugitive Slave Act that he signed as part of the Missouri Compromise was), Chester A. Arthur (I bet half of you are wondering if that guy was even president or just a 19th century name I made up), Tyler (most of his cabinet even resigned), Gerald Ford, Carter (who had the economic malaise plus the Iran Hostages), Garfield (not bad overall, but died in 200 days, many of which were spent painfully dying). \n\nThen you have a lot of other people who did bad things while in office. You have people like Taylor (the Mexican-American War), Grant (great general, personally moral, but hugely corrupt administration), Hoover (his handling of the Depression), Coolidge (I don't think he deserve quite such a negative reputation but his laissez-faire economic policies have sometimes been argued to have set up the Depression), McKinley (most people remember him positively, but went to War over a lie in the Spanish-American War), Andrew Jackson (these ranking lists generally put him in the top ten but that dude sucks--ignored the Supreme Court and let Native Americans be illegally expelled, introduced \"the spoils system\" to civil service, and basically single-handledly caused the Depression of 1837, though to be fair he handled nullification well), fucking Nixon (fucking *Nixon*). \n\nI don't think historians will be particularly kind to George W. Bush' but there's just no way that, because of the Iraq War, GWB is in the top five worst. No way. None. The first four I bullet pointed are the consensus picks for bottom of the barrel. You'd have to think the Iraq War (which is really all he argues) was worse than everything Nixon did, all the other corrupt administrations like Grant's, worse than the Mexican-American and Spanish-American Wars (really wars we didn't have to get into), worse than Carter's handling of the economy, worse than Lyndon Johnson's escalation in Vietnam (though LBJ actually did a lot of good things that are easy to point to and he's always ranked in the top half), worse than Andrew Johnson's ignoring congressional acts, killing Indians, and causing depression, etc etc. \n\nDepending on how you count all the do nothing presidencies, sure, GWB is quite possibly to probably in the bottom 10, but it's narrow sighted to even imply \"George W.

The 70's would have sucked balls economically under any president, and the Spanish- & Mexican-American wars would likely have gone forward under anyone. Vietnam would not have been less of a boondoggle under, say, McCormack if Johnson had refused to continue it and the CIA had offed him too. And there's plenty more in W to hate than Iraq; the guy was a failure at every level; a C-student allowed to take the reigns of the most powerful nation on the planet because of who his daddy was, and then just to make it worse the motherfucker was named George(although admittedly not the Third). Fucking embarrassing. Compared to legalizing torture, I find it difficult to indict any US president more than W, excepting the aforementioned fuckface Tricky Dick.

To say nothing of all the Treaties he voided unilaterally with Native American tribes. And did I mention that time he caused a national depression? I can't believe that dude's on our money. \n\nAs an aside, I don't think his middling grades or who his father was has much barring on how good or bad a President George W. Bush was. And if we're going to give people passes for things like starting the Mexican-American War, starting the Spanish-American War, how the Vietnam War was conducted, and the 1970's stagflation (which until it happened economists thought was literally impossible), then I think it's possible Bush gets something of a pass for the PATRIOT Act as well. It was opposed by one senator (good old Russ Feingold) and Obama has signed it's renewal in 2011 and again (with some revision) in 2015. My point here isn't that we should \"give Bush a pass\" for that, but that it's much easier to say from 2015 that those things were destined to happen. In 2115, people will probably think that in those backwards times, something like the PATRIOT Act was \"destined\" to happen after 9/11, given the times. The Mexican-American War, for example, was hugely controversial at the time, with Whigs largely opposed. And while the Iraq War was at least nominally meant to spread democracy, the Mexican-American War was an expensive and bloody pro-slavery land grab (many Whigs felt the money could be better spent helping industrialization rather than the expansion of slavery). The pro-slavery aspects were very controversial, and led to people like Fredrick Douglas and Lincoln vehemently opposing the War. Lincoln, for example, more openly questioned the Democrat's evidence that led to the War than Democrats questioned Bush's evidence. Remember, this is the war that Henry David Thoreau refused to pay taxes for, resulting in his famous essay *Civil Disobedience*. We must see Bush and the alternative paths, but we also must see the alternative paths of the past.\n\nStill, if you accept the top four I bullet pointed above as being extraordinarily bad, even if you just include Nixon, Bush isn't in the top five. It's really hard to make an argument that Bush is in the top five worst. Top ten, much easier to argue. \n\nBut any actual assessment needs to weigh the good with the bad. I think his inition response to Sept 11 was good (other presidents might have been similar but I think he did well here, other than the PATRIOT Act, which I agree was very bad).  I think getting congress behind TARP was important. I think a lot of things Republicans criticize him for were good--his K-12 education reform (this was steps in the right direction), his expansion of Medicare. I think his tax policy was disastrous (turning surplus into debt) as was his handling of Hurricaine Katrina. I dislike his handling of stem cell research, but thought he did an excellent job working for comprehensive immigration reform even if his efforts resulted in nothing. I think the US attorney dismissals should have been a bigger scandal than they were. I agree his axis of evil distracted from actual terrorism that posed and continues to pose a threat to US interests. His AIDS work in Africa is a clear point toward him. As a minor point, I liked his mission to Mars idea, but [there was no follow through](http://www.theonion.com/article/bush-still-working-on-manned-mission-to-mars-quiet-18154). \n\nLook, I'm not some Republican diehard here. I try not to make political stands on Reddit, but I consistently vote Democrat, I walked out of high school the first day of bombing in the Iraq War, etc. If I listed them all out, I'd probably put Bush II in the bottom 25%, that is, the among the ten or so worst.

China in 1979 was broke and poor, even if it wanted to, it literally did not have the money to build factories and buy materials from abroad in the amount needed. It couldn't borrow money from the Soviets because of the split, and in either case the Soviets did not have much to spare going into the 1980's. The first wave of new factories were built with heavy Western involvement, none of which would be possible without access to Western capital or loans.\n\nCamp David didn't \"solve\" the middle east problem, but since then there has been no open warfare between Israel and the Arab states, whereas before Camp David, there was an actual shooting war between Israel and the Arab states about once every decade or so.\n\nFor sure hundreds and even thousands of people died in the Intifadas and other insurgent activities, but compared to the 6-day war or Yom Kippur, where 40,000 people were killed in the span of a few weeks?

Back then they couldn't just embed reporters and spoon-feed them bullshit, dead US soldiers were all over the nightly news and **that** was responsible for the end of the war more than anything else. And a generation living with those consequences put the US on the inevitable road to ending the draft as well - it's not necessarily gone forever, technically the machinery to reinstate it still exists, and may be exercised yet.\n\nI assert that the Chinese had to move in the direction of Capitalism and seek investment from the West no matter what anyone did; indeed, even if they had healed the schism with the USSR somehow, the entire state-based communist economic model was headed for collapse and just would have played out with more instability or a possible shift to fascism. No hindsight on this is 20/20, because there's no guarantee that things internationally wouldn't have gotten a very different outcome, but it *might* have been a better outcome, and we'll never know. It's relatively solid to claim that Nixon smoothed this process, but to say it would have led to any other outcome as a certainty is not historically defensible.\n\nCamp David provided a temporary detente, but as we are all living through, it's not like it was a panacea or real solution; when shit blows up again, and it will, David will simply be seen as the delaying tactic it was, whether the end result is the genocide of the Palestinians and/or open war between Israel and another state.\n\nBy no means were OSHA, EPA or SALT as inevitable as above but I do think there were strong societal pressures in those directions and we likely would have seen similar, if perhaps not as effective, policies by a non-Nixon.

And while the Iraq War was at least nominally meant to spread democracy, the Mexican-American War was an expensive and bloody pro-slavery land grab (many Whigs felt the money could be better spent helping industrialization rather than the expansion of slavery). The pro-slavery aspects were very controversial, and led to people like Fredrick Douglas and Lincoln vehemently opposing the War. Lincoln, for example, more openly questioned the Democrat's evidence that led to the War than Democrats questioned Bush's evidence. Remember, this is the war that Henry David Thoreau refused to pay taxes for, resulting in his famous essay Civil Disobedience. We must see Bush and the alternative paths, but we also must see the alternative paths of the past.\n\nLikewise, Buchanan didn't just do nothing to prevent secession, but even before his inauguration he was politicking behind the scenes to get a broad decision in the *Dred Scott* case. He appointed a pro-slavery governor in \"bleeding Kansas\". He even removed moderate pro-\"popular sovereignty\" people from his administration even though they were members of his party, which really helped set up the split in the Democratic Party in the 1860 election (Buchanan openly supported the southern splitter candidate Breckinridge, not his old rival Douglas).  Many also question the response of Buchanan in the Utah War (unrelated to slavery and the coming Civil War). In the lead up to the split in the Union, Buchanan didn't just \"not do anything\", but ignored his generals in order to not do anything--basic preparations would have at least delayed conflict at Fort Sumter even if it wouldn't have prevented it. Buchanan blamed the succession crisis solely on the \"intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery in the Southern States\", and proposed pro-slavery solutions like an \"explanatory\" constitutional amendment saying yay slavery, which would reaffirmed the most controversial like fugitive slave laws and popular sovereignty in all territories. It should also be remembered that the firing on Fort Sumter happened while Buchanan was still President (and the direct conflict there was certainly exacerbated by his decisions). \n\nBut we might see it as a lack of action, but they still made choice--choices that were controversial even in their own times.

The later is symbolic of his general attempt to win over newly decolonized non-aligned countries (of course, part of this policy set in motion what would eventually become the Vietnam War, but it was more than that).  He \"gave hope\", his famous \"ich bin ein Berliner\" speech is emblematic of that, where he told our West German allies that the US would stand tall as East Germany and the Soviets were moving closer and becoming more threatening, but not in a way that particularly rattled the Soviets and made them potentially more aggressive.

Household printers are only for small runs of things that are interesting to only a few people. It's the same with 3d printing, and that's what it's been used for in the industry hobby printers became popular.

The stock market is part of the economy. The stock market isn't some magic rich person's casino where they're betting on the success of mega corporations. \n\nInvesting in a company gives that company capital to operate. If you buy shares in a company, they have more money to purchase things, like hiring new staff, leasing a new office, whatever. Yes the stock market abstracts that in a complicated way, but it's not some magic distinct entity.\n\nThat doesn't mean that there aren't good reasons to lower wealth descrepancy, but 'the rich aren't part of the economy' isn't one of them.\n\n>There are no spending offsets to cover the revenue lost in the tax cuts - so he wants to massively increase the deficit.\n\nIt's completely possible to lower taxes and increase tax revenue. \n\nIt's kinda important to remember that tax revenue isn't this lump sum thing that is directly proportional to tax rates. Ignoring tax brackets for a second, if we taxed everyone's income at 100% then it's likely that pretty much no one would work - because they'd have to pay all their income as tax. We would receive 0 tax revenue then.\n\nSimilarly, if we taxed 0% we would still receive 0 revenue even if everyone collected income. And you can imagine that if we taxed people 95% maybe only a few people would work, but we'd get a lot of tax off of them, so we wouldn't have very much revenue. And if we taxed 5%, we would get not very much revenue, off of lots of people.\n\nSo there must be a maximum amount of revenue that we can get somewhere between 0 and 100% rates. It could be that the graph is a bell curve, or that it has multiple peaks, but there is a maximum somewhere.\n\nSo it's completely possible that our tax rate is too high in terms of maximizing our revenue. Of course, the US has a very low effective income tax rate for the upper bracket, so I'm not saying that in practice lowering the rate is a good thing, but it's important to understand the concept. It's also important to understand that the vast majority of tax revenue comes from the highest brackets, so getting that amount optimal is very important.\n\nIt could be that the effective tax rate in the US is too low, but it's really important not to think of it in terms of increasing the rate means increasing the revenue.\n\n>Trade / Deportation / Immigration\n\nI think the criticisms here are correct, but I think if it was phrased more plainly reddit wouldn't like it. Reddit lately seems to be largely anti-trade, and anti-immigration.\n\nImmigration is good for the economy. More hands working is a good thing. Deportation is not the opposite of this, but you can see how it's connected. \n\nFree trade is also really good for the economy. If your friend is better at making bread, and you're better at making egg salad, it's really good for both of you to trade egg salad for bread so you can both have more egg salad sandwiches. By trading, you're working together and you both win. Your friend isn't stealing your egg salad jobs, and you're not stealing his bread job. It's not zero sum. This is a simplistic example, but in principle, there is a lot of truth to the analogy. Of course there are other effects like personal freedoms etc. but economically free trade is really a good thing. This is why tariffs are bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n"], [6, "[removed]"], [-11, "[removed]"], [-14, "Alright well here's my rebuttal. On trade look at our trade through the CAFTA-DR we have a surplus of 5 billion. Before NAFTA was signed our trade with those nations results in a 1.7 bullion surplus. Now we are at a 60 billion dollar deficit through that same agreement. The EPI has stated that NAFTA has cost american 850,000 thousand jobs while Clinton promised to GAIN 200,000 and Hillary still describes it as a beneficial deal for the USA. (She voted against the CAFTA-DR BTW)\n\nAs Secretary of state Hillary promised jobs would come from South Korean Bilateral Agreement she negotiated. It lost the country 75,000 instead of gaining the 70,000 she promised it would bring. \n\nNow let's get to the taxes. This is where shit gets real because to be honest I'm not sure where OP got his numbers from. First off this will be from the perspective on a single filer, single income. \n\nTrump's plan has 25,000 as a deduction (it is current at 6,300). What does this mean? It means the bottom 20% pay nothing. At all. Currently they pay on average 250. The second 20% would also pay almost nothing, specifically their taxable income would be 6,800 and at the rate of 12% the would pay 816/ year which represents a drop is 1,148 on average.\n\nThat there is the bottom 40% that OP claims pay a federal 0% tax (they don't). \n\nWhat is true about OP is that the top brackets get their taxes cut more. This is indeed the effect of a flat tax system as 4.9% of 250k is a lot more than 4.9% of 50k. Here's thing - when people focus on taxing the rich they're focused on a tiny tiny population. Trump will cut taxes by an average of 8% for the bottom 80% of Americans or 255 million people. On average those people would save 9,000 or 2.3 billion. The next 15% would account for 376 million in cuts, the next 4% would account for 283 million in cuts, the top 1% (oh no the EVIL) would account for 725 million in cuts. In other words the top 20% of the nation would see 1.4 billion in cuts with half of that going to the 1% (1.39 million people) who make most of the money in this nation. \n\n\nNow what about the corporate tax? Well even Obama agrees it needs to go down. Well Trump nukes it to 15% plus immediate expensing of investments. To compensate Trump wants to cut foreign deferrals essentially eliminating the practice of using foreign shells to spread tax liability and pay less tax overall because of it. What's more is that the 15% will apply to freelancers that work through an LLC. This is amazing for anyone that's self employed. \n\nFinally the OP completely failed to address the biggest cut of them all - childcare. Kids cost a lot, and Trump will give you a huge break in his plan. This deduction could offset as much as half of the already lowered income tax which is HUGE. \n\nBut you know, Trump is bad, all his policies are bad. Oh an finally let's address this whole deficit question. Obama doubled debt while decreasing it. The deficit doesn't matter, and everyone should stop pretending like we can get by without decreasing government spending in the future.

Yes the stock market abstracts that in a complicated way, but it's not some magic distinct entity.\n\nThat doesn't mean that there aren't good reasons to lower wealth descrepancy, but 'the rich aren't part of the economy' isn't one of them.\n\n>There are no spending offsets to cover the revenue lost in the tax cuts - so he wants to massively increase the deficit.\n\nIt's completely possible to lower taxes and increase tax revenue. \n\nIt's kinda important to remember that tax revenue isn't this lump sum thing that is directly proportional to tax rates. Ignoring tax brackets for a second, if we taxed everyone's income at 100% then it's likely that pretty much no one would work - because they'd have to pay all their income as tax. We would receive 0 tax revenue then.\n\nSimilarly, if we taxed 0% we would still receive 0 revenue even if everyone collected income. And you can imagine that if we taxed people 95% maybe only a few people would work, but we'd get a lot of tax off of them, so we wouldn't have very much revenue. And if we taxed 5%, we would get not very much revenue, off of lots of people.\n\nSo there must be a maximum amount of revenue that we can get somewhere between 0 and 100% rates. It could be that the graph is a bell curve, or that it has multiple peaks, but there is a maximum somewhere.\n\nSo it's completely possible that our tax rate is too high in terms of maximizing our revenue. Of course, the US has a very low effective income tax rate for the upper bracket, so I'm not saying that in practice lowering the rate is a good thing, but it's important to understand the concept. It's also important to understand that the vast majority of tax revenue comes from the highest brackets, so getting that amount optimal is very important.\n\nIt could be that the effective tax rate in the US is too low, but it's really important not to think of it in terms of increasing the rate means increasing the revenue.\n\n>Trade / Deportation / Immigration\n\nI think the criticisms here are correct, but I think if it was phrased more plainly reddit wouldn't like it. Reddit lately seems to be largely anti-trade, and anti-immigration.\n\nImmigration is good for the economy. More hands working is a good thing. Deportation is not the opposite of this, but you can see how it's connected. \n\nFree trade is also really good for the economy. If your friend is better at making bread, and you're better at making egg salad, it's really good for both of you to trade egg salad for bread so you can both have more egg salad sandwiches. By trading, you're working together and you both win. Your friend isn't stealing your egg salad jobs, and you're not stealing his bread job. It's not zero sum. This is a simplistic example, but in principle, there is a lot of truth to the analogy. Of course there are other effects like personal freedoms etc. but economically free trade is really a good thing. This is why tariffs are bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d6lhcjy"}, {"comment": "\"It's completely possible to lower taxes and increase tax revenue.\"\n\nSorry, that's not true.

On trade look at our trade through the CAFTA-DR we have a surplus of 5 billion. Before NAFTA was signed our trade with those nations results in a 1.7 bullion surplus. Now we are at a 60 billion dollar deficit through that same agreement. The EPI has stated that NAFTA has cost american 850,000 thousand jobs while Clinton promised to GAIN 200,000 and Hillary still describes it as a beneficial deal for the USA. (She voted against the CAFTA-DR BTW)\n\nAs Secretary of state Hillary promised jobs would come from South Korean Bilateral Agreement she negotiated. It lost the country 75,000 instead of gaining the 70,000 she promised it would bring. \n\nNow let's get to the taxes. This is where shit gets real because to be honest I'm not sure where OP got his numbers from. First off this will be from the perspective on a single filer, single income. \n\nTrump's plan has 25,000 as a deduction (it is current at 6,300). What does this mean? It means the bottom 20% pay nothing. At all. Currently they pay on average 250. The second 20% would also pay almost nothing, specifically their taxable income would be 6,800 and at the rate of 12% the would pay 816/ year which represents a drop is 1,148 on average.\n\nThat there is the bottom 40% that OP claims pay a federal 0% tax (they don't). \n\nWhat is true about OP is that the top brackets get their taxes cut more. This is indeed the effect of a flat tax system as 4.9% of 250k is a lot more than 4.9% of 50k. Here's thing - when people focus on taxing the rich they're focused on a tiny tiny population. Trump will cut taxes by an average of 8% for the bottom 80% of Americans or 255 million people. On average those people would save 9,000 or 2.3 billion. The next 15% would account for 376 million in cuts, the next 4% would account for 283 million in cuts, the top 1% (oh no the EVIL) would account for 725 million in cuts. In other words the top 20% of the nation would see 1.4 billion in cuts with half of that going to the 1% (1.39 million people) who make most of the money in this nation. \n\n\nNow what about the corporate tax? Well even Obama agrees it needs to go down. Well Trump nukes it to 15% plus immediate expensing of investments. To compensate Trump wants to cut foreign deferrals essentially eliminating the practice of using foreign shells to spread tax liability and pay less tax overall because of it. What's more is that the 15% will apply to freelancers that work through an LLC. This is amazing for anyone that's self employed. \n\nFinally the OP completely failed to address the biggest cut of them all - childcare. Kids cost a lot, and Trump will give you a huge break in his plan. This deduction could offset as much as half of the already lowered income tax which is HUGE. \n\nBut you know, Trump is bad, all his policies are bad.

I re-read it again after my initial post in this thread, and I still find it worth reading. It's somewhat amusing, and rather interesting. The way he addresses a problem I feel like I can relate to, in that he chooses a topic, and then wanders around the issue, poking at it from different angles and occasionally takes a detour before coming to a semi-conclusion, a bit from one side, a bit from the other, taking things he agrees with and acknowledging flaws in his own stance, with the final caveat that \"it's complicated.\" He asks some questions I had never considered before, gives some thoughtful insight, and this essay is the reason I own a (seldom-used) guide to language usage.

This is the way every VR game I've encountered these days does it, and it's fucking *wrong*. It's a novelty at best, a \"oh look at this!\" rather than a \"hey, I can play this for 10 hours straight.\"\n\nI want to play VR games the same way I play current games. I want to sit there with a controller in my hand, and I want the movement and interface to be controlled via the controller. If I push the left-stick forward, I should walk forward. If I push the left-stick to the right, I should strafe right. The headset should *only* be there to provide a 3D experience. I'm fine with being able to turn my head and look around, but it absolutely *should not* affect where my character is heading. I want my virtual head to be like my real head. I'm not a fucking tank that can only look in the direction I'm walking or aiming!\n\nAll this means that the \"looking around\" aspect of the VR experience should be *100% optional.* If I want to sit on my couch, with my head straight ahead, the game should be as playable as if it was on my TV (the only difference being it's now 3D).\n\nUntil VR game developers get this concept into their heads, I have *zero* interest in VR gaming.\n\n(I'm aware that my approach requires a controller, as keyboard/mouse would be pretty hard without being able to look down when your hand slides off the right keys... but, fuck it, you have to make some control simplification concessions when you can't actually *look* at your controller.)"], [7, "It's pretty accurate, but VR has more challenges to overcome than listed in that post.\n\nVR at the moment is like the very first movies. A lot of the VR demos are just about the novelty of one or two things you can do with VR, Similar to early movies that had sound, or colour, or basic editing for special effects. It's only over a century of continued progress and movie making that we've gone from 1 minute films of man on bike or people in a garden to what we have today.\n\nThings VR needs to do or questions that need answers are in no particular order\n\n1. Work out maximum and average times that average people can comfortably use the devices for. A 30 minute level might be fine if you're sitting on a couch, but 30 minutes of standing up and moving around and waving your arms is going to be exhausting for most people.\n2. Work out a system for naturally guiding a player's view to important parts of a scene for narrative purposes\n3. Massively improve performance of the hardware and modify existing graphics engines or design new ones to maintain constant framerate and frame draw time\n4. Develop a number of tricks and techniques for maintaining immersion while dealing with the limitations of the technology. Eg, is there a narrative way, or a technological way to get players to be more accepting of limitations of the physics interactions when trying to pick things up and have it feel natural without breaking immersion.\n5. What is going to be the 'standard' VR setup, how much room does a player have to walk around, how do you deal with players with less than a standard amount of room, or none. How do you handle players with more.\n6. If you're offering players freedom of movement, how do you guide their physical location to prevent them from walking into walls and keep them centred in their play area. How do you get them.\n7. In GTA I can fly a plane, ride bicycle, drive a car, and walk on foot and my immersion is not broken. How do you handle different modes of transport in a VR game?\n\nThere's more that need to be asked and answered too, but all of these questions need answers and solutions. Then someone can come along and start going ok, people can only really handle 10 minute chunks of activity at once, and they are in a play space about 3m x 3m and there's some fancy lighting techniques you can apply to a scene dynamically to naturally guide a player's attention to a certain direction, and there's a system in place that slight warps the perception of the VR so when you move it guides you back to the centre, even if you think you've just been walking forward the whole time. With all that in place AAA developers can start to try and craft big narrative experiences, but it's going to be a process of at least 5 to 15 years before we'll see games that begin to rival things like GTA5"], [4, "Fascinating information lucidly explained.

It's only over a century of continued progress and movie making that we've gone from 1 minute films of man on bike or people in a garden to what we have today.\n\nThings VR needs to do or questions that need answers are in no particular order\n\n1.

Massively improve performance of the hardware and modify existing graphics engines or design new ones to maintain constant framerate and frame draw time\n4. Develop a number of tricks and techniques for maintaining immersion while dealing with the limitations of the technology. Eg, is there a narrative way, or a technological way to get players to be more accepting of limitations of the physics interactions when trying to pick things up and have it feel natural without breaking immersion.\n5. What is going to be the 'standard' VR setup, how much room does a player have to walk around, how do you deal with players with less than a standard amount of room, or none. How do you handle players with more.\n6. If you're offering players freedom of movement, how do you guide their physical location to prevent them from walking into walls and keep them centred in their play area. How do you get them.\n7. In GTA I can fly a plane, ride bicycle, drive a car, and walk on foot and my immersion is not broken.

The abolitionist movement was drenched in religion, and that fuel moved champions like William Wilberforce and Sojourner Truth.

Generally Hebrews can be made slaves if they sell themselves and may be set free, but gentiles are to be treated as property to be bought and sold and passed down between generations. \n\nTo compare it to native American slavery think of it like this- it's not as if you kidnapped a wealthy white man out of his home at night you'd just get away with it.

But don't worry, if you want more slaves you just need to breed your first slave before his 6 years are up: \n\n>If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free. \n\n>You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property\n\n>You can will them to your children as inherited property\n\n>If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, 21 but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property\n\nSo yes, the Bible literally describes the precise intricacies of the process by which you may, *in the word of god* if you believe in the literal bible, buy and sell slaves. \n\nNo, it isn't exactly the same as native American slavery.

", "id": "d26xf47"}, {"comment": ">For example a Roman seeing XXIV wouldn't think twenty four because even our words betray the underlying system.\n\nIf you look at the [Latin names for numbers](http://blogs.transparent.com/latin/latin-numbers-1-100/), you can see they're based on a rough logic of tens, almost exactly like our own.  One is \u016bnus, ten is decem, eleven is \u016bndecim, twenty is v\u012bgint\u012b, twenty one is v\u012bgint\u012b \u016bnus, thirty is tr\u012bgint\u0101, thirty one is tr\u012bgint\u0101 \u016bnus, and so forth.  So, it's very much like ours.  Which is to say, *their* words betray an underlying system too, one that's all vaguely based around tens, just as ours is.   \n\nIt's not truly base ten, but is clearly based around tens.  For one, the teens are irregular in both Latin and English, which is a very common trait.  I think at least some irregularity in the teens occurs in all Indo-European languages, and it's definitely like this in some non-Indo-European languages (Hebrew for example).  In fact, I was surprised when I learned Turkish and the teens *weren't* exceptional at all (though the tens counting is stranger than in English or Latin.  Two is iki, twenty is yirmi, five is be\u015f, fifty is elli; they're completely unrelated).  Second, while the words for the tens are often related to the ones, they're not regularly derivable from each other.  You can't get twenty from two or fifty from five the same way you can get two hundred and five hundred.  I think the point of /u/functor7's post is that while there was some vague pattern to Roman numerals around fives and tens, the written numerals themselves didn't follow a predictable, infinite pattern of base-anything, which makes many mathematical operations that we take for granted exceedingly difficult.  \n\n> Similarly how did people think about and name numbers when they were just lines on a stick?\n\n\nAs for where the names came from, oral numbers always have preceded written numbers.  As for why our oral numbers in most languages are based roughly around ten, I've heard the major theory is our ten fingers formed the basis for counting generally.  Counting seems to be something that developed a while after language, however, and to this day there are some small scale societies who do not count.  Generally, their systems are something like \"one\", \"two\", \"many\", see this [blog entry](https://numberwarrior.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/is-one-two-many-a-myth/) for example, as it gives examples of several. The Pirah\u00e3 of the Amazon seem to be a special case, in that they seem to lack numbers entirely, having only words for \"a small amount\" and a \"large amount\".  For more on that, here's a discussion of that on the excellent linguistics blog [Language Log](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001364.html) and also a longer story on linguist/anthropologist Dan Everett and the Pirah\u00e3 from the *New Yorker* [here](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/04/16/the-interpreter-2) (which deals with the many several linguistic oddities of the Pirah\u00e3 language) and a short one from *Slate* that partially relies on the *New Yorker* article but specifically deals with Pirah\u00e3 numeracy [here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/10/16/piraha_cognitive_anumeracy_in_a_language_without_numbers.html).", "id": "d270cdg"}], [{"comment": "Not wanting to start a full-on debate, but isn't the logic he arrives at seem to be the same vein under which the current \"common core\" math being taught in the USA has evolved?", "id": "d27auy6"}, {"comment": "Yes.

It downloads from iTunes and lets me search only podcats. Every podcast I listen to mentions that they are available from \"iTunes, Stitcher,  SoundCloud, or wherever you get your podcasts\", so I imagine the Stitcher app and the SoundCloud app both work well for Android. I separately bought (for three dollars each) the Radiolab and the This American Life apps so I could listen to unlimited old episodes (most shows have free archives).\n\n**Classics**:  these are the ones that many, many people listen.\n\n * *This American Life*.  A public radio show that tells interesting stories on a huge variety of topics, they cover everything from lost love to explaining the Financial Crisis (this is a particularly great episode) to looking at violence in Chicago schools to David Sedaris explaining his awkward family vacations.  It is usually 2-5 stories loosely organized around a common theme, some funny some sad many thought-provoking.\n\n * *Radiolab*.  Originally like a This American Life for science, they've spread out and now officially cover \"curiosity\" or \"imagination\" or something like that, which means that they still cover a lot of science but mix in some history and philosophy now and then.\n\n * *Serial*.  This tells one story over the course of a season, in incredibly depth.  Serial was one of the first big stand out hits (season two just ended, but season one is better than season two).  The first season covers a young man convicted of murdering his high school exgirlfriend who maintains he was innocent, and throughout the season you're just really not sure if he did it or not.\n\n**American Politics**\n\n\n * *FiveThirtyEight Elections*.  From the website FiveThirtyEight, mostly statisticians and journalists come together to explain political things as neutrally as possible. Indispensable.\n\n * *Slate's Whistlestop*.  The host of *Face the Nation* looks at important moments of election history and ends up explaining the entire presidential election that year, and often whole swings party politics.  \n\n * *Slate's Political Gabfest*.  Good if you're interested in politics. Democrat-leaning. Host of Whistlestop is one of the three co-hosts, along with Emily Bazelon (a writer for the NYT Magazine) and the of CEO of Atlas Obscura.\n\n * Vox's *the Weeds*.  A show that's meant to \"get into the weeds of\" policy and politics.  Loves getting wonky. *The Ezra Klein Show* (Ezra Klein is a co-host on the Weeds and the editor of Vox) has a similar audience.\n\n * If this somehow isn't enough, there's also the *NPR Politics Podcast* and *Keeping it 1600* with Obama's former speechwriter.\n\n**Learning Stuff**.  This is what I love about podcasts.\n\n * *99% Invisible*.  This maybe belongs in the \"classics\" section, since everyone who loves podcasts knows this one, too.  It's about \"design\" (\"good design is 99% invisible\"), but like Radiolab, its interests have only expanded.  They had one about how sound plays a role in products (like the Apple turning on sound and the sound of Chile's fajitas) and one about the history of neon signs and one about old New York flop houses, but just all these wonderful stories of how many things, familiar and unfamilar, came to be.\n\n * *Criminal*.  A show that covers crimes of various kinds.  I prefer the earlier episodes, they remind me of Serial.  \n\n * *What's the Point*.  Also from FiveThirtyEight, a show generally about \"data\".\n\n * *Surprisingly Awesome*.  Takes a deep look at one mundane thing a week and explains why it's \"surprisingly awesome\".  I'm getting a little tired of the shtick and listen to half the episodes.\n\n * *Stuff You Should Know*.  More a conversation (almost talk radio style) than most of the podcasts I like, but can go deep on topics.  I don't actually like the format that much so I don't listen to it much, but it's simultaneously informative and \"talk-showy\", if that's something you like.\n\n**Arts and Culture**\n\n * *Imaginary Worlds*.  This covers sci-fi, fantasy, comics, etc. but almost should be in the \"learn stuff\" section.  Great even for those (like me) who have a really passing interest in this stuff (like I'll watch the comic book movies, but I never really read comics).  Amazingly well done.\n\n\n * *The Allusionist*.  A show about words and language.  To be honest, I find the host slightly annoying (most people don't) but the show is still usually great.\n\n * *Song Exploder*.  Takes a song and then explains how all the different parts of it were made and come together.  It makes a surprisingly good listen.  The host is a musician himself and as a solo artist recorded electro singer-song writer music (think of a more somber *The Postal Service*) that was put out on a label that put out mostly hardcore punk, which I think gives you a sense of his own personal range of taste.\n\n * *Snap Judgement*. A show like *This American Life*, in that it's all people telling stories, and while the sound track is better, I prefer *TAL*.  I also sometimes like and sometimes dislike this host, who tells a long \n\n * *The Moth.*  Similar to *Snap Judgment*, but with emphasis on people telling stories live, not the sound design of the piece. Stories can be funny or sad.\n\n * *Love + Radio*.  The fourth podcast of this \"story-telling genre\" along with *TAL* and the above to, Love + Radio feels like a little arty, a little weirder.  \n\n * *Modern Love*.  People reading and discussing the NYT's Modern Love column.  Very moving.\n\n * *On Being*.  This one is very popular, one of the most popular I think, but it just never clicked with me.  Interview-based.  This is my cousin's favorite podcast.\n\n * *Death, Sex, and Money*.  I had the same reaction as On Being, but this is my sister's favorite podcast.  Interview-based.  These last three all have audiences that skew towards women. I am including them on this list even though I don't listen to them because I know a lot, a lot of people who I respect swear that these are some of the best podcasts out there. I think I'm just not a big fan of the host+single interview subject format.\n\n * *New Yorker Fiction Podcast*.  A podcast where an author recently published in the *New Yorker* reads one of the stories from the archives, and then discusses it with the fiction editor.  There's a similar one for poetry, *New Yorker Poetry Podcast*.  If you want more stories read, *Selected Shorts* is another podcast that does that, where the stories are read by actors, which you'd think would be better but they tend to be like...over emphasized, acted rather than lovingly read to your like how your mother or father used to.\n\n * *Reply All*.  \"About the internet\".\n\n**Economics and Social Science**\n\n * *Planet Money*.  I also put this one in the \"classics\" or the \"learning\" sections, this is one of the most entertaining podcasts out there.  Interesting even if you have little-to-no interest in business or money.\n\n * *Invisibilia*. This brought together former staffers from both Radiolab and This American Life (podcast royalty!). As a social scientist, I liked but didn't love this show (I felt they too often focused on the extreme cases). They choose interesting topics and used more science.\n\n * *Freakonomics*.  From the co-creator of the popular book series.  I got bored of this eventually, but still hugely popular.\n\n * *StartUp podcast*.  This was Gimlet Media's first show (founded and hosted by the original host of Planet Money) about founding Gimlet Media and trying to get a business off the ground more generally.  I've heard great things, especially from the first two seasons (once they have a solid company, it's less interesting, I've heard).\n\n**Comedy**\n\n * *How Did This Get Made?* three hosts--two of them stars of the show *The League*--watch and discuss a horrible movie.  But they make it so funny, it makes me actually want to see the movie.  This is the only comedy podcast I regularly listen to, but it's one of the podcasts I listen to the most.\n\n * *WTF with Marc Maron*.  A comedian interviewing another comedian.  I've only listened to a few episodes with friends.\n \n * *You Made It Weird*.  Same deal.  \n\nThere are also lots of other podcasts I don't listen to: sports, religion (well, I do--if you're Jewish I can recommend you some), history and sociology (there are several academic ones I listen to that I think general audiences might find boring, but also popular ones which I just don't like), music, movies, news, hobbies, whatever you're interested in.   There are also genres like narrative story-telling (Welcome to the Night Vale is the classic of this genre, I've heard) that I have just never gotten into.  And almost every network TV show has at least three fan podcasts (often even a semi-official podcast), just as one example of what's out there if you want to delve into. Sometimes I'll just listen to some public radio shows, like *On Point with Tom Ashbrook* or *On the Media*.  The above list may seem long, it's certainly more than I can listen to on a weekly basis, but it's also just meant to scratch the surface of what's out there.\n\nMany of those listed above are produced in networks. Some big networks include PRX, Panoply, Radiotopia, Earwolf, and Gimlet Media, plus big public radio/other media companies like the BCC, NPR, PRI, WNYC, ESPN, etc.  iTunes also has lists of the most popular shows (overall and by genre) and I imagine Stitcher does as well.  That's how I found several of these shows--looking at the iTunes charts and looking through the rosters of these big networks.  There's also the related genre of audiobooks (most often purchased through Audible.com and listened to on their app) that I haven't gotten into yet, but I've heard is similarly addicting. Most of my post-college life (now a decade) I've had an hour long commute, and these podcasts have made my commutes much easier.

Except for comedians, I think interview based podcasts tend to be more boring to general unless you're intimately interested in the subject. If the interview drags in a place but introduces a point returned to later, you can't edit it out--and most interview podcasts are straight conversations, anyway, they're pretty minimally edited. The thing is, that editing and scripting means it takes much more time to produce, even if content ends up much better (some people also like the live feel, but to be honest I have the opposite inclination and wish podcasts were more, rather than less, scripted). The easiest podcast to produce is the unscripted interview--it's also the least interesting. The people who devote themselves to podcasting first and expertise second (like Dan Carlin's hardcore history) tend to make better sounding podcasts but often end up with things that can play fast and loose with the facts.  In short, many academic podcasts sound kind of boring because many are kind of boring, and are only really meant for those with a deep interest in the subject who just want to listen to a conversation. \n\nSo that said, academic-y podcasts I listen are the ones that I'm really interested in: sociology has the Office Hours podcast (an unscripted interview) and the Contexts podcast (which I think is just the author reading an article not specifically adapted for podcasts). I think you can find a few more sociology podcasts on the Society Pages (google it). For history, I listen to the Ottoman History Podcast, and our own AskHistorians podcast, but there are many many more. /r/AskHistorians has had a few threads about this, [here's a relatively comprehensive one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/33rpmn/i_want_to_learn_by_listening_what_history/) (flaired members tend not to like Dan Carlin, who seems by far the most successful history podcaster, though he's a perennial favorite of people who prefer his tone and don't care about his inadvertent inaccuracies). I'm sure other fields have their own podcasts, but I don't know them. Oh, one I should add to the above list is Invisibilia, which is made by people associated with both Radiolab and This American Life (it's harder to get a better podcast pedigree) and is meant to be a social science podcast meant for general audiences. As a specialist, I found their first season a little disappointing (they never got things wrong, I just think they annoying always went to investigate the most extreme cases of something, rather than mixing the mundane with the extreme and showing that what they're talking about is everywhere).

Every time you or anyone else brakes, you're just converting kinetic energy to wasted heat. It's much better to visualize your stopping point as far back as you can and arrive there as smoothly as possible. If you drive a manual, you should rarely ever have to hit the brakes on a freeway (congestion excepted, obviously), and only at the last few feet approaching a stop light or other predictable stopping point.\n\nAnd what you said about not making people brake is part and parcel of what /u/wbeaty said about maintaining the gap behind you, not just ahead of you. In fact, I wish he/she had expounded a bit more on that point, because maintaining a large gap ahead of you is far less effective if you rigidly maintain a constant gap. The point of the gap is so that you can use it to absorb the traffic waves, both ahead of you *and behind.*\n\nI like to play a little harmless game on the freeway.

Worse, the fight produces a pinned density-wave, where the average flow inside this dense clot is extremely low, and so the wave grows larger and larger as more cars enter from upstream.\n\nWhen the merge-zone is working right, the single lane downstream is running at full capacity.   The state DOTs try to produce this result by installing signs reading \"[STAY IN LANE UNTIL MERGE POINT](https://www.google.com/search?q=\"stay+in+lane+until\"+zipper&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8).\"   Then, where the lane actually ends, \"MERGE HERE, TAKE YOUR TURN.\"   Search on \"Zipper Merge\" projects.\n", "id": "d2mua7s"}, {"comment": ">Downstream, the highway is almost empty\n\nIn some locations, maybe. \nHowever, every 2-1 lane transition or 4-3 lane transition that I deal with is always backed up for at least a mile past the actual choke point. \n\nIt's pretty simple math, unless you increase the velocity of traffic after the choke point, you are going to have an issue.  \n\nMerging from a 2-lane highway at 50 Mph to a single lane at 70Mph, the only cause of jamming is improper merging. \n\nHowever, without the speed changes, Merging from a near-capacity 2-lane to a single lane is going to cause a backup, zipper merge or not.  \nAt that point, attempting to merge late is only going to increase the number of breaking events.

The stopped cars then have to slowly accelerate until one is again cut off, repeating the cycle.   It's very simple really.\n\nWhen you're traveling on an open freeway, you can be in a lane with many other vehicles and all of you moving at a considerable rate of speed, 70mph, with even only a car length between you because no one is performing unsafe maneuvers, and this is speed you could travel through a single lane merge at if everyone got into the same lane early.  But if you're traveling at that 70mph with a single car length between you and the car in front of you, and someone cuts in front of you so there is only inches between you and them you have to immediately slow down.\n\nMerging suddenly can not be done at a decent speed by untrained drivers drivers, and not at all between drivers who don't know exactly what those they're merging with are going to do, so it's common sense to merge when you have to most time so you can do it safety, and that's early.  \n\nThe problem they haven't figured out well yet, through some states are trying: https://www.tn.gov/assets/entities/tdot/attachments/MergeLeftBroc.pdf, is how to keep assholes from abusing the system.", "id": "d2mwc84"}, {"comment": "> No, backups come from from drivers in the ending lane waiting until the last possible minute to merge into the continuing lane,\n\nWrong.\n\nOver the last several years, multiple state DOTs tried several different options, and they found one that works best: if *everyone* is forced to merge at the last minute, rather than merging early in random locations, then the flow speeds up significantly.   The Feds agree, and [FHA now recommends late-merge zipper as the best method.](http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop12012/sec2.htm#sec24)\n\nWhy does this work?  Because if a lane is ending, and both lanes are full right up to the last second, then no empty lane exists, so no \"cheaters.\"  And then, people in the through-lane stop tailgating to block out the merging vehicles in the ending lane.  Rather than \"punishing the cheaters,\" there are no cheaters, so they can open up spaces.   The flow increases by 5%-20%.\n\nIn other words, it was the lane-blockers doing it all along.  The jam was caused by tailgating.  The cheaters didn't force anyone to tailgate, it was an intentional act of attempted punishment.   And, the so-called \"cheaters\" were not cheating in the first place.  They were the only ones doing it right: staying in their lane and refusing to merge early.   The real problem was that so few drivers were doing this.\n\nWhen one of these enormous lane-end backups appears, adding lots more \"cheaters\" makes the flow increase, because it fills up the empty lane, and convinces the drivers in the through-lane that nobody has cheated, and so they quit all the road-rager lane-blocking vigilante stuff.\n\nhttp://www.dot.state.mn.us/zippermerge/\n\nhttp://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/07/the-beauty-of-zipper-merging-or-why-you-should-drive-ruder/\n\nhttp://lifehacker.com/the-right-way-to-merge-lanes-to-avoid-traffic-jams-and-1501148503\n\nhttps://www.cars.com/articles/2014/05/the-zipper-merge-convincing-motorists-isnt-a-snap/\n", "id": "d2mxc3n"}, {"comment": "You must not have read my post to the end, so I'll repeat this part for you:\n\n>The problem they haven't figured out well yet, through some states are trying: https://www.tn.gov/assets/entities/tdot/attachments/MergeLeftBroc.pdf, is **how to keep assholes from abusing the system**.\n\nThe zipper merge Can't be faster than a properly performed early merge, but just one Asswipe per couple dozen cars will fuck up a an early merge.

It's an unconscious agreement to drive at a speed which guarantees minimum safety.\n\nThe real magic is this:  if everyone would drive with 150ft between cars, then traffic would speed up to roughly 40MPH.   All by unconsious agreement.   This assumes that the traffic itself is the only bottleneck, and it's not from a red light that backs up traffic all the way up onto the interstate.\n\nThe hard data is the \"Funamental diagram\" of traffic flow.

Of course this is unavoidable when a road is nearing its carrying capacity. But generally speaking, the way to maximize throughput is to drive as fast as possible and take up as little space as possible (your car size + your 'buffer' areas), without causing a wreck of course. \n\nThe golden rule that should be taught everywhere: If there's ever someone directly behind you, and not someone directly in front of you, you are literally the cause of traffic.", "id": "d2ohgac"}, {"comment": "That analysis only works if everyone drives perfectly on sync, which isn't applicable until we have robot cars.

But it also represents pre-1990s traffic research, so it's based on fundamental ignorance.  This is clearly why he hates smartmotorist article.  Smartmotorist is correct, and he's not.  All the good stuff happened post-1980s, so most of his conclusions are wrong.\n\nBut first, some pre-1980s concepts:   \n\nWe don't go faster by \"going slower.\"  We go faster by FREAKING OPENING UP TWO-SECOND SPACES, which ends our dangerous 1/2-second packing between vehicles.  Opening up spaces will slide the highway's operating point away from the [low-flow end of the Fundamental Diagram] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_diagram_of_traffic_flow) and towards the peak, which makes the entire highway's flow increase.   Increased flow means that the backups shrink to nothing.   Or, at least they grow more slowly during each rush-hour.\n\nAnd yes, if the entire highway had 2sec gaps between cars, then we can't improve things.   But first stop and think.  2sec between cars means this: uncongested, bound or free flow, un-jammed, peak flow conditions.   Which of course is not the topic of *any* of these websites or conversations or flamewars.\n\nIn other words, if we all *try* to go faster, and assume that \"pushing ahead\" is a good idea, then we'll end up closing our gaps and following the next car at way less than 2sec.  And then we'll all end up going at 1 mph, creeping through a merge-jam, or sitting in the stopped part of stop/go traffic.  It's a type of \"clog in the doorway\" effect.  During a nightclub fire, everyone should just eliminate gaps between people and push ahead, right?  If it doesn't work, then PUSH EVEN HARDER.   What?  The flow halted entirely?   Well, it must be because we weren't pushing hard enough.  (Heh, well, traffic physics isn't exactly the same, but the Nightclub Fire Analogy is close. In congestion, the faster you *try* to drive, the slower you actually move.)\n\n> > But going slower isn't going to increase overall throughput; it's going to decrease it.\n\nWrong.\n\nWhen [the FHA instructs everyone \"go slow to go fast,\"](http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop12012/sec2.htm#sec24) it can't make any sense at all!  Unless?  Unless \"go slow\" has some other meaning than the obvious.\n\nThe phrase \"Go slow to go fast\" actually means \"stop your aggressive pushing-ahead.  Instead open up a several-second buffer area, eliminate all close-following tailgater behavior  ...and then like magic, the average speed of the whole highway increases.\"  So their phrase didn't have anything to do with \"go slow.\"   It was all about a different topic:  \"Far-following GOOOOOD,   close-following BAAAAAAAD.\"\n\nAlso, Yosemite Sam mudflaps.   BACK OFF.   If everyone maintains gaps of 2 seconds plus, then traffic speeds way up.  And as speeds increase, \"two seconds\" becomes 30ft, 50ft, 100ft, a big gap which could fit several merging cars.\n\nI say it like this:   if there one or two other cars can't merge ahead of you, then your gap is too small, and you're the prime cause of traffic jams: a habitual tailgater.\n\nFrom \"HOW TRAFFIC ACTUALLY WORKS\"\n\n>  Maybe you can eliminate the annoying stop-and-go, but no one gets home any faster.\n\nWrong.   Stop-go driving is genuinely slow on average, adding many minutes to your commute.   The \"go\" part of stop-go is a low flow, density too low.  The \"stop\" part is zero flow.   Worse, stop-and-go is an extremely major cause of accidents.  In experiments with pace-cars, eliminating the traffic-waves would almost eliminate the accidents.  Why did your commute take an hour longer than usual?   Accident being cleaned up.   Increasing the flow directly; that shortens your average trip-time much less than reducing the accident rate does.   Long-term yearly averages must include the delays from numerous accidents.\n\n> The important fact: there is a limit to the number of cars that can pass by a given point on the highway in a given amount of time, and that limit is one car every 2 seconds, per lane.\n\nYep, correct.   That's uncongested flow.   That's the ideal we want to strive for.\n\n> So imagine you are in heavy traffic during rush hour. \n\nBingo.   Heavy traffic during rush hour is UN-ideal.    It's deeply screwed up.  The flow rate is below 2000/hr maximum.  This author is pretending that rush hour is fast-flowing and unjammed, with big wide 2sec spaces between cars, where merging is easy.  Then he concludes that it's impossible to improve it?\n\n> It doesn\u2019t matter whether people are kind and let cars merge in front of them, zipper-style.\n\nWrong.  The \"zipper\" stuff increases the flow by ~15% long-term, directly contradicting his statement.  Also, the \"zipper\" reduces the accident rate.  This is mainly because it eliminates the huge speed-difference between a long clogged lane and the adjacent empty lane with so-called \"cheaters\" rushing down it.  It also eliminates most road-rage accidents.  After all, with two full lanes, nobody is zooming down any empty lane.\n\n> minimum of 2,000 seconds for you to get to the front of the line.\n\n\"Front of the line,\" he means your entire commute.   Yes, if traffic is already unjammed at ~40MPH, you can't shorten your commute.   Free flow at 40MPH is what we all wish we'd encounter everyday.   No sitting still.   No creeping forward at 2MPH on the highway, waiting to take your turn at the actual merge point.\n\n> Leaving space in front of your car for people who are trying to merge won\u2019t solve anything. \n\nWrong, it speeds the flow, roughly 15% in multiple experiments by DOTs.   It shaves minutes off a typical commute.   Over tens of thousands of cars, that's an enormous impact.    Besides, I thought we were all supposed to be leaving a 2sec gap in front of our cars!   Two seconds, that's more than enough for another car to merge ahead.  Maybe two or three.   At 10MPH, a 2-sec gap is 30ft from car to car.   At 30MPH it's 88ft.\n\n> Let\u2019s say you slow down to leave some room for an upcoming merge. Now you are 4 seconds behind the car in front of you instead of 2. You\u2019ve just added 2 seconds to the commute of everyone behind you in line. Now a car merges in front of you. At the next merge, you have to leave more space. That\u2019s another 2 seconds for everyone behind you.\n\nYes, that's called \"merging lanes.\"  His point appears to be, if we all tailgate, *refuse* to open up 2-second gaps, then the two lanes wouldn't be able to merge anymore.   And then, that would speed up traffic?   If not, then what?  If we close up spaces, then the evil intruding lane would be blocked forever?  And only our lane alone would go fast?  No?   If not, then what are we supposed to accomplish by driving at far less than 2sec gaps and blocking all merges?\n\nEliminating gaps, driving with less than 1/2sec between cars, that removes all fast \"gear teeth\" or \"zipper\" flows, and turns everything into a sort of 4-way stop sign where everyone creeps along, then takes turns.\n\n> This is basically the definition of a traffic jam.\n\nNo, it's the definition of an overloaded highway, where influx from two full lanes is overloading the single downstream lane.  The \"traffic jams\" discussed in all the contemporary research are something completely different.  On an overloaded highway, the downstream road is completely full and flowing fast, with the upstream merging roads all flowing proportionally slower.  That's extremely rare.  It's not the topic of these websites, research papers, forums, etc., etc.\n\nOverloaded highways look just like traffic jams to those approaching.  Yet in genuine traffic jams, the downstream highway is relatively empty.  It's operating at far less than 2000/hr flow.  More important, the same group of roads, with exactly the same total influx, can function in \"jammed state\" or in \"unjammed state.\"   Trigger a jam, and the flow rate drops, the outflow dries up as backups form upstream.   Un-trigger the jam and the outflow goes to max, and the backups drain away.  Ideally.\n\nTo discuss this topic, one must have a clear understanding of the terms \"congestion\" versus \"traffic jam.\"   If by driving differently we could remove all the jams, and the accidents they create, and their lower flows, then the congestion would of course remain.  If drivers would just bring 2-sec empty spaces into merge-zones, then traffic would speed up, even though two lanes would still have to merge into one.\n\nOur personal behavior behind the wheel can have an enormous effect on traffic jams.   But it has zero effect on congestion.\n", "id": "d2p14cj"}, {"comment": "> Smartmotorist is correct, and he's not.\n\nBy this, you mean \"I'm correct\"?

I agree that going slower will be faster if it's preventing accidents that otherwise would have occurred. But I still think it's dubious to get 15% greater throughput if there were no accidents in either scenario and would be interested in those experiments.", "id": "d2pbitt"}, {"comment": "> By this, you mean \"I'm correct\"?\n\nYep, me and the FHA and the various state DOTs and all the traffic engineers using Fundamental Diagram for the last seventy years, we're all saying the same thing.  Maintain big wide 2-sec spaces between cars.\n\nThe github article mentions this at first, but then spends the rest of the article fighting against it.   Very strange.   I assume that he's trying to defend some prior misconceptions about how traffic actually works.  That, or he doesn't realize that a 2-sec gap is actually the same \"enormous gap\" which he wants to get rid of.\n\n> > by leaving space in front of you, you\u2019re artificially reducing the occupancy of that part of the road,\n\nThat's wrong because he's focusing only on density, while completely ignoring the connection between speed and flow rate.   Bad mistake.  It distorts everything he talks about later.\n\nIf we pack more cars on the highway by removing the 2-sec gaps, then yes, there are more cars, so the flow rate should increase.  But when cars are spaced so closely, their speed decreases.  That's an opposite effect.  Which one wins, more cars or more speed?  Does adding more cars always increase the flow rate?  Nope.   In bound flow (commuter traffic, at speeds ~35MPH and below,) closing up gaps becomes a bad thing.   It *greatly* decreases the speed, which wipes out any gains achieved by adding more cars per mile.\n\nThat's where the fundamental diagram comes in.  Find the peak, the maximum flow, and also find the traffic speed and the traffic spacing for the peak conditions.  Then, increase the spacing and watch the flow decrease while the speed goes up.  Or, decrease the spacing and watch the flow decrease and the speed goes down.  The peak flow is the best behavior for drivers, by definition.\n\nBut instead believing \"we must jam more cars onto the highway, we must eliminate spaces,\" that's actually a recipe for huge rush-hour delays.   Carried to its limit, we end up with cars 6in apart, creeping along at 1/4MPH.  So, we have to open up spaces in that close-packed chain, but where can we put the cars, won't that make the jam worse?!!!!  Heh.  It just rubs our noses in the fact that an ideal traffic pattern must exist; a peak in the flow rate graph.\n\n> > but since you haven\u2019t changed the number of cars trying to use the road, this comes at the expense of increased occupancy somewhere else.\n\nThat's a bad misconception.   He's actually describing traffic waves, where if we start out with a smooth dense flow, we can significantly *reduce* the flow rate by opening up wide spaces in one place while closing up all the gaps in another.   Yes, this is a bad thing.  \n\nBut it's not a description of taking some extremely dense congestion, then increasing the flow by adding gaps between the cars.\n\n> > Sure, there\u2019s a beautiful line of cars behind you driving at a constant 35 mph, but behind that there\u2019s a ridiculous traffic jam that didn\u2019t need to be there.\n\nNope, doesn't happen.   He's making s**t up.    How can driving at the average speed \"cause a ridiculous traffic jam\" to appear behind you?   It looks like he's trapped in an irrational belief that, in order to smooth the traffic waves, we must drive slowly.   Nope, wrong.  There's no need to slow down.  We just have to stop participating in the jackrabbiting-then-halting behavior.  Instead drive at their same average speed.   He also seems convinced that, when traffic waves appear, the average speed and flow never changes.  Nope, wrong, it always decreases.  By what amount?   I've only seen simulation results:  5% to 30% decrease.  So, keeping the waves from appearing is certainly not a useless task.\n\nHeh, that beautiful line of 35MPH cars, *that itself* is the ridiculous jam that he's angry about.\n\n> But if everyone is leaving 150 ft in front of their car, then unless the highway is almost completely empty, you're very quickly reaching capacity\n\nHold on.  The \"capacity\" concept does not involve the density of cars as you say here.  It's all about FLOW RATE.   If everyone maintains 150ft spacing, and they're all going 40, then that's a very high flow rate; probably at the peak of the graph.  In that case, closing up gaps will screw things up.  So will opening up wider gaps.\n\n> Otherwise, most of your & the DOT argument seems to be based on prevention of accidents\n\nDOT argument?   No, DOT experimental results.   They find that, for example late merging will increase the average flow by 15%.   The github article pointedly insists that this cannot happen.   He's just wrong.   Don't listen to speculation about how things work, instead do like Faraday, and \"let the experiment be made.\"\n\nYes, the reduction of accidents is a larger effect.   But that cannot alter the fact that turning a \"conventional merge\" into a \"zipper\" will actually increase the flow significantly.\n\n> But I still think it's dubious to get 15% greater throughput if there were no accidents in either scenario and would be interested in those experiments.\n\nWhy dubious?  Don't adopt opinions before examining the research.  For special \"late merge\" signage, [this one gives a number 20% increased flow](https://www.codot.gov/library/traffic/lane-close-work-zone-safety/work-zone-traffic-operations/travel-demand-management/late-merge-work-zone-traffic-control-strategy/LateMergeWorkZoneTrafficControlStrategyOverview.pdf).pdf.  [This one is where I found that 15% value.](http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/workshops/accessible/McCoy.htm) \n\nTo search with Google Scholar, find a very old paper, then display the citations and look at all the later papers.\n\nHeh, when I first started this back in late 1990s, I was hoping that wide-spaces-late-merging might double the flow rate.   Nope.  It just increases it by 15%, or 20%.\n\nAnd again, the github article is wrong in insisting that this improvement has to be zero, and that we shouldn't even bother trying.  His speculative reasoning is trying to contradict the results of multiple experiments.   If he could remove the mistakes in his reasoning, then he would be *predicting* the same improvements.   Traffic is counterintuitive.

The \"more cars\" bit has to be taken as a *given*, not an option. You either make room for more cars by spacing them closer together, or else they will slow down to get their 'ideal' spacing causing the congestion to extend further back down the highway where it wasn't congested before. And if that congestion starts to affect people who were going to exit in a few miles before hitting the worse congested area, it unnecessarily worsens the flow.\n\nYes, less spacing will cause people to naturally slow down, but there can be benefits if it minimizes the total area which is congested.\n\n> Why dubious?

Whether or not I think such policy's were for the good of the nation is another matter, but I'm not acting like the other side doesn't also have legitimate reasons for feeling/thinking the way they do.\n\nDeclarations, be they of secession or independence, are great for conveying the authors perception (since you are for some reason uncomfortable with the [first definition of the other phrase](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sentiment)) but not much else.\nTheir function is to help legitimize this extreme political act in the eyes of both the old and new governing body. This means they generally try to describe their cause in the noblest possible terms and characterize their treatment by the old country as straight tyranny with no chaser.\n\n\nIn all my schoolin and independent research I've yet to come across evidence that these things happened, much less as you've characterized them.

But the only way I'm going to do that is through a substantive argument backed up by meaningful evidence.

They apparently intended to kill anyone opposed to them, seize supplies, and escape into Mexico. One slave leader escaped, but two were hanged and the other participants whipped. Anglos drove out of the county several Mexicans and one Anglo accused of aiding the would-be rebels. Whites in Lavac, De Witt and Victoria counties believed they uncovered during November a similar plan in which killing all dogs in the are represented the first step. A man from Ohio named Davidson received a hundred lashes as one of three whites accused of being abolitionists connected with the revolt. \n\nTexas also had issues with Mexico stretching decades previous (such as the [Anahuac Disturbance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anahuac_Disturbances) which led to Texas' revolt from Mexico), for some extended period of which they petitioned the Federal government for aid and assistance, which almost entirely found refusal. This too they complain about in their declaration.\n\nBut overall, let's also keep in mind that Texas (and other states that provided declarations) *left the union and went to war* over these announced grievances. It's not as if they drafted their declaration in vacuum, empty of the issues it describes, or as wholesale liars and fabricators of the situation they quite reasonably believed to be experiencing.

I'll just give my two cents on the places where I don't.\n\n>Fitness-club style contracts to lock in a year or more of membership up front.\n\nYes and no.  One of the things my teacher has told me in the past is that his experience is that people who aren't willing to sign up for a set time period aren't willing to commit and don't stick around.  That said, he'll stop someone's contract if they can't come for some reason (e.g. injury, they lose their job, move out of the area, etc.).  I understand your misgivings (I shared them before finding my current teacher), but in my case at least I'm willing to defer to my own teacher's experience.\n\n>Anywhere that charges more than $100/month. Martial arts instruction isn't something where the more expensive it is, the better it is. \n\nI disagree with the amount cut-off.  I pay more than this (although not by a lot), and there are plenty of places in town that are more than what I pay for less training time.  That said, I agree with what you said about price and quality not automatically being correlated.\n\nOne thing to consider is whether your teacher is full-time.  Mine is, so I think it's fair to pay more to allow him to do that.  It means he trains a ton with his own teacher and on his own, and spends additional time thinking about how to make us all better.\n\n>No big egos. This is a biggie for me.

After a certain point you're just going to have to take it on faith, but I think these things will improve your chances.\n\n1.  I for one will never train anywhere that has belts.\n\n2.  Do they compete?  If so, unless competition is all you want to do, go someplace that doesn't.  Even if they claim they teach self defense too, they'll consciously or not include the things you \"can't\" do in the ring in what they teach, which could be dangerous in a real-life situation.  Plus, competing is very much an ego exercise, which to me is not compatible with good training and teaching.  Those who have it don't need to prove that they do, and those of us still learning know that we still have a ways to go.\n\n3.  What's the main teacher's relationship with his teacher like?  How long did he train?  If a guy trained with someone for 2 years and then never talked to them again, how much can he really teach you?  If he's cut off ties with his teacher, that potentially says there's some shittiness on his part, his teacher's or both.  Be wary.\n\n4.  I personally do not believe in mixing arts.  I think that if someone needs to add another art to compensate for something, it either means the art itself isn't complete or, more likely, their knowledge of it isn't.  I realize a lot of people disagree with this though.\n\n5.  How aggressively do they advertise?  Good schools have a reasonable presence without getting too in your face.  They know they have something worthwhile to offer, and while it's fine to say \"this is what we're about, and this is why we're a good place to train,\" I'd be skeptical of anything that felt too interested in selling you.  It's a balance.\n\n5.  Overall environment.  Like others have said, if a place just feels bad it won't be a good place to train and you won't stick with it.  I want someplace that will push me to push myself, but not someplace run by people who've seen *Full Metal Jacket* one too many times.  I actually ended up at my current school after a muai thai gym showed they had no interest in teaching someone who couldn't get in a ring and make the school look good.  Plus, if it feels like it's a cash grab, it probably is.\n\n6.  Ask questions.  A teacher should be able to explain why they do x, or what their overall philosophy is.  As long as you're not a douche about it, I don't think a good teacher will have a problem with this.  They may not always be able to answer in a way that makes sense, since sometimes the answer takes some background in the art to see.  But I think you can usually tell if the person doesn't know what they're talking about.  An exception to this is if you're talking to someone with less training time than the head teacher; there, you want them to say they don't know.  That to me says they know what they don't know and aren't afraid of acknowledging it, and says the head teacher instills good values in his/her students.\n\n7.  What's the lineage or pedigree?  I personally am super skeptical of any art that claims to be a renewal of a lost art (like ninjitsu/ninjutsu or some generic \"Shaolin\" art) or is something some guy recently made up.  For plenty of martial arts, an individual school's lineage may be based on oral histories, which may or may not be accurate (and sometimes deliberately hide things), but if it's an art that's survived for a long time that's a good sign.  For something newer, do you really want to be the guinea pig?  (This isn't to say some newer arts like Krav Maga or Sistema are per se illegitimate, of course.)\n\n8.  Are there any (chronologically) older people in the class who can do it well?  One of my issues with the \"harder\" arts like muai thai is how hard it is on the body.  It's tough to do that stuff into old age, and I for one don't want to be broken down and barely able to walk by the time I'm 50.  By way of contrast: I worked out with a guy last weekend who was easily 70 years old with two artificial hips and a rebuilt knee.  I'm 33, 6'5\" and about 240 pounds.  I may as well not have been there for all the effectiveness I had in stopping him from coming through me.  (Aside: it was *awesome.*)  This doesn't necessarily speak to the quality of the school, but is something I would consider.\n\n9.  How do they treat female students?  Let's face it, most people who do martial arts are guys.  If a woman trains, does she get coddled?  Stay away from someplace that encourages this (some guys may do it unconsciously because of cultural conditioning).  It's condescending, and is doing a disservice to the woman in question by not giving her realistic training.  Plus, to me it says the teacher doesn't trust the art if he thinks a female student can't use it effectively.  In addition to the older guy above, I have gotten my ass kicked in class by women half my size.\n\nSadly there's a lot of crap out there.  There's generally nothing stopping someone from training someplace for a year or two and then going and opening up a school somewhere.  But I'd like to think that the things I suggested will help weed out the obvious scams.  People can get very easily get into dick-measuring contests when it comes to this stuff, so it can be hard to talk about reasonably.  I believe very strongly in what I train, and that of course influences what I'd look for in a school.  My way isn't necessarily the only one, but I think it's broadly applicable.\n\nGood luck, and no matter what you decide to do, train hard.", "id": "d2un2b1"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d2unoz0"}, {"comment": "Yeah that's a fair consideration.

Take for example this quote from Paul Robeson, a Black folk singer, socialist, and leader in the Civil Rights Movement: \n\n\"*In Russia, I felt for the first time like a full human being.

It's bad history and borderline racist as well, because the theory only works with the underlying assumption that Black people were okay with their situation and would not have organized for their own liberation without being somehow tricked by infiltrators. This in turn plays on old stereotypes dating back to slavery that portray Black people as complacent, unintelligent and easily manipulated, and at peace with their supposed natural inferiority. The reality is that Black Americans organized and revolted in the 1960s and 70s because they were oppressed, and that is generally what oppressed people do.\n\nMy main source for this is Max Elbaum's *Revolution in the Air: Sixties Radicals Turn to Lenin, Mao and Che* (a fantastic read that I highly recommend).

What I'm saying is that, when people point out what they see as cultural Marxism, regardless of what they mean precisely (conspiracy or not), there may be some truth to the fact that Frankfurt School theorists provided the groundwork from which the new left built up it's anti-western ideology.

After all, we ought to give an account of how the anti-free speech movement (SJWs) came about, as this is one of the most fundamental values within western culture. Indeed, it is not simply blind chance that these same people call themselves Marxists, socialists, and communists. Perhaps this arises from their failure to distinguish Marxism in its original (historical materialism, revolution, etc.) form from the role it played in for the Frankfurt School\u2014a tool for criticizing capitalism and for finding a way of preserving the best parts of the Enlightenment, like free speech and the scientific method, without recreating the horrors of the 20th century.", "id": "dav7lo7"}, {"comment": "I get what you're saying..\n\nThe thing is, you'r right when you're saying that if you discard the core meaning, you can find a chain of logic supporting the claim that this is where SJWs originate.\n\nBut with this methodology, you could ascribe SJWs to any theory or even school of moral thought.\n\nTaboos are present in basically every single one of them up until the enlightenment (and every single reactionary philosophy), which is why it's paradoxical to assign the SJW movement to the Frankfurt school.\n\nI think it's much less about what the Frankfurt school actually was, and much more about what could reasonably be sold to that particular American audience.\n\nSince there's nothing a god-fearin red-blooded 'murrican hates more than ungrateful godless european pantsyass-commies, this is the angle that was chosen.", "id": "dav8aax"}, {"comment": "> But with this methodology, you could ascribe SJWs to any theory or even school of moral thought.\n\nNot quite. The school of thought or theory has to be obscure enough, vague enough, and complex enough to be misappropriated for such means. You could not, for instance, do this with the moral philosophy of Kant, who considered freedom of speech and truth as the highest of values. The point of my original comment was to suggest that there is a specific root of the SJW ideology and that it is not arbitrary. The texts within Critical Theory are notoriously unclear, vague, and complex. They are also just obscure enough that most people who are concerned about social justice will not have read them but will know roughly that their theories were based on Marxism, were highly critical of capitalism and conservatism, were overtly feminist, and were about social change and emancipation at the individual level. Taken all together you have a perfect recipe for an ideology that puts the onus on socially-minded individuals who are dissatisfied with the \"system\" to take it down by whatever means necessary.

On technicals, The Bible can be extremely interesting. The way people put faith in it is by believing it carries a very accurate image of God, and thus they read it trustingly (projective identification) or by impressing personal and cultural assumptions onto the work. Over eons, this practice creates traditions that actually shape culture and language itself, and thus causes us not to understand what The Bible is saying. \n\nThis isn't an issue of literalism verses symbolism, but of where euphemism is being used and where information has been fudged.\n \nFor example, when Lot's wife turns to \"a pillar of salt\", this could easily be understood (from the context of the story, language, and so on) not as a miraculous curse, but a euphemism saying that she \"turned white as a ghost\" and died where she stood from terror. This would explain why God said not to look back. Readers who desired to learn about God inferred it was a moral lesson to listen to God when they ran into what they didn't understand, rather than a simple ancient euphemism meant to more vividly describe a climactic scene in the story.\n\nThe same with God saying \"I will harden Pharaoh's heart\" in Exodus, which spawned entire theologies and theories on divine morality and predestination, when the meaning is also euphemistic liken to \"I will piss Pharaoh off\". Written today and read thousands of years from now, people might believe God deactivated Pharaoh's ability to pee for some reason. I'm not being facetious, this is a huge hurdle to understanding The Bible and it pertains to this problem.\n\nReading The Bible as literature is therefore very taboo and difficult, and understanding it as history (or having been taken as history) requires an understanding of each book's timeframe, culture, language, even attitudes.\n\nSo you might think that the Golden Calf was worshipped instead of God. Knowing that the Israelites were said to have left Egypt, and knowing ancient Egypt, you'd understand that the Golden Calf was meant to be a new Apis; a bull that would ferry praises to heaven for God. A divine bull is needed to carry the weight of so many praises, and the new Yahweh would need a new calf. Why would Yahweh be mad at this? Possibly because Moses found him in an abandoned Midianite shrine, and to be taken as \"new\" when you're the ancient Creator who was forgotten by his people and relegated to a Midianite shrine is pretty bad. They were to understand that Yahweh had come back from them, and was near to them.\n\nYet modern believers don't even know the significance of the shrine's location, or even note it, or even note that it's an abandoned shrine (Moses doesn't even notice it, is told by the lonely god to remove his sandals, \"holy ground\", there is a shrub, etc.).\n\nSo to that end, Exodus 2:10 says something like this:\n\n>*The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, \"Because I drew him out of the water.\"*\n\nWhich is another example of hidden information. For one, the Pharaoh's daughter wouldn't be speaking Hebrew or naming the child she saved and planned to raise as an Egyptian a Hebrew name. Second, \"Moses\" is Egyptian for \"son of\". Ramses is literally Ra-moses, or \"son of Ra\", Thutmose or Thutmosis is \"Son of Thut\". So \"Moses\" would have been son of the river goddess, because he was drawn out of the water, and he would have later became \"Moses\" when disavowing his Egyptian identity. Obvious to ancient readers, and lost on readers for literally thousands of years--his actual name perhaps edited out.\n\nI told you all this to put a taste in your mouth concerning your question.\n\nThese could be longevity myths. They could also be an ancient translation issue.

David made major reforms, actually extreme reforms to the Yahwist cult, unifying it, generalizing it, and centralizing worship in Jerusalem from Shiloh, and tying the spiritual fate of Israel (as a people holy to a god, like Muslims to Allah) to the fate of his divine monarchy. Although the king and not a Levite priest, David was declared (possibly by himself) as \"a man after God's own heart\", not only higher than the highest of priests, but actually sharing a heart like God's. Basically that meant he could speak directly for Yahweh. He was a god-king in a sort of roundabout way because he was God's favorite by his own self-concept, and his Psalms are still combed to this day for esoteric secrets as though they're God's own words (I mean capital-G God, as in, the entire idea of monotheism was taken by the haunches and still resembles David to this day).\n\nSo illustrious was David's story that his later sins, namely the deception and murder of Uriah so as to steal his wife, didn't tarnish his reputation as a divine lightning rod.\n\nNeedless to say David's rumor of being Yahweh's chosen king has been unfathomably successful, despite previous attitudes that Yahweh forbade any king or worship or fear or veneration of anything besides himself. Indeed Jesus' own popularity is on confidence in David's words as being like God's own words, over two billion strong to this day in the shadow of David.\n\nI digress. I just wanted to highlight David so you understand the dramatic ocean of events that the Ark sank to the bottom of.\n\nSo previously, before Davidic unification and reforms, if the people were sinning and worshipping Ba'al or sacrificing children or denying the commandments, they'd be understood as cursed by God for breaking the covenant (contract). Any misfortune would be attributed to their sins. After David, if the monarchy sinned or the king was evil, then Israel suffered punishment. From this spawned Messianicism, or the idea that David would resurrect (he believed he would and would rule forever) or that God would fashion for himself a holy representative on earth to rule.\n\nSo as these clouds collected over Israel and the cult was becoming imperial, Solomon built the Temple in Jerusalem (which ended the use of local village and family shrines to Yahweh), and as you're probably already sensing, the focus was quickly shifting away from the diverse and freestyle traditional Yahwisms of the frontier, and from the Ark and its purpose: It's contents, the agreement between God and man, the Ten Commandments.\n\nOr seven, or five, or eight, unless they're produced and proven to exist, you can't really know. That's the point of them: As evidence of a covenant and what God expects, written in stone so they cannot be tampered with or subtracted from or added to. The commandments presume mistrust, opposite of the faith (literally: trust) in priests and sacred books we have today. The commandments were said to be in stone because they were understood by ancient Yahwists to be the entirety of the agreement.\n\nAnyway that line began to blur, and by the Second Temple period, the Temple itself no longer contained the Ark for which the Temple was originally built, but was just a worship center to Yahweh. The land itself and Jerusalem became more and more sacred and where Yahweh was said to be located. The idea that the Temple Mount is particularly sacred is from this tradition. Technically the Third Temple could be built in Shiloh, or really anywhere so long as it has the Ark. Moreover the Temple mount is pointless without the Ark.\n\nSo guess where the Ark probably is.\n\nActually the Rabbis do know where it is, or say they do, as some extremely high ranking Rabbis have claimed to have seen it. This is [The Temple Institute](https://www.templeinstitute.org/ark_of_the_covenant.htm), currently training Third Temple priests, making the temple vassels and furniture, ephods and alike, as well as breeding previously-extinct red heifers for sacrifice, and have acquired a giant golden menorah to the tune of $3,000,000. These guys are serious, located in Jerusalem, and aren't fringe weirdos in the religious Jewish community.

Because it seems people run wild with this, it's all over late night conspiracy talk radio I used to listen to on my way home at 11-2 AM from a lousy job.\n\nWell, seeing it as the \"end of times\" is a decision on the part of folks who've taken to the theory that there will be, should be, or that The Bible is a single continuous unit that can altogether indicate a great ending of one age and beginning of a new age in which social evil is vanquished and mankind lives in harmony. People still die in said world, but they live to be as old as cedar trees and things of that nature. These authors believe that Israel will be the capital of said utopia, that it'll happen by miraculous conquest, and tend to think God will have a direct hand in it (rather than it being done by human endeavor or occurring gradually, or it being impossible, etc.). In all of these utopian views, Israel is always proven right and are the most blessed, the nations are all very sorry for having quarreled with them and oppressed them (Israel isn't sorry for any of its quarreling because they answer to God, and so they're already punished for their sins by the time utopia occurs).\n\nThe end of the world apocalypse is a Christian view, which factors in Jesus coming on the clouds and vanquishing demonic human and supernatural powers forever. The Christian view turns the future itself into the afterlife, in which the new world that Jesus creates is also the Christian heaven and is very supernatural. The curse of Adam is totally broken in the Christian narrative so that people not only don't die, but the dead rise again into eternal glory or torture. The Jewish prophets have a resurrection also (like Ezekiel), but it's usually so that those Israelites who died for or because of the cause can still enjoy the terrestrial spoils. They're not depicted as immortal.\n\nSo yeah, there are multiple ways Ezekiel was viewed in history and today.\n\n>Is Gog a real thing? A future group? I still don't really understand.\n\nGog is a geographical area and people. It's generally understood as Russia.\n\n>Or was Ezekiel alluding to peoples of the time it was written?\n\nHe was.\n\n>Is it totally all meant to be prophecy? Is all Ezekiel all totally meant to be prophecy?\n\nGenerally speaking, the Hebrew scriptures don't contain prophecy as we understand it. I say \"generally speaking\" because the ancients found technicalities and roundabout ways to do things they shouldn't do. I'll give you a modern example.\n\nSo believers in Abrahamic faiths know that they're not allowed to have an image of God of any kind whatsoever. That if you form anything in the image of God and call it holy, worship it, fear it, revere it, trust it, ascribe to it divine qualities of perfection and things, that's idolatry. You cannot represent any image of God in any way, and so no object can be especially elevated as divine or divine-like. This is well known.\n\nOn the other hand, Abrahamic faiths all have a book (Bible, Quran, Tanakh/Talmud), and the *literary* image of God is called so perfect and accurate that if you don't believe that's what he looks like in the abstract sense, then you deny God by proxy and your destiny is at stake. Temptations of eternal life and blessing exist for those who confess the images of the books are correct likenesses of God, and the only reason these cults aren't brothers under Abraham's god is because they have different books--different depictions of him. \n\nNow if any other group was acting this way regarding pictures or statues, then all the Abrahamic faiths would call them idolaters with one voice. Yet they themselves can effectively venerate idols all day long, even suggest that their books are holy and blessed and perfect and essentially godlike, without conscience. So these anti-iconoclastic faiths have functioning idols, even though they don't believe that they have idols in their own opinion of themselves, by complex reasoning as to what counts and doesn't count. Usually this reasoning is circular and references boundaries set by assuming the idol.\n\nEzekiel similarly toes those waters concerning prophecy. Prophecy (divining) is forbidden in the Torah (ancient books of spiritual law); you aren't allowed to seek visions of the future or invoke gods to do so. So prophets didn't seek divine fortune telling; rather, God always appears to them, often against their will, and volunteer the information. That's dodge number one. Dodge number two is, that God doesn't give future prophecies in the Tanakh so much as an ultimatum of two possible futures, if the Jews do right or do wrong. This is justified by having a contract with God, a covenant. Therefore (by the reasoning within the Tanakh framework) God can issue these ultimatums because the covenant is being trespassed and it renders him within his rights to strike. This is why most prophecies aren't seen like divining.\n\nEzekiel is more provocative still. In Ezekiel 2, God issues his warning, but he also foresees that Israel wont listen, so he fails to tell them they have an option to repent and the benefits of repenting, and basically says what'll happen by saying how the Israelites wouldn't repent anyway. You can see how this is more like fortune telling. A religious Jew or ancient Yahwist would argue that it doesn't count because God would be within his right to say what he's going to do (and, therefore, the future) on account of the covenant being transgressed.\n\nAnd so you can see how the Biblical prophets got around some of the boundaries and implications of pure monotheism by way of the covenant and inter-framework reasoning.\n\nSo to answer your question: Was Ezekiel prophesying in the Christian sense, as in, divining?

I argued that in the Sinai story the Israelites built an calf Apis to Yahweh. Historical Ancient Egypt is the contextual backdrop of that story whether you believe it happened or not.\n\n>so, while egypt was hugely influential, we should be looking at canaanite mythology more closely that egyptian. is there a bull in canaanite mythology?\n\nYep. No calf, though. I'm not sure why in the context of the story why they'd be representing El as a calf and not a bull, or why Yahweh would be mad.\n\nAfter all, Yahweh hadn't given his commandments yet and had presented himself as \"the God of the fathers\" numerous times, so why is he punishing the Hebrews for ordinary idolatry when it'd not yet been prohibited?\n\nIt was a calf in the tradition of Apis.\n\nAlso the story would have said it had it been a tribute to El because then the point of the story wouldn't have been that the Israelites had sinned, but to tell the story of how Yahweh defeated El.\n\n>so the bull is a symbol that canaanites would have associated with a god synonymous with el. this makes perfect sense.\n\nThat's not how information works. Perfection is a sign of a perceptual issue. Reality is nuanced, so a perfect answer is a sign of answering the wrong question; one's own question. In this case: Who was the bull god? You're assuming the calf was a bull and a god, and assuming it has nothing to do with Egypt despite the Exodus being about rejecting Egypt and embracing Yahweh, because you think that because the Exodus didn't happen, the story context doesn't matter.\n\nI think your resolution on this subject isn't very high, and that you're seeing what you want in the blur. That's my opinion.\n\n>it's likely that yahweh was originally a local storm deity in midian, essentially their version of baal hadad.\n\nOkay so you're saying that the Exodus is right on Yahweh's legendary origin (one forgotten fledgling shrine in Midian) but wrong about Israel's (an Exodus from Egypt) when both are equally absurd. What's with this bias? Why shouldn't you believe that Yahweh was a later Israelite invention? A combination of local tribal gods into one super-god that emerged over time in Israel, like Allah in Arabia? Why accept Yahweh's legendary origin? And only half of it no less.\n\nYeah, half. After all, the story doesn't say that Yahweh was from Midian, but suggests that his *last shrine* was in Midian. This is meant to be shocking, that even the Midianites were more loyal to Yahweh than Israel. Remember, he presents himself to Moses as from Canaan as \"the god of the fathers\". I think you didn't catch that because you don't know what you're looking at. \n\nIf I may speak freely, I think you're saying Yahweh was from Midian just to be facetious towards Abrahamic faith, which is popular online. I get that impression because you argued against the Exodus when I didn't argue for it. I think you want a spiritual debate and to walk all over a believer, and are seeing beliefs where I'm not being absolute (like saying the calf is an Apis, which you're taking as an endorsement of the Exodus rather than a reflection on the context).\n\nThis isn't a spiritual conversation. Not for me at least.\n\n>edom has a god named qos that seems to be identical to yahweh. and i mean, identical, such that even the biblical authors never condemn or even mention qos, but welcome edomites.\n\nEdom is repeatedly blasted by South Kingdom prophets, in Yahweh's name, as they found any reason to make war with Edom.\n\nFor those wondering, Edom was a mountain country south of Judah, the southmost tribe of Israel, extremely rich in copper ore and a geographical fortress. When the civil war broke out and the North Kingdom of Israel and South Kingdom of Judah (which absorbed local tribes) raged, Judah wished to seize Edom. Since a divine covenant of eternal brotherhood and non-trespass existed, South Kingdom prophets raged against Edom to say that Yahweh is now mad at them and changed his mind.\n\nBack to /u/arachnophilia, you're wrong. Huge portions of Obadiah and Amos and (I believe) Nehemiah are dedicated to heralding their destruction in God's name, thus ending their previously eternal covenant of protection and brotherhood that you're referencing from Deuteronomy.\n\n>the only historical reference we have to, possibly yahweh, is in the name of a tribe of nomads from midian. this story, though a fiction, could reflect a partial truth and cultural memory that yahwism was midianite.\n\nEdom =/= Midian. Different periods, different locale emphasis. Suggesting that Edomites and Midianites are the same is like saying that people from Tennessee are the historic Cherokee.\n\n>\"moshe\" is hebrew for \"drawn\", as you'd draw water.\n\nThis is because of Exodus. Moshe isn't a native Hebrew word. I explained this, how The Bible retroactively affects history and language.\n\n>doesn't fit; people in the genealogies are having sons at 30. this is a huge problem if we have to divide by 12. or even 4. or 2.\n\nYou mean it doesn't *always* fit. Always is a pretty bad barometer for a library of books written over such vast timescales. It's good to keep an open mind instead of just saying, \"Yep, Sumerians liked longevity myths for early mythical kings so Methuselah, who wasn't a mythical king or from Sumeria, must be like that.\" That's not how you get to the bottom of a question or quirk. that's starting with your conclusion and working backwards.\n\nSeeing that you started by suggesting I was saying Exodus is historical, and because you said Yahweh was from Midian [apparently] just to divorce his origin from Israel, I think you're just trying to discredit the Israelite story. I'm not saying they were right, but I'm saying your information just seems to be contrarian to certain belief structures, not interested in the historical quirks or questions.\n\nI can see and agree with the logic of understanding the Biblical ages as longevity myths as a starting point to find out what they are, but I think you're just too eager to pass them off as ordinary and will miss any opportunity to miss any of the nuances of their culture. I mean, you even suggested that Edomites were Midianites, and thought that the existence of Edom's Qos is actually a ding to Yahweh's credibility because it is to you (because Yahweh is typical, then) when the Israelites would have understood it as an endorsement of Yahweh by a different tongue. If you say you have a dog, and a Chinese person says they own a g\u01d2u, do you suddenly think dogs are *less* real? That's just not how they thought.

Historical Ancient Egypt is the contextual backdrop of that story whether you believe it happened or not.\n\nwhat i was trying to establish here was that it's only the contextual backdrop *within* the narrative. looking *outside* the narrative to egypt for explanatory power is problematic at best, because *historically* the narrative was written in a period where egypt was no longer the dominant power in the region, and by people who had never particularly been under egyptian rule.\n\nthere may well be *some* egyptian influence, however. for instance, we still see pseudo-egyptian iconography on the bullae of first temple judean kings like hezekiah. but it seems like they're mostly just invoking symbols that had come to represent political power, and weren't especially familiar with egyptian religion.\n\nif the authors *had* been more familiar with canaanite/egyptian interactions, they might have chosen a different candidate for the idol. the hyksos conflated their gods with the local egyptian gods, and their primary deity baal already features strongly in the biblical narrative. in egypt, baal was the god set: a desert and storm god. given that yahweh exhibits many qualities of a storm god, this confusion would have been way more natural (and the reason there is constant struggle with baal cults in the bible).\n\n> Yep. No calf, though. I'm not sure why in the context of the story why they'd be representing El as a calf and not a bull, ...\n\nthere's some degree of cultural variation here. regardless, this story isn't so much about some actual historical event that happened wandering in the sinai desert; it's about a (probably) actual historical event that happened in bethel and dan during the first temple period. and there is little doubt that those calves were idols to el. the E source in the torah is a northern israelite document, and it calls god \"el\" for half of it. we're told in the later and more historical books of the bible (eg: kings) that the northern kingdom had a close association with other canaanite city-states, and allowed baal worship for a lot of its history. some of this is probably retrojection, sure, but the point is that this model all fits together, with israel being very similar to other canaanite cultures in the structure of their pantheon.\n\n> ... or why Yahweh would be mad. After all, Yahweh hadn't given his commandments yet and had presented himself as \"the God of the fathers\" numerous times, so why is he punishing the Hebrews for ordinary idolatry when it'd not yet been prohibited?\n\nwhy is yahweh mad about baal worship? they are practically the same god, and share tons of mythology. i think the answer is that you have to look at the cultural and historical context. this is a *cultural polemic*, not a statement about a real god who really does things that always make sense (indeed, he's often quite irrational in J and sometimes in E). rather, this is condemning the northern kingdom for their splitting and adapting the religion in a way the southern levites didn't quite like. think something like catholic schisms, or the condemnation of various heretical christologies. they're *pretty* similar, so why would god be mad that it's not *exactly* orthodox?\n\n> Also the story would have said it had it been a tribute to El because then the point of the story wouldn't have been that the Israelites had sinned, but to tell the story of how Yahweh defeated El.\n\nby this point, yahweh and el are synonymous. they just don't like the other cultures' version of el, and don't like the bull. (their yahweh/el sits, instead, on *winged, human headed* bulls, shedu/kerubim)\n\n>  In this case: Who was the bull god? You're assuming the calf was a bull and a god, and assuming it has nothing to do with Egypt despite the Exodus being about rejecting Egypt and embracing Yahweh, because you think that because the Exodus didn't happen, the story context doesn't matter.\n\ni think the context contemporaneous to the author matters more than the fictional contexts of the story in this case, yes. and i think the bull is a plot device. ancient near eastern people didn't tend to worship actual objects; the idea that these people are worshiping a physical object is a misrepresentation by the author, to diminish the idea that the god it represents is actually real. there are plenty of similar non-worshiped cultic objects in judean belief, like the kerubim. (it's not *exactly* the same, but think of catholics and crucifixes; they don't worship the piece of wood.)\n\n> Okay so you're saying that the Exodus is right on Yahweh's legendary origin (one forgotten fledgling shrine in Midian) but wrong about Israel's (an Exodus from Egypt) when both are equally absurd. \n\nno; both may be wildly distorted cultural memories. the exodus may be influenced by things like the hyksos expulsion, and the retreat of egypt from canaan about 500 years later. placing jethro in midian might be an indication that ancient israelites though yahweh worship started there.\n\n> What's with this bias? Why shouldn't you believe that Yahweh was a later Israelite invention? \n\nas far as i'm concerned, the yahweh that we know is actually an invention of the author(s) of the J source, perhaps adapting some older traditions, but in J he strikes me as a fundamentally new and different character with a strong authorial characterization. i'm not actually sure that yahweh was *ever* worshiped in israel/samaria aside from whichever group wrote the E source. (i'm not even convinced that yahwism was the predominant cult in judah until after the exile.) i was merely trying to present the current midianite/kenite hypothesis, proposed in academic circles. personally, i don't entirely buy it, in part because the egyptian source that records \"shasu of yahu\" doesn't seem to regard the name \"yahu\" as belonging to a deity.\n\n> If I may speak freely, I think you're saying Yahweh was from Midian just to be facetious towards Abrahamic faith, which is popular online.\n\nnot at all -- this is actually one of the leading academic hypotheses on the subject. frankly, we *just don't know* where yahweh came from, this is the current best guess. and as i said, i don't *entirely* buy it yet.\n\nin fact, i spend plenty of time blasting people, even on the academic subreddits, who perpetuate certain kinds of misinformation against the abrahamic faiths. for instance, i argue down the \"yahweh was a war god\" business every time i hear it, i frequently argue against christ-mythicists, and i just plain *laugh at* the followers of murdock/zeitgeist that propose ridiculously false parallels.\n\nin any case, here's [a good blog post](https://isthatinthebible.wordpress.com/2016/02/05/the-origins-of-yahweh-and-the-revived-kenite-hypothesis/) written by a member of /r/academicbiblical and a [more scholarly article on the subject](http://bibliotecadigital.uca.edu.ar/repositorio/revistas/toward-new-synthesis-god-edom.pdf)\n\n> Edom is repeatedly blasted by South Kingdom prophets, in Yahweh's name, as they found any reason to make war with Edom.\n\nthe prophets blasted everyone, including their own kingdom, though. it's kind of what they did. the key, though, is references like this:\n\n>> An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever: ...  **Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother:** thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land. **The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.** (Deuteronomy 23)\n\ngranted, it's interesting that egyptians are allowed into the congregation, but... edomites are clearly different than ammonites and moabites in the eyes of the author of deuteronomy.\n\n> Edom =/= Midian.

I would be in the middle of a conversation with her, and then suddenly she would go silent. Dumbfounded, I would go back and examine the flow of the conversation, and I learned how to find out where the snag had occurred. It was always the same situation: I had not left her with any comfortable or viable routes to take.  So, I learned not to do that, and to fix it by going back and releasing the series of absolutes that had boxed her in. \n\nThis one was accidentally produced by both of you, as you both appeared to be in agreement with your point of criticism.

It's more like a 3-way traffic jam where each person is waiting for one of the other two to move. \n\nPeople unintentionally lob spells and hexes at each other all day long, and so it's more of a question of focusing on trying not to, as they will often have the opposite effect of what was intended anyway.  It's like watching out for falling tree branches while someone is up there working on the tree.  The worst ones are usually accidental, which is why they're the ones that are the most potent, and can do the most damage.  \n\nMichael Jackson's nose is an example. If the older brother that was teasing him about his \"big nose\" knew that it was going to go that far, I think that he would have released the words, so they wouldn't continue pointing at Michael as a vector that would continually disrupt his sense of equilibrium.  His brother was just trying to get a rise out of Michael on that day, not cast a life-long disfiguring spell on him.", "id": "d3qvacx"}, {"comment": "I appreciate your reading my words with a kind eye. Now I'll explain myself also.\n\nI liked the idea of the \"hex\" a lot, mostly that you identified it specifically, named it, and named it something intuitive and easy to understand what you meant and how it would work. I felt that was extremely intelligent and insightful. In my own studies of the ancient world, I tried to understand how people felt as a conduit to understanding them. I didn't view them under a microscope, but I myself kept Kosher, built an idol by accident (I got so into the practices and thinking, it just became the right thing to do. I later realized what I'd made and how I was treating it and where it was going), and so on. I really connected with and understood ancient attitudes and practices.\n\nI even read works from surrounding cultures of the Ancient Israelites in general to understand their surroundings, reading many histories and cuneiforms myself, even *Egyptian Magic* by Sir Wallis Budge because the Israelite's own cultural lore had an interest in Egypt. Like a European kid might take an keen interest in legends of the knights of the round table and lore from the Middle Ages, so an ancient Israelite kid might think back on Egypt, so I should know ancient Egypt to know how they might have *heard* it. I'd only know if I tried.\n\nSo I familiarized myself with views in general, ways of thinking, and so on. I liked your idea of the \"hex\". Is this how the ancient people, very intelligent and socially-minded people back then, would have understood hexes? Is that why they were \"cast\" or \"pronounced\"? Did folks like /u/donit note these non-phsycial powers, and eventually differentiate between \"black magic\" and good magic? What would happen to us if we began to view alcohol as a potion? Or accept the effect of a piece of art on us as real, and view it as a personal talisman? Is this text with the girl you were having a part of a \"love spell\" that was impeded, and is love like magic, that only certain skilled people can tap or blessed people have bestowed? This was on my mind before we met in a form, and our interaction swept me away. I wanted to see that if I warned against \"breaking the hex\" on the idea that we're not on that level of information or skill (suggesting there are higher levels and *more* floating abstract powers at play, that can be hazards even), would another person be able to interact with what I was saying? Or is this just far too abstract? Or would something completely unexpected happen?\n\nWell here's what I found and my take on that: Your identification on \"hexes\" is real and your view detailed and useful. This was an interesting allegory and an interesting \"thing\". Your details on what a \"hex\" is and how the \"flow\" of a conversation can be impeded by non-physical entities, stopping up a relationship, is very interesting.\n\nThere's a certain man who navigates these subjects very well and has an appreciation for the reality of myth in a credible sense. Look up Dr. Jordan Peterson of Harvard on YouTube. More recently he's at the University of Toronto and his lectures are life-changing to the students. A person like you could get more out of it, I think, than the students he's addressing. Maps of Meaning and Personality and it's Transformations are his two main classes. See Maps of Meaning if you want to see a life's work on what we're talking about.\n\nAnd a final comment, take a look at my last dialog with /u/arachnophillia.

Note anything I may have missed if I missed anything.", "id": "d3scrxt"}, {"comment": "I'm really enjoying watching Jordan Peterson's lectures. Thanks for telling me about him. He is a true scientist, in spite of his academic training rather than because of it. I didn't think we had any real scientists left in the field because nowadays, they are specifically trained not to be, and are taught instead to stick with academic convention and toe the party line. \n\nThey are now all being trained as museum curators for the mainstream, peer-reviewed, footnoted, accepted body of academic knowledge.\n\nIt's great to see there's still an independent thinker out there who isn't afraid to use his mind.  ", "id": "d415alz"}, {"comment": "\"...so I should know ancient Egypt to know how they might have heard it. I'd only know if I tried.\"\n\nThat's a great point.  You're reading the patterns that followed in order to decipher the patterns that proceeded.  If you see a bunch of dominoes lying down on the floor study their positions, you can determine exactly how they fell.\n\nWhenever I'm reading the Bible, I use that technique in order to see right through the words and instantly know exactly what happened.  By watching the flow of the words, you can figure out what happened because words and events follow predictable patterns. \n\nIt's like knowing that dominoes can only fall downhill, so if someone tries to say \"and then the dominoes fell up the hill...\"  No they didn't.  They fell downhill. \n\nWe have modern-day people who cast spells in the forums, and they usually known as trolls.  They will basically toy with people's emotions and entertain themselves by finding new ways to manipulate them.  It's sort of like a video game for them, where they win each level by manipulating a new result.\n\n\"Casting a spell on a girl\"  I guess we're all probably trying to manipulate each other on some level.  You can't really separate communicate from manipulate. Even asking someone a question is manipulating them.   Or maybe you mean secretly?  Like how a girl will ask you a question just to see how you respond?  See, people do it all the time without even realizing it. \n\nI have a secret agenda:  I'm hoping one of these  discussions will lead to a project.\n\nBtw, did you know that putting \"U\" in front of a name pages that person? It's sort of like poking them with your finger to get their attention.\n\n\"Is this how the ancient people, very intelligent and socially-minded people back then, would have understood hexes?\" \n\nYes. In some ways people were less intelligent (technologically) in the way of the hundreds of thousands of facts that we tend to gather.  But in other ways, they were much more intelligent than people today because their minds were freed up from being weighed down by all those facts. \n\nSo, they were probably better than we are at a lot of things.  Can you make a fire out of rubbing sticks together? Can you bring 7 plagues upon an Egyptian ruler, and then talk him into releasing all of his workers?  Can you \"smite\" an entire city with just your family and some hired farmhands...armed with wooden clubs? \n\nI think a lot of those \"miracles\" were just achieved by people with a lot of clarity of focus.\n\nYou're right, alcohol can be called a potion if it is being used as as a tool to change someone's behavior.  I've seen videos of people secretly using non-alcoholic drinks to get people drunk. \n\nSo potions can be used for both their chemical and  psychological influences.\n\n\"Magic\" I don't think of it as magic, as that is just a term that is used by an observer in reference to their not understanding what they are observing.\n\nSkills; yes, some people are definitely skilled at manipulating and influencing others.  That's where the concept of witch came from. And it's a common theme from TV shows and movies.  A woman in the background pulling strings and toying with people's lives. It must be an evolutionary advantage.\n\nArt is real because it influences behavior.  There's even a question as to whether saying something to someone is physically injuring them.  It could be.  Yelling at someone during their golf swing will injure their swing.  If someone is taking a dangerous step, distracting them would make it more dangerous.\n\nPeople are pushed and pulled in all directions by words.\n\n\"Cast a spell\". Yes, sounds like that's where it came from. Like casting a play.\nSome spells are easy, such as casting a spell to make someone feel sick, or to cause them to lose confidence in themselves.  All you have to do is ask them: \"Are you okay? You sure?  You seem like...\" \n\nSometimes that's all it takes to get them spinning that way. And so whenever people do that, they're often just making the person feel worse.\n\nIt's just about getting them to focus on the negative.  But a negative person will do that anyway, because that's their theme. \n\nDr. Peterson is fascinating to listen to.  He seems extremely intelligent and has figured out a lot of things.  Its interesting he was connecting eyesight with snakes.  I guess you need to spot them to avoid stepping on them. So if a primate does a lot of walking, they would need to get good at that. \n\nI had figured humans needed better eyesight to watch out for other humans and be able to recognize them.  Being able to tell when a  group of foreigners are approaching would matter a lot because you don't know what their intention is.  \n\nAnd for the last million years or so, I think humans would have put more pressure on themselves than any other animal. Vision is also about paying attention to detail.  My family had a Cairn terrier who could spot a squirrel far off in the trees before I noticed it.  I remember thinking really? You're barking at that tiny squirrel way up in that tree, way over there on the other side of that field? \n\nMaybe there's something to that hex/traffic jam of words, where you could use it as a tool and create such a traffic jam in order to get someone to stop doing something that you don't like.\n\nI remember an English guy who was wondering if there were any ways to get out of a bar fight when someone is giving you a hard time. Apparently it's a big problem there.  My thought was to make it about them and give them shit about being so grumpy.  It traps them because if they continue harassing you, then they would be climbing back into the box that you just made for them, and giving more weight to what you said.\n\nAnother way would be to make them feel like their bad behavior is falling short.  \"Is that all you can come up with?  Try again. This time with more emphasis. No, louder than that.\" \n\nOr, turn them into a dancing monkey:  \"Haha, that was funny! Do it again! So it again!  No, say it again! Please? That was really funny. Come on, just one more time?\"\n\nThat's just a couple of ways you could trap someone with words. ", "id": "d3v1zeq"}, {"comment": "Hey, where'd ya go?  Did I create a flow-trap again?  See what I mean, it's always a much, much bigger challenge not to do it than to do it.  It's a huge flaw of emails and text messages, and I think the main reason it happens is because each message you send is a tyrannical, unilateral obstacle course that you're asking the other person to go through.\n\nIt's not even a conversation. All a message is is a transcript of a conversation you had with yourself. The other person can't say anything back, and so there's no system of collaboration, agreement or even calibration.  \n\nSo, it's not even a relationship. It's more like a perturbation that you hope they will enjoy. And since it's a perturbation, it's very, very easy for something to come across as maleficent.  (I use the term  \"perturbation\" a lot in physics discussions because everything that happens is some form of it.)\n\nSo if the wording in a textual perturbation could possibly be interpreted as negative or aggressive, since it already is a mildly aggressive intrusion, there is a good chance that the recipient will hear  it with an aggressive spin and in a negative tone, since it was already leaning that way, being something that was protrusively sent.\n\nBut if anything I said was interpreted that way, then that wasn't my intention.  My intention was to engage your interest and imagination, and to compare notes and share knowledge and intelligence with someone who appears to possibly be in the six or seven-figure percentile for it.\n\nAnd so any form of sarcasm, trolling or micro-aggressions, or even the interpretation of such would be extremely counter-productive to that. \n\nFor that reason, I never mock people and rarely use sarcasm, because it confuses intent, waters down the words and makes it nearly impossible for anything to be taken seriously.  \n\nNow when it comes to talking to a girl, that's a different story because you want to confuse your intent in order to stimulate curiosity and interest.  \n\nAll I can do is guess at what the word trap was.  Communicating things like that is pretty much the only way that one person can calibrate, adjust and accommodate another person.\n\nWas it because I was telling you something you already know?  I noticed you were linking other people in each reply you sent to me, and so I got worried that you might not know that that was messaging them.  There's no warning on it that says that that's what it does, and so the only reason I know about it is from watching other people page each other.  \n\nSo I thought maybe you didn't realize you were doing it. \n\nI'm used to only talking one-on-one with people, and so I had assumed that you were the same way, and so I assumed you would have wanted to know if something you were doing was causing people to listen in.\n\n But maybe you are someone who normally talks with groups of people?

Like the week recycled every seven days and seasons every year and moon phases, so many ancient cultures (including the Israelites) saw events from the past as very direct indicators of the future. Therefore, if we're facing Babylon today, it's just like when we faced Egypt and we can have faith that God will do a similar thing. This is why they expected a Messiah, because they first received a messianic king in David. Two, actually, as they also anticipated another like Moses.\n\nApart from that I've never heard any historian say that Egypt in the Exodus was written as a \"stand-in\" for Babylon or the Assyrians, or any reasoning as to why they'd even use Egypt instead of just saying it was Babylon or the Assyrians.\n\n>well, it does retroactively affect history and language. and one of the ways it's doing so is by having an egyptian woman name a child with a hebrew pun. there isn't any good reason to try and actually connect this to egyptian, though. the egyptian etymological argument doesn't hold water, so to speak, because that's not how the egyptian word would be transcribed into hebrew. could it have been modified to fit the hebrew pun? sure, i guess. but it just seems more likely that the stems from three letter hebrew verb, which is not from egyptian.\n\nAlright. [I'll just Wiki it for you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Name) Not my initial source but I was sure they'd have it:\n\n>*Several etymologies have been proposed [for Moses]. An Egyptian root msy, 'child of', has been considered as a possible etymology, arguably an abbreviation of a theophoric name, as for example in Egyptian names like Thutmoses (Thoth created him) and Ramesses (Ra created him),^^[1] with the god's name omitted. Abraham Yahuda, based on the spelling given in the Tanakh, argues that it combines 'water' or 'seed' and 'pond, expanse of water', thus yielding the sense of \"child of the Nile\" (mw-\u0161e).^^[2] The Hebrew etymology in the Biblical story may reflect an attempt to cancel out traces of Moses's Egyptian origins.^^[3]* ~ Christopher B. Hays, *Hidden Riches: A Sourcebook for the Comparative Study of the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East*, Rivka Ulmer, *Egyptian Cultural Icons in Midrash*, Franz V. Greifenhagen, *Egypt on the Pentateuch's Ideological Map: Constructing Biblical Israel's Identity*\n\nSo there are three very good reasons, professional historians and their books specifically on the subject, to connect the name \"Moses\" to the Egyptian language. Now here's the thing, /u/arachnophilia, you're saying some pretty bold things here that are even Googleably false with absolute bravado and misleading your readers.

J is not trying to establish a narrative of how things lead to the present so much as J is trying to comment on the present using a fictional narrative set in the past.\n\nthis is complicated because the P source came along and tried to *frame* the mythological narratives as if they *were* a history, adding in genealogies. so, is the torah a history? *kind of*. not really.\n\n> History tells us about the author.\n\nwell, lots of things tell us about the author. i think you can tell a lot about the author of, say, \"50 shades of grey\" by reading it. i don't think that's a history. i suspect you're misusing the word a bit yourself here; plenty of things of historical value in that they tell us what ancient people thought, and tell us things about their social and historical and political and religious contexts. but not all of those works are *histories* in the sense of their genre.

Each claimed to have the \"right\" view, and the Oral Torah was the formalized Pharisaic view, which they said came from Moses. Meaning that the Oral Torah, whether completely historic and unchanged or completely phoned in and fluid, was still completely on rumor and contingent on the integrity of one sect, who's reputation was on the line for it, an interest that doesn't lend so much to its accuracy as its utility.\n\nThe Sadducees, Essenes, and other lesser sects denied the validity of the Oral Torah completely. They evaporated, and the logic today among Rabbis (priestly descendants of the Pharisees) is that they survived because they're right, and that their survival is a further divine endorsement of the Oral Torah. So if you turn to the religiously Jewish community and ask about their cultural history, they might swear that the Oral Torah is true because it \"won\" at history in a sense. \n\nNow does that mean that the Pharisees are actually arbiters of the Seat of Moses and that the Levites aren't the historic priesthood and final word in ancient Yahwism? No. It means that's the lore *today* because of the Oral Torah's success, not it's accuracy. If you believe that your opinion is divinely protected by God and you cannot be led astray, that can mean that the Oral Torah is true. Lots of sects think this about their view, I'm not picking on religious Jews.\n\nTherefore, because the Torah could exist without the Oral Torah, but the Oral Torah couldn't exist without the Torah, there's is no chicken-egg paradox--the Oral Torah is peripheral and a redundancy in ideal Pharisaic culture.\n\nIt's a great way to know what people thought people thought after the Second Temple Period, which does have some merit. Does it tell us what happened at Sinai that wasn't written? No. It tells us that, at a certain time, some people later thought certain events occurred at Sinai.

In many ways, I'm probably more Howie Becker than Bourdieu (there was an interesting but ultimately not totally satisfying [profile of Howie Becker in the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/outside-game), which in part claimed that he was so popular in France because the anti-Bourdieusians gathered around him as a standard bearer--not an opposition that's a part of American sociology).  I'm very sympathetic to Becker's critique of Bourdieu that these things are not all about domination, and sometimes tastes serve other functions of distinctions besides hierarchies.  I think you can probably see that sympathy in my response.\n\nThat said, I am not sure Bourdieu would disagree with the concept groups use taste for social distinction.... after all, it's the core mechanism of the book he wrote about it.  He goes into far more detail than I do, obviously, his book is thick as the Bible, for instance differentiating between \"legitimate\" and \"personal\" cultural domains.  He goes into specific details about which classes find which pictures the most appealing (working class people love pictures of first communions; aesthetes love picture of tree bark and barn doors), but the essence of it is what you like and what you dislike is part of your class position.  *La Distinction* is clearly only one small part of his broader theories (habitus, field theory, different sorts of capital, etc.), but it's a core mechanism that connects capital and habitus to field.

Most magical beasties are creatures of the night, simply because real threats to people (from predators to exposure to the elements to simply getting lost) are magnified at night, and the stories were backfilled to match that. They often involve dead people, because dead people and their remains are scary/distasteful for obvious evolutionary reasons. And they often involve combining predatory animals and humans, simply because those two things were already two of the most perceptible threats to people.\n\nAnd one other big thing that they tend to have in common is that the things with magical efficacy against them are difficult or expensive to obtain. Originally it was sacrifice of valuable livestock or people, and then iron. It usually evolved into silver, gold, gems, or other objects of pure value without function.\n\nThis itself is rooted in at least three things: if the protections were common things, their effectiveness would be constantly disproven; the human tendency to turn backward the logic that since difficult things are sometimes worthwhile, worthwhile things must be difficult; and the desire of a lot of charlatans to coincidentally require valuable (and portable) materials with which to work their magics.\n\nWhile gold and gems also feature in this, silver is probably the most common throughout most of history because it was just barely at the edge of accessibility for peasants. If giant rubies drive away the demons, there's not much you could do about that, but the family could sometimes scrape together the funds for silver nails for the windowsills.\n\nAnd going back before all this to why silver and gold were considered valuable in the first place, I'd say that the commenter glosses over quite a lot.

"]], [[{"comment": "I'd say that they're drastically underestimating and misunderstanding the folklore history of specie as ward against mystical threats, and assigning far more weight to this one incident than it merits.\n\nAround the world, all cultures have folklore of mystical dangers, and they usually share fundamental structural aspects for fairly obvious reasons. Most magical beasties are creatures of the night, simply because real threats to people (from predators to exposure to the elements to simply getting lost) are magnified at night, and the stories were backfilled to match that. They often involve dead people, because dead people and their remains are scary/distasteful for obvious evolutionary reasons. And they often involve combining predatory animals and humans, simply because those two things were already two of the most perceptible threats to people.\n\nAnd one other big thing that they tend to have in common is that the things with magical efficacy against them are difficult or expensive to obtain. Originally it was sacrifice of valuable livestock or people, and then iron. It usually evolved into silver, gold, gems, or other objects of pure value without function.\n\nThis itself is rooted in at least three things: if the protections were common things, their effectiveness would be constantly disproven; the human tendency to turn backward the logic that since difficult things are sometimes worthwhile, worthwhile things must be difficult; and the desire of a lot of charlatans to coincidentally require valuable (and portable) materials with which to work their magics.\n\nWhile gold and gems also feature in this, silver is probably the most common throughout most of history because it was just barely at the edge of accessibility for peasants. If giant rubies drive away the demons, there's not much you could do about that, but the family could sometimes scrape together the funds for silver nails for the windowsills.\n\nAnd going back before all this to why silver and gold were considered valuable in the first place, I'd say that the commenter glosses over quite a lot.

The biggest reason they'd be low risk is the low amount of sexual partners (however those partners are more likely to have HIV so it does require some balancing). For the 16-25 range you mention, that age group specification is unnecessary. The not using protection regularly and having varying sexual partners is the risk factor, not the age (in fact since HIV rates are decreasing, and HIV is a lifelong thing, having sex with younger people would be safer. Remember every 50 year old was a 25 year old at some point).\n\nGoing off of the CDC rates (80% of males who are newly diagnosed with HIV are MSM), a man who engages in sex with 5 MSM is more likely to be at risk than a man who engages in sex with 20 women.

That means nine out of ten men who engaged in msm identified as straight. \n\nFurther, the chances of those nine out of ten engaging in unprotected sexual contact is much higher, because it stands to reason that at least some of that contact is of the anonymous, t-room hookup type of sexual contact.\n\nThe conclusion should be obvious: you can't compare the percentage of the population of self-labeling gay men (regardless of how underestimated it is) with the number of new infections directly linked to msm because the men engaging in msm are overwhelmingly larger than the people self-labeling as gay, and that overwhelmingly large number is likely engaging in unsafe practices proportionately higher than those who self-label.\n\nAnd one little quick aside:\n\n>The margin of error on that sort of statistic is usually well over 2x that 2% figure depending on where the polling is done, when, and how the question is phrased. \n\nIt also depends upon age; recent polls show that the percentage of people self-labeling as gay increases as age goes down, with people in their early 20s at 10%.

There are thousands of forms of 'competitive debating', but the biggest forms are split between Public Speaking-style debates, and British Parliamentary-style debating.\n\nPublic Speaking is a lot more like the televised debates (the head-to-head types at least) because you are given plenty of time to prepare. You make opening statements, responses, open rebuttals, and then closing statements. The tactics for each stage is very different, and while they aren't too many rules about what you should do, there is a style that everyone follows pretty much because it is the most effective way to do it. \n\nOpening speeches are about setting up your position. Identifying the burdens that you position has to prove (If you are talking about income inequality, for example, that burden could be to identify it as a problem (unless both sides are in agreement that it exists) or that your proposition is actually a solution), laying out the initial structure within which you are working, and giving the broadest, most obvious points. The opposition can try to tackle what you have said, but most will make comparative analysis alongside their prepared material. Let's say we are still talking about income inequality, and the proposition are talking the socialist view, and opposition aren't. The Opp will probably just make their usual points within their opening speech, but pointing out where they disagree, and possibly why they are better.\n\nThe second speeches are responses, which are very heavily focused on comparative analysis. Illustrating exactly what your point is, and how your method works, and why it works over what they are doing. \n\nThe Open Rebuttal stage is super boring but audiences like it because it looks fun, people taking jabs at each other, poking holes in each other, but the statements are all very brief and as a result lacking good substantive. And then the closing stage is all about linking all your analysis to the question proposed, and why your side was the better one.\n\nIt's all about setting up your idea, and then defending through both supporting evidence and de-constructing the oppositions argument.\n\nBritish Parliamentary is what I spent my time doing, and is more heavily practised worldwide. It is the form that is used in the World Competitions. I think BP is better for learning how to debate because you only have 15 minutes to prepare for the debate, and don't know which side you will be arguing for before those fifteen minutes. \n\nAs a result of not being able to look up stats and facts, BP is more about how arguments are constructed. About systematically building up the logical burdens and arguments of each point for your side. The analysis has to be really thick because you can't just throw out stats to try and discredit it*, meaning you have to respond by producing either more compelling arguments that follow through in more satisfying and believable logical steps, or by tackling the core logic of the opposing side.\n\n*You can throw facts and figures out to an extent, as judges are expected to have the knowledge of an average newspaper reading member of the public. So if you are basing your argument on things which are 'obviously' incorrect people can call you out on it.\n\nBP debating is also built from four teams of two. With two teams per side, and with each position having much more formalised roles (the last speakers from each side must 'summate' the argument, and are unable to bring in new information), and teams on the same side being unable to communicate before or during the debate. The whole structure is built to make you have to understand how to argue, not how much you can remember about specific case studies.\n\nIn Public Speaking style is weighted as a consideration, while in BP it is only an extra caveat. You can be the most boring person in the world and win debates if you produce extremely well analysed arguments, but good argumentative construction is usually entertaining anyway.\n\nSo when you compare all this formalised style, and excessive emphasis on argumentation that cannot be refuted simply, you end up with interesting and compelling discussions on various topics. When you hear very skilled competitive debaters bicker among themselves the language used for simple discussions far exceeds what you hear in the most televised political debates. Not in terms of being fancy words or long Latin expressions, but that statements are rested on previous argumentation to support them. \n\nIn the last election there was that moment where Obama criticised Romney for saying that the Navy had shrunk down. Obama said something along the lines 'We have less horses now as well, war has changed, blah blah blah'. In a debate that would have won you all of a stalemate in terms of arguments.\n\nWhat does the size of our Navy have to do with our national security? Is it for protecting from external forces attacking the US, or is it about having the ability to exert a power on to others? Our Navy has shrunk because 'war has changed', but in what ways has war changed that has made a Navy less relevant? We can all intuitively understand why horses are less prevalent, but Navies are less obvious? \n\nBoth statements were made back and forth without any explanation for why they were actually important. So what it ended up actually being was two people making adverts for people who already agreed with them. That's not debate, it's not even argumentation, it's barely even a disagreement. I think I have had more impassioned arguments about which Star Wars film was better, and probably used better debate logic than the presidential debates.\n\nAnd the UK is pretty much the same, we have shit political discourse here. We have a new Labour leader, who, to an extent, engages in more long-form considered arguments and all that happens is that he is quote mined and taken out of context. So the future of discourse is likely to be really shit until someone finds a moderator that will rip apart everyone with equal ferociousness that you know you are going to have to be extremely competent at considering, and defending your position, with proper analysis and comparative analysis that candidates will only put themselves forward if they know they are not going to look like a twat at the end.", "id": "cztqta6"}, {"comment": "Definitely looks like the UK debate scene is different than the U.S one.    Here the most popular forms are Policy, which is now a speed reading contest, Parliamentary which is different than the British version, and Lincoln Douglas which is two people going head to head.", "id": "cztsknb"}, {"comment": "Yeah, there's a shifting meta in most nations that do debate.\n\nSome variation on Parliamentary is common pretty much everywhere, with BP in specific being a co-commonality because that's how Worlds are run.  \n\nI'm Canadian, we ran Canadian Parliamentary for half the year (all our in-house and half our national tournaments) and then BP for the other half while teams trained up for Worlds.  CP and your Parliamentary are *similar* but just different enough to be confusing as fuck crossing the line without a real detailed primer.  \n\nFor those unfamiliar, both American and Canadian Parliamentary styles are two teams of two rather than four, divided as Government and Opposition.  Gov \"brings a case\" or motion that they wish to debate \"The House Believes That ...\" or \"The House Would Legalize ...\", and Opp's first speaker has until Gov's first speaker finishes laying out what the case is and their argumentation in support of it (seven minutes) to work out an initial clash and opposition to Gov's proposal.  Topics come from the teams, and planning what cases you want to run as Gov is part of preparing for events.  \n\nAs a result, the burden of what knowledge any given competitor is expected changes a little - the gold standard for BP is \"is it in The Economist?\" and there's a fairly large breadth of current events and world politics you're expected to have passing familiarity with in order to effectively participate.  In CP/AP, the bar for \"specialized knowledge\" or \"spec\" is set much lower - effectively, observable knowledge and logic rather than rote facts.  Sending a case too far into territory your judges or audience may not be able to follow, even if both teams can, often results in point loss.  If your gov case wins or loses based on whether or not the opponent knows as much about the topic as you, judges are very likely to just give it to the other team.\n\nRounds and individual speakers are judged for a combination of persuasiveness, maintaining threads, and argumentative content or substance.  \n\nPolicy is ... fucked.  [Absurd as hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZeDq90Ar4k&feature=youtu.be&t=23).

Your microwave oven is typically 600-1000W while your phone and router operate at less than 1W.

Even if it is a small amount of absorbed energy the speed of light tells us that there will be hundreds of millions of reflections off of the walls of said box every second for each radiation source. So if you had an EM source *equivalent* to 10,000 phones the walls of the box would heat up (this is why they don't want you to run a microwave with nothing in it).  It is also why a box made of mirrors with a light bulb in it wouldn't perceptibly stay lit after the light goes out.\n\nUnfortunately putting 10,000 phones in a box is fairly pointless because pretty much every material has some amount of loss to it and the sheer number of phones in the box means that the radiation will be absorbed by the surrounding phones (made of plastic, glass and metal) and the temperature will rise imperceptibly over time.    The result would be very similar to putting a single phone in a small metal box or wrapping it in aluminum foil.  If you somehow managed to completely thermally isolate the phone box the heat from the CPU on the phone would cook the device long before it could emit enough energy to raise the temperature of the entire device.\n\n", "id": "cz0m893"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cz0k0u3"}, {"comment": "Guess I forgot /r/depthhub is now a default sub.

I can speak for the absolute majority of Tunisians when I say that they are disillusioned with how things are going and that they don't share the optimism that foreigners have regarding our country. There is a saying in Arabic that says \"The people of Mecca know its routes the best\", meaning the natives know best about their country. It is too hard to change an outsider's view about Tunisia because first they give too much weight to the political success in there, and second because of medias that don't give out all the details in the same way Tunisians know about them. There is too much weight given to the \"political success\" of the country (that if there is any political success at all, appearances are not that correct), and little weight given to the fact that the things that matter the most haven't changed (the old regime and the old system still ruling from behind the veils, police brutality, the political elite from all parties ignoring the people's pleas while dividing power between themselves and remembering people only to gain their votes before every election, youth not getting any power to effectively participate in the system, the fact that multinational companies and their respective host countries have way too much power in detriment of self-determination....)\n\n====\nThere is acknowledgment of the economic issue and the terrorist problems, but there is not enough acknowledgment of the causes behind them and, sadly enough, ignorance of these causes sometimes.\n\n=======\n(And btw I am confident that the optimism you have is only shared by the members of a certain political affiliation in here (a political affiliation I used to be part of, before getting disenchanted with its leaders). So I know why you wrote your comment and I know you have honest and good intentions, but I just needed to point out for the sake of clarity).\n\n=====\nThe things that /u/yodatsracist is explicitly wrong about :\n\n===\n1) Ennahdaa didn't work close enough with other parties after the revolution. Aside from two other (small) parties that ruled with them, all the other parties were extremely critical, distrustful, and borderline agressive towards them. All state medias after the fall of Ben Ali fell into the control of the anti-Ennahdha political spectrum (radical left and old regime members), and nearly brought the country into civil war when it engaged in a mediatic war, spreading rumors left and right, demonizing the Islamists, accusing them of perpertuating the 2 assassinations of some leftist politicians, and even went as to call for a coup like what happened to the MB in Egypt. UGTT (one of the members of the \"Quartet for national dialogue\", the folks who didn't deserve the Nobel price for peace for 2015 at all) was/is still led by the radical left, and nearly brought the entire country to its knees with non-stop strikes in all the economic domains after the revolution in order to make matters towards the Ennahdha governement who tried to fix the economy. It was Ennahdha who didn't fight back and let them get what they wanted, which is why an Egyptian coup didn't happen in Tunisia, at the price of the old regime getting back to rule.\n\n=====\n2) Secularists didn't \"agree to respect the Islamists religious practices\". Ennahdha and Nidaa tounes endede up sharing power as a result of their own political game, but that's it. There was constant backlash between islamists and secularists in medias and social websites over all sorts of things, from the right to wear Burqaa all the way to public prayers in streets..\n\n====\n3) \"he opposition factions were in dialogue years before the Arab Spring and had already had some basic understandings worked out before Ben Ali was forced from office\"\n\n====\nSee my two first points. Yes there was a coalition of sorts between Islamists and non-islamists to oppose Ben Ali in 2005, but first not all anti-islamists were part of it, and second they all forgot about it after Ben Ali left and all started fighting between themselves.\n\n=====\n4) \"There have been a lot of disagreements, but the various sides have always agreed to solve them through elections and democracy\".\n\n=====\nAs I said before, there was even calls for a coup d'etat after Morsi got taken down in Egypt, and state medias openly hosted speakers who urged the military to intervene and kick Ennahdha from ruling. Including the UGTT. Fortunately , the military wasn't interested in doing so, and that's why a coup didn't happen. Ennahdha ended up not openly supporting Marzouki (its former ally, a former opolitical opponent of Ben Ali) against Sebsi (its former archnemesis, and old regime member) in the 2014 elections, which led to Sebsi winning the elections, in exchange for the state medias to stop attacking Ennahdha and Ennahdha gaining some seats in the government (at the cost of alienating some of their popular base, from which I was)", "id": "d1kf2cl"}, {"comment": "I don't think I disagree with you on much of anything factual, but I do disagree with how to interpret what's happened/happening. First of all, the English language media coverage of Tunisia is awful and, since I don't speak Arabic, when I want to know about Tunisia, I have struggle through French articles, which I'm usually too lazy to do. Not counting articles mainly about Libya, there's been [one article in the NYT primarily about Tunisia in the past month](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/03/22/world/middleeast/ap-ml-tunisia-state-of-emergency.html), and then I think just [one more in the month before that](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/world/africa/tunisia-kasserine-jobs-protest.html) to give some sense of the English language coverage (there was also [a third](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/world/middleeast/tunisia-curfew-unemployment.html) just over two months ago). Which is my way of saying I am sure you know more than I do on the subject. \n\nHowever, I think it's undeniable that Tunisia is a relative success. We'll see if the secularists (for lack of a better term--a huge portion of whom are absolutely old regime people) will be willing to cede power back if and when they lose an election. Assuming they continue to have elections--I guess we'll see if the state of emergency ever gets lifted. Personally, I don't think Essebi believes in democratic values, as I firmly think Gannouchi does. \n\nBut I think a lot of what you point to are, counter-intuitively, signs of the success of the revolution. Tunisia has moved from autocratic government to all the shittiness of democracy. I firmly agree with Winston Churchill, who quipped:\n\n>Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\n\nI don't know if you follow US politics, but (less extreme) forms of what you're talking about have been common features of the American system in recent years. Debates over what's \"secular purpose\" and what's \"reasonable accommodation\" to religious beliefs and practices continue and will continue, in the media, courts, and legislature. That's the way democracy is. You realize that every year one media channel claims that there is a \"War on Christmas\" instigated by the party they oppose? It's absurd. Granted, in America, there's no cloud of assassinations or threat of a coup, but there is incendiary partisan media, there is purposeful sabotage of the political process (the one party nearly shut down the whole government not too long ago), there are lots of political compromises that the core both parties hate. We're about to have a presidential election between the two of the least popular candidate candidates in the history of the country! It's ugly, and in Tunisia it's been *very* ugly, but it's--for the most part-- democracy. \n\nNow, I'm worried over the medium term that Essebi et al. might never give up power. I'm worried that reforms for the economy will be slow and protests will continue to unsettle the political process, that media might only become more restricted, and all of that. Tunisia certainly hasn't made the progress that either of us has hoped. But I think it's made *some progress*. I think it says a lot about how the sole \"success story\" is deeply, deeply troubled, and has been in some ways staring into the Abyss since 2011. People expect that after the Revolution there will be magic and rainbows, or at least solutions. It's rarely like that. Look to Eastern Europe--25 years after the 1989 Revolutions, some countries have slipped from democracy to authoritarianism (Russia, for example), and several others have democratically elected governments that, like Tunisia's, that seem illiberal to the point that their opponents call them anti-Democratic (Hungary is one example, but we'll see about Poland's new government as well). Democracy is a lot, a lot harder, slower, and stupider than most people appreciate. \n\nI can understand the pessimism (and you're right--it's something that every Tunisian I've talked to has mentioned, though I haven't talked to that many). And yes, there have been lots of ugly back room deals and bargains, and many sides have tried to play spoiler to the process, and absolutely the limited cooperation for the good of the country that we saw before Ben Ali left has not continued suing democracy.  And yes, Tunisia is in danger of slipping back into authoritarianism.  I think the important thing is it hasn't slipped there yet. For everything that has and hasn't happened, I firmly firmly do believe it is not only a relative success story (compared to Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, etc that's not even really a debate) but in a very absolute way *on track*.

When you have a hammer, and you're biased against nails, everything looks like a nail. He also just sort insults the intelligence of the people he sees that don't understand, but that isn't very helpful to us in understanding whats going on.\n\nI've taken classes on both Islam and Terrorism. The issue with terrorism is that every major religion in the world has had terrorists come from its ranks (including Buddhism). It isn't the specific religion that causes terrorism, its actually always politics underlyingly. By definition terrorism is about asymmetric warfare, about a power relationship between two or more sides, and therefore is political in nature. \n\nLet me differentiate though:\n\n***Act of Terror:***\n\nAn act of terror can be committed by one or more individuals for the purpose causing terror in a general or target populace. These sorts of attacks are usually fundamentally about untreated mental illness playing out. Think of the Colombine Shooters. They were in it for the effect, but had no really over-arching motive beyond that. They just wanted to do harm to people, some they didn't like and some just because they could. This is an act of terror.\n\n***State-Terror:***\n\nState-sponsored terror, should also be differentiated as states have been know to enact terror as a tool against enemies. War has often involved actions whose primary focus was terroristic. If the state commits the act themselves, we call it State terror, and if they simply sponsor it, as you might surmise, we call it state-sponsored terrorism. The difference here is that when states do it, its not about a smaller power trying to equalize power relationship, its just another tactic of war.  \n\n***Terrorism:***\n \nTerrorism is not merely an act of terror and ISIS is not a group that commits mere acts of terror. They are terrorists. They  ***do*** terrorism. This is to say they, as the weaker power in a relationship between powers, are using terror to cause psychological damage to an enemy population because more conventional warfare is not an option to them realistically (they don't have the man power, weapons, vehicles, expertise). \n\n***The Politics of Terror:***\n\nNow politics can be religiously focused. Churches, sects, creeds, etc. can and are political entities. The radical clerics that organize, radicalize, etc. for ISIS and other groups are religious figures and they use religious arguments to persuade their adherents. The fighters themselves view things through a religious lens and justify their actions religiously. However, the reason we know what their doing is primarily political is because A) the methods they use are political (terror as I mentioned is political), and B) the historical reason fundamentalism grew to be what it is today in the Islamic world, is because of political power. It was a push back, not only against the westernization that hadah24 talks about, but against western/soviet incursion/control. It would be like some other super power putting up a puppet government in the US, and then the more die-hard Christian Fundamentalists ousting them and taking over. That is a matter of politics, not religion. It just so happens a highly religious group took control. hdah24 is getting into the minds of the fighters themselves when he talks about how important Islam is to understanding ISIS, but fundamentally ISIS is more a response to a lawless, power vacuum left by Saddam, the US, and the Syrian government. It was an opportunity for a group to take over politically, and they took it. The average fighter's perspective, though important for dealing with issues like radicalization, tells us nothing about the real underlying reason any of this taking place. \n\nMy argument is that, while you should not disassociate ISIS with Islam, you also shouldn't assume that Islam is the primary focus either. It isn't. Its about power and control, which is politics. \n\nHe says here:\n\n>Some of those things have elements of truth - marginalization, poverty and retribution certainly are causes as well. Yet the biggest cause, above anything else, is their religious belief.\n\nThese things don't just have elements of truth, they core to why Terrorism happens everywhere it happens. What we would call ISIS is a 'weak-actor', that is a weaker power, whom is striking against a larger power. The reason they are weaker, is historical, economic, and sociological. Historically they dealt with western incursion (the CIA specifically), economically they are often deeply reliant on oil or other captured commodities, and sociologically they are living in incredibly unequal societies. These are the biggest reasons that fundamentalism took over, as each issue feeds into the other issues and lowers standard of living, education, etc. Happy populaces don't resort to guns, fundamentalism, revolt, and terrorism in a large way (there are always some kooks, as you might find in the US). You can say this sort of view is liberal and paternalistic, but I am not arguing they are not responsible for their actions, or that west should feel particularly responsible (except maybe the CIA, ha), or they know not what they do, or that pure ignorance is the biggest issue here. Factually, most terrorists tend to be educated, the same way most revolutionary organizers come from educated middle classes. Islam, specifically fundamentalist Islam, is their outlook and their personal justification, but nothing more than that. Beyond that lies the politics of power, history, and society in the Islamic world. The human mind can find justification for any action in any religion.  \n\n***TL;DR:*** ISIS is very much an Islamic group, but terrorism isn't a religious thing, its a political thing, and so to say that that the root cause of ISIS is religion, is absolutely not true. Its politics, always politics. The whole reason ISIS exists, was able to take power, and is as fundamentalist as it is, is because of politics. Terrorism = politics. "], [118, "It's funny to say, but feels like he's sacrificing nuance in the name of arguing for it.  \n\n>It is wrong to say \"ISIS are not Muslims\" and it is extremely unhelpful to separate them from the religion. [...] if you ignore the religious roots of the group then you cannot possible grasp the problem.\n\nThis is of course absolutely correct...\n\n>Some of those things have elements of truth - marginalisation, poverty and retribution certainly are causes as well. Yet the biggest cause, above anything else, is their religious belief. If you are an atheist like me, you can only truly understand this by imagining how you would see the world if you were a fundamentalist Muslim.\n\n...While this is reaching exceptionally far and exceptionally liberally to dismiss other substantial contributions to what's taking place for ISIS in order to deliver the blame as much as possible on the religion of Islam itself.  \n\nFor instance, it seems he's skipping past the radicalization process almost entirely, ignoring the fact that western recruits did not necessarily come from radical communities and were not necessarily born, bred, and educated as Islamic radicals.  \"Marginalization\" is a far bigger contribution in those cases than \"Islam\" per se, because the need for belonging and identity is what made those men recruits, Islam was just the particular flag they were united under.  \n\nUnderstanding what they believe is indeed essential in understanding ISIS, as OP's teacher points out.  But paying attention to *why* they believe those things, or that specific version of Islam ... that feeds into how they're growing, and what large-scope social, financial, etc. factors are strengthening or enabling them ... those are just as important if we want a meaningful holistic view of 'the problem'.  \n\nWould Europe be so ripe for recruitment if Europe hadn't so substantially marginalized their immigrant communities?  Or is Islam just *that* seductive and persuasive that the faith is far more important than socio-economics?  I'd strongly suggest the former rather than the latter.  \n\nAnd as we get deeper into the text, it feels more and more like OP's personal feelings about religion come into the narrative more and more.  \n\n>Because the fundamentalists would argue, and in a way I agree with them, that the beliefs of these people are so far removed from the original message and meaning of the religion that they are not truly Muslims, or Christians or Jews. In order to achieve a form of Islam, or Christianity, or Judaism that is acceptable to 'Western society', you have to reshape and twist the doctrine of that religion SO MUCH that it can start to not make sense at all.\n\nI mean...  that seems to summarize to \"any religion that isn't text-literalist and as violent and radical as that demands is a false faith\" ... Y'all don't study *faith* per se, do ya?  Take Catholicism, close to the 'true-est' still extant denomination of Christianity - text literalism isn't even real to them.  Even most staunch and dogmatic belief holds 'God made the world, god made the bible, if the bible doesn't agree with the world, we're interpreting the bible wrong.'\n\nAdaptive faith tenets and dogma are just as core to most major religions as believing in things or having odd rituals. *Text literalism*, rather than adaptation, is the newer 'invention' in most faiths I'm familiar with, though the specifics of Islam in particular I'm happy to leave to the experts.\n\n>The priest would tell us that Christianity preaches equality, freedom and love for everybody, including people from other faiths. But then we would go and read the Bible, and it didn't have that message at all. It told us to commit genocide on people of other faiths. It was violent, and brutal, and had so many historical problems with it that it was hard to believe. The religion didn't make logical sense any more. \n\nLet's cut to the chase on this one.  Religions **have never made logical sense**.  And the man telling you about peace and love and equality?  His job title is \"preacher\" and if he's saying it in his role on behalf of that faith, that is actually what that faith is 'preaching' because it's a damn tautology.  More, most faiths including both Islam and Christianity have scholars, faith leaders, 'experts' whose job it is to provide interpretation to the holy books used entirely because it's possible for a layperson with an agenda to spin some passage out any of them that supports anything they want. "], [57, "No offense to /u/hdah24, but I think this is rather wrong.  First of all, any study of any religion will show that religion is always full of people who don't actually follow the letter of the law.  Modernity has likely increased this to some extent (as in modernity has let more temptations in, like more alcohol into Muslim countries and more sex into Christian ones), but it's a historical constant.  See Mark Chaves address when he was president for the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (the main association of psychologists, sociologists, and political scientists who study religion) called, \"Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy\".  Here's the abstract:\n\n>Religious congruence refers to consistency among an individual's religious beliefs and attitudes, consistency between religious ideas and behavior, and religious ideas, identities, or schemas that are chronically salient and accessible to individuals across contexts and situations. Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research establish that religious congruence is rare, but much thinking about religion presumes that it is common. The religious congruence fallacy occurs when interpretations or explanations unjustifiably presume religious congruence.\n\nTo assume this is unique to Islam, or some how particularly conducive to violence, is absurd.\n\nBut more, it assumes that fundamentalist Muslims are some how inherently violent (As a sidetone: oh how I hate the word fundamentalist--it comes out of a specific debate within American Presbyterianism in the 1920's and has come to stand in for \"religion we don't like\".  If it's related to some sort of Biblical inerrancy or truth, well then I'm a fundamentalist Jew and I like to think I'm a pretty reasonable, non-violent guy). Fundamentalist does not mean violent.  There are tens of millions of Fundamentalist Christians in America (well, if we pay attention to the difference between Fundamentalist and Evangelical they're not, but I don't get a sense that this person understand that difference since, to them, everyone who tries to follow the words of scripture appears to be a fundamentalist).  There are also of tens of millions of non-literalists Christians (and Muslims) who don't seem to have the problems that /u/hdah24 (I'm just going to use \"he\" from now on, sorry if you're a woman) assumes are inherent.  \n\nHe says: \n\n>Fundamental Islam IS incompatible with Western-style liberal democratic society.\n\nwithout any evidence.  Evangelical (to /u/hdah24 fundamentalist) Christianity has also been a major pilar of American democracy since 1980.  \"Fundamentalist\" parties (if we include Shas) often make up almost 1/3 of the seats in Israel.  Christian Democrats, who are often the major conservative party in Latin America and Catholic Europe, started off in a way that I'm sure /u/hdah24 would describe as fundamentalist.  The Al Nur Party in the Egypt election was a Salafi party, and they weren't an inherent threat to democracy.  There are plenty of religious parties in Indonesia's democracy, and I'd guess most that a majority of Indonesian would say that the Quran and the Hadith are literally true and that people should live by those codes.  Religious people can be Democrats as well.  To argue that all \"religious codes are outdated\" is kind of silly, when the vast majority of Americans are religious and have been since the founding of this great nation.  Even today, atheists and agnostics are relatively rare.  To quote an older post of mine:\n\n>There are four types of \"religious nones\" that show up in survey questions: atheists, agnostics (both self-ID), and \"nothing in particular\" which can be subdivided into \"religion is important\" and \"religion is not important\".  If we include the atheists plus the the \"nothing in particular-religion not important\" and the atheists and agnostics, in the Pew Religious Landscape Survey we end up with about 10% of Americans in 2007 and 16% of Americans in 2015.  Of those, 4% were atheist/agnostic in 2007 and 7% were atheist/agnostic in 2015.  Those are probably smaller numbers than you expected, first of all, but they're fairly consistent.  If you look at a different data set, like the General Social Survey (which goes back to 1972), what you see is a pretty steady rise from about 5-6% \"nones\" (no stated religious affiliation--including people who have no stated religious preference but think religion is important).  In the GSS data, we don't pass 10% \"religious nones\" until the mid-1990's, though in the 2014 survey the religious nones passed 20% (the Pew survey had 23% total nones in 2014).\n\nSo clearly we don't need secular voters for democracy, even if we do require a government that is open to both secular and non-secular voters.  What about the claims about religion and violence?  Let's just take Salafism, what most people mean when they say \"fundamentalist Muslim\".  Most Salafis aren't terrorists.  Most Salafis aren't violent.  There are generally three groups of Salafis you see in the academic literature: hakkari (activist, like the al Nur Party in Egypt--they got about 20% of the vote), quietist (who eschew politics and were long the dominant group, though there's some sense that it's changing), and jihadi (the group of Al Qaeda and ISIS).  There's no great survey data on these guys, but every scholar would agree that jhadis make up a minority of Salafis (whether hakkaris or quietists dominate depends on the country--in Egypt, hakkaris, in Morocco, seemingly quietists).  Now, there were violent Salafis around 1800, who occupied Mecca and Medina and created the First Saudi State (the current one is the third), but then they mostly disappeared for several decades and weren't really representative of Salafis and other literalists Muslims elsewhere.  Anything like contemporary Jihadis really don't show up until the 1980's.  We don't even see Islamist militants in *Palestine* before the 1980's--Islamic Jihad was founded in the early 1980's, Hamas in the late 1980's, and for the decades before that most Palestinian terrorism was led by secular leftists.   If *any* of /u/hdah24's analysis is right about fundamentalist Islam and violence, surely we'd see it more strongly before the 1980's, right?  But we don't.  I mean, you could push it back to 1979 maybe, and earlier than that in a few places (Islamist violence takes off in Egypt in the 1950's for example).   We also expect to see the most Islamic violence in the most modernist Muslim countries, like Albania and Turkey and Azerbaijan, but against we don't.  \n\nThis is just ahistorical hokum masquerading as a historical analysis.  It just happens to be several paragraphs long.  All that he's right about is that we need to understand that ISIS and Al Qaeda are rooted in Islam, but we shouldn't see the average Muslim as a terrorist ([more on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/4bjr6z/the_silver_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/d19y5d1?context=1), but those are mostly quick, off the cuff remarks).

I down voted this post and I'm surprised to see it on /r/depthhub (on /r/bestof, maybe)."], [16, "You'd be better off reading Scott Atran on this subject than reading /u/hdah24.  [This piece](https://aeon.co/essays/why-isis-has-the-potential-to-be-a-world-altering-revolution) is especially good. \n\n>All of the European political imports and even nationalism itself (except maybe for Turkey, Egypt and Iran, which are still more built around ethnicity and faith than national identity per se) have failed in the Middle East, and miserably so. People are longing for something in their history, in their traditions, with their heroes and their morals; and the Islamic State, however brutal and repugnant to us and even to most in the Arab-Muslim world, is speaking directly to that.\n\n>Yet the US and Western powers don\u2019t seem to recognise that revival. The hackneyed solutions amount to a tired call to shore up the broken nation-state system imposed in the aftermath of the First World War by the European victors, Great Britain and France, and a reaffirmation of \u2018moderate Islam\u2019, which appeals to young people\u2019s longings for adventure, glory, ideals and significance even less than does the eternal promise of shopping malls.\n\n>Still, the popular notion of a \u2018clash of civilisations\u2019 between Islam and the West is woefully misleading. Violent extremism represents not the resurgence of traditional cultures, but their collapse, as young people unmoored from millennial traditions flail about in search of a social identity that gives personal significance and glory. This is the dark side of globalisation. Individuals radicalise to find a firm identity in a flattened world. In this new reality, vertical lines of communication between the generations are replaced by horizontal peer-to-peer attachments that can cut across the globe.\n\n>As I told the UN Security Council this spring, what inspires the most lethal assailants in the world today is not so much the Quran or religious teachings but rather a thrilling cause and a call to action that promises glory and esteem in the eyes of friends. Foreign volunteers for the Islamic State are often youth in transitional stages in their lives \u2013 immigrants, students, people between jobs and before finding their mates. Having left their homes, they seek new families of friends and fellow travellers to find purpose and significance.\n\nThis quote from /u/hdah24 is really odd:\n\n> If I believed that the world was going to end and I had to obey the law of the all-seeing, all-knowing, all-powerful deity in order to reach eternal paradise, I'd do whatever the hell was needed to get on his good side. If that means killing people, why wouldn't I? This world is just a temporary, physical one. It's worth it for infinity in paradise. And they are non-believers anyway, they know nothing.\n\n>If that is how you see the world and that is how you understand it, then these acts of violence make sense. The whole Islamic State makes sense.\n\nThis line of reasoning is often repeated in the West but is it actually what happens?  Atran's research has showed that that is NOT how people who join ISIS or or other groups view things.  In fact Atran writes that after interviews with several jihadi leaders, every one of them [told him](https://evolution-institute.org/article/here-he-goes-again-sam-harriss-falsehoods/) \"that anyone seeking to become a martyr in order to obtain virgins in paradise would be rejected outright.\"  [His article here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jul/19/terrorism-radical-religion) explains the actual reasons that these people become violent.  \n\nViolence, and extreme violence in particular, should be seen as a political tactic, not some crazy, hard-for-us-rational-people-to-understand method to appease Allah.  \n\n> \"Brutal terror scares the hell out of enemies and fence-sitters. ... Asymmetric operations involving spectacular killings to destabilise the social order is a tactic that has been around as long as recorded history. Violent political and religious groups routinely provoke their enemies into overreacting, preferably by committing atrocities to get the others to drive in the sheep and collect the wool.\"\n\nIt is trivially true that ISIS is an Islamic group.

How his post got so much attention, I don't know. Perhaps it's because it caters to Reddit's liberal and atheist audience?\n\nOne point that annoys me as a Muslim and is consistently overlooked in such discussions is that, at the most fundamental level, extremist groups simply use Islam as a tool to further their political agenda.\n\nNow why Islam, you ask? Because it's in \"vogue\". Because it's the easiest way to gain sympathizers, given the turmoil in the region and frequent Western escapades over the past century. Because of the trouble faced by youth all over the Middle East thanks to Western-backed dictatorships. And so on.\n\nMost crucially, people seem to overlook the fact that what IS is doing under the banner of Islam could have been done for any other religion or political or social cause. If that other religion or cause was much easier for troubled youth to sympathize with than Islam, extremists would have used it without hesitation.\n\nSo the way I see it is that it's not a question of who is Muslim and who's not, but rather why Islam and what are their political goals as a group."], [4, "Something in what this guy says is off but I'm not knowledgeable enough to spot it.\n\nIs his point that the fundamentalists are following the true word of the scripture and the moderates aren't? Then the problem I have (as an atheist) is that all the texts are written and translated by humans and make most quotes of scripture are highly selective. Because (I think) religion itself is inherently self contradictory you can't pin the cause of radicalization onto the belief that one must follow scripture absolutely cause that's just not possible.\n\nSometimes I wish people just didn't take religion so seriously. It's not inherent truth but a tool for us to understand life. And like a tool, it can be beneficial and also destructive."], [2, "/u/hdah24 makes a point that you don't often see - the worldview is the largest factor.\n\nI used to be a very fundamentalist Christian.  I grew up in a more moderate setting, met some people who were more serious about their faith, read through the bible, and I suppose in a way I ended up \"radicalizing\" myself. Cost me a few years of life, I lived like a hippie, started prayer groups and worked for homeless shelters.  I think I accomplished a fair bit of good during this time of my life. \n\nMy worldview at the time was similar to what he describes.  I saw this world as temporary, a clear and seemingly obvious way to eternal paradise, so who wouldn't want to trade a temporary world for an eternal one?  What difference did it make if I had a career, for example?  Wouldn't God provide anyway?\n\nWhat changed my worldview in the end was being hurt by people I trusted.  It seems small but it created a situation I couldn't resolve in my mind.  People I recognized as \"real Christians\" turning against me over petty things.  I couldn't say they weren't \"real Christians\" but \"real Christians\" are a family... so how do I deal with them? Then I prayed for divine intervention... to have God change their minds or intervene in some way and the prayer wasn't answered and I had another dilemma. If the prayer wasn't answered then perhaps I expected to much. But if I expected too much what should I expect?  Well, I never figured out the answer, so I left to do other things with my life, then got tired of the question.\n\nIt was a combination of the desire for higher purpose and the estrangement of moderate Christianity from the scriptures that edged me toward a fundamental version in the first place, and there wasn't much from western culture that could appeal to me at that point in my life.  This makes me think that western culture isn't really equipped to dismantle this type of radicalized ideology like ISIS.  When we hear of people leaving ISIS, it's mostly over internal issues like I ran into and becoming disenchanted.  The \"hey wait a minute\" moment.  It's hard to manufacture that.\n\nWhich is why I've long thought that probably the best tool for dismantling ISIS and other radical islamic movements would be fundamentalist Christian ones. Kind of ironic because I'm not really on board anymore, but still...  if you're dismantling an ideology that believes the world is temporary and you have to please the all knowing being by killing, maybe the best way is by saying \"actually the all knowing being doesn't want you to kill\" and having some scripture that they can stomach to back it up.\n\n"], [3, "Who would argue that you can't call them Muslims?

A happy, content person does not strap a bomb to his/her chest. A happy, content person does not run off to a war zone to join the cause.

Fundamentalism attracts those with deep emptiness and deep hardship in their lives, or those who cynically enjoy the benefits of a religion that elevates them in power over others (usually, because they feel powerless otherwise.) In order to fight fundamentalism, you need to eliminate the factors that allow it to take root. You need to fight the misery.\n\nWith many Muslim communities throughout Europe and even in the United States, there are no efforts to integrate them or welcome them into the citizenry. They live in these countries but are excluded from the opportunities offered to white, non-Muslim others. Prejudice prevents those who want to be a contributing part of the society from leaving their neighborhoods. As a result, these places become breeding grounds for resentment and misery--ripe conditions for a \"true believer\" to come in and preach a path to power and fulfillment. Even so, these fundamentalist recruiters only manage to convince a handful to commit acts of violence.\n\nIn places throughout the Muslim world, the lack of opportunity and the gap between rich and poor is even greater. In some countries, this is a direct result of Western meddling, such as the British exploiting the region for oil in the interwar period and after, and actions by the CIA to prop up Western-friendly but corrupt dictators. None of this is a conspiracy theory, it's historical fact. In these countries, you have misery among the masses that fundamentalists can easily exploit, pointing to an external enemy as the cause of their suffering.

When you have a hammer, and you're biased against nails, everything looks like a nail. He also just sort insults the intelligence of the people he sees that don't understand, but that isn't very helpful to us in understanding whats going on.\n\nI've taken classes on both Islam and Terrorism. The issue with terrorism is that every major religion in the world has had terrorists come from its ranks (including Buddhism). It isn't the specific religion that causes terrorism, its actually always politics underlyingly. By definition terrorism is about asymmetric warfare, about a power relationship between two or more sides, and therefore is political in nature. \n\nLet me differentiate though:\n\n***Act of Terror:***\n\nAn act of terror can be committed by one or more individuals for the purpose causing terror in a general or target populace. These sorts of attacks are usually fundamentally about untreated mental illness playing out. Think of the Colombine Shooters. They were in it for the effect, but had no really over-arching motive beyond that. They just wanted to do harm to people, some they didn't like and some just because they could. This is an act of terror.\n\n***State-Terror:***\n\nState-sponsored terror, should also be differentiated as states have been know to enact terror as a tool against enemies. War has often involved actions whose primary focus was terroristic. If the state commits the act themselves, we call it State terror, and if they simply sponsor it, as you might surmise, we call it state-sponsored terrorism. The difference here is that when states do it, its not about a smaller power trying to equalize power relationship, its just another tactic of war.  \n\n***Terrorism:***\n \nTerrorism is not merely an act of terror and ISIS is not a group that commits mere acts of terror. They are terrorists. They  ***do*** terrorism. This is to say they, as the weaker power in a relationship between powers, are using terror to cause psychological damage to an enemy population because more conventional warfare is not an option to them realistically (they don't have the man power, weapons, vehicles, expertise). \n\n***The Politics of Terror:***\n\nNow politics can be religiously focused. Churches, sects, creeds, etc. can and are political entities. The radical clerics that organize, radicalize, etc. for ISIS and other groups are religious figures and they use religious arguments to persuade their adherents. The fighters themselves view things through a religious lens and justify their actions religiously. However, the reason we know what their doing is primarily political is because A) the methods they use are political (terror as I mentioned is political), and B) the historical reason fundamentalism grew to be what it is today in the Islamic world, is because of political power. It was a push back, not only against the westernization that hadah24 talks about, but against western/soviet incursion/control. It would be like some other super power putting up a puppet government in the US, and then the more die-hard Christian Fundamentalists ousting them and taking over. That is a matter of politics, not religion. It just so happens a highly religious group took control. hdah24 is getting into the minds of the fighters themselves when he talks about how important Islam is to understanding ISIS, but fundamentally ISIS is more a response to a lawless, power vacuum left by Saddam, the US, and the Syrian government. It was an opportunity for a group to take over politically, and they took it. The average fighter's perspective, though important for dealing with issues like radicalization, tells us nothing about the real underlying reason any of this taking place. \n\nMy argument is that, while you should not disassociate ISIS with Islam, you also shouldn't assume that Islam is the primary focus either. It isn't. Its about power and control, which is politics. \n\nHe says here:\n\n>Some of those things have elements of truth - marginalization, poverty and retribution certainly are causes as well. Yet the biggest cause, above anything else, is their religious belief.\n\nThese things don't just have elements of truth, they core to why Terrorism happens everywhere it happens. What we would call ISIS is a 'weak-actor', that is a weaker power, whom is striking against a larger power. The reason they are weaker, is historical, economic, and sociological. Historically they dealt with western incursion (the CIA specifically), economically they are often deeply reliant on oil or other captured commodities, and sociologically they are living in incredibly unequal societies. These are the biggest reasons that fundamentalism took over, as each issue feeds into the other issues and lowers standard of living, education, etc. Happy populaces don't resort to guns, fundamentalism, revolt, and terrorism in a large way (there are always some kooks, as you might find in the US). You can say this sort of view is liberal and paternalistic, but I am not arguing they are not responsible for their actions, or that west should feel particularly responsible (except maybe the CIA, ha), or they know not what they do, or that pure ignorance is the biggest issue here. Factually, most terrorists tend to be educated, the same way most revolutionary organizers come from educated middle classes. Islam, specifically fundamentalist Islam, is their outlook and their personal justification, but nothing more than that. Beyond that lies the politics of power, history, and society in the Islamic world. The human mind can find justification for any action in any religion.  \n\n***TL;DR:*** ISIS is very much an Islamic group, but terrorism isn't a religious thing, its a political thing, and so to say that that the root cause of ISIS is religion, is absolutely not true.

Around the turn of the twentieth century the fear was Anarchists and then Communists, and then eventually radical leftist groups, before getting to the Islamist groups of today. There were actually more terroristic acts taking place in the 1960s and 1970s than there are now, but they were significantly less deadly. What has increased is the ease to which groups can get funding (oil money) and power of weaponry they have access to. They are getting better at terrorism, essentially. As to why its mostly Islamic right now, I think it has the most to do with money, the fertile nature of many countries where is a disaffected population (the middle east, parts of northern Africa now), and the way technology/travel allows ideas to spread. \n\nI think incidental part here is A) it just so happens fundamentalist groups took over after the western/soviet puppets were ousted (fundamentalists had the right appeals and the mentality), and B) technology and money make all of this possible. Fundamentalist Islamic groups were at the right place and time, to get the money necessary, the people needed, and the technology to spread their ideas. \n\nI don't think there is any argument to be made that countries with majority Muslim populations can't be contributing members of global society because of something inherent about Islam.

The conditions in Europe (particularly germany) between WW1 and WW2 were basically perfect for the rise of a toxic ideology. In early-mid 1900s Germany that took the form of Nazism, a pseudo-secular totalitarian ideology masquerading under the auspices of nationalism and socialism which latched onto theories of race and eugenics which were at the time popular around the world.\n\nThe development of radicalized islam as we see it today followed the same pattern but with slightly different specifics. We helped things along more specifically with things like the Irani revolution or arming and funding the taliban, and things were bootstrapped by the Mufti importing nazism and spearheading Arab League's repeated attempts to continue the Final Solution in the Mideast and wipe out the Jews. \n\nPlus there's a lot more individual factors like the aforementioned petrodictatorships, climate change driving ecological changes which force rural farmers into urban centers and create a large population of impoverished and often desperate people, western \"aid\" that makes things worse either by crippling local economies or by leaving portions of the population in the dust, that sort of thing.\n\nOverall however the general pattern of a large vulnerable population and an infectious toxic ideology which hijacks local dominant themes to its own end is the same. In Post-WW1 germany the dominant themes were eugenics and race theories. In the middle east post-WW2 the dominant themes were imported nazi anti-semitism, pan-arab nationalism (less of a thing now), and militarized/radicalized interpretations of Islam.\n\nInterestingly in both cases the Jews are seen as the ultimate root of all evil.

However, there is more involved than the factor of terrorism.

ISIS's ideology (their extremism) is strongly rooted in particular, fundamental, interpretations of Islam and the areas they control are governed in such a way that clearly reflects that; brutal, authoritarian, massively conservative, and given (alleged) justification by specific tenets of religious doctrine (the Quran, the Hadith or the judgements of later authorities (Imams)).\n\nTerrorism is, as you've pointed out, not limited to Islam or the Middle East.

Y'all don't study *faith* per se, do ya?  Take Catholicism, close to the 'true-est' still extant denomination of Christianity - text literalism isn't even real to them.  Even most staunch and dogmatic belief holds 'God made the world, god made the bible, if the bible doesn't agree with the world, we're interpreting the bible wrong.'\n\nAdaptive faith tenets and dogma are just as core to most major religions as believing in things or having odd rituals. *Text literalism*, rather than adaptation, is the newer 'invention' in most faiths I'm familiar with, though the specifics of Islam in particular I'm happy to leave to the experts.\n\n>The priest would tell us that Christianity preaches equality, freedom and love for everybody, including people from other faiths.

Religions **have never made logical sense**.  And the man telling you about peace and love and equality?  His job title is \"preacher\" and if he's saying it in his role on behalf of that faith, that is actually what that faith is 'preaching' because it's a damn tautology.

To truly assimilate requires giving up key aspects of the cultural identity that make a community unique. To keep those aspects requires a cultural separation from the main community.\n\nSeparating from the main community breeds a certain amount of quid pro quo distrust. The best example I like to use is the long history of the Jewish diaspora. I happen to have a tremendous amount of admiration for the Jewish community, and its ability to keep unique cultural and even racial characteristics alive over the course of 2000 years with no country in which they were a majority.\n\nBut the methods they used to do that - huge separations from the main community, pressures to intermarry within the culture, tremendous favoritism and support for each other within the tribe - naturally produced a reaction, the most extreme being The Holocaust, but hardly confined to that one event. I could name many many more who have experienced the same kind of phenomena, but that's the most well known example.\n\nSince the 60s there has been a global movement among Western countries to be more accepting of other cultures. This is primarily inspired by the horrible way the US has dealt with its African American community historically, and the attempts to correct this. Europe has long held itself as morally superior to the US because of a lack of problems along these lines, but it's been a false dichotomy. Europe consisted of countries mostly associated along homogenous communities, and when they weren't - most famously in the Balkans - there was often conflict.\n\nThe surge in Muslim immigrants is not a new phenomena. The issues associated with it aren't suddenly being brought up for the first time. I've been reading warnings on this for 20 years. The fact is Europe is not psychologically prepared to deal with a large minority culture in their midst. In many ways, unfortunately, they have been too tolerant, with the mindset that assimilation would naturally occur.\n\nHowever, the forces that create assimilation are often the very forces of intolerance and bigotry we have learned to despise in Western culture. People do not change without pain, as individuals, or as groups/organizations/nation states. The combination of tolerance and encouragement of these communities to be created in the first place, then combined with the resultant lack of opportunities to integrate because of the differences the communities created in their populations versus the mainstream, has created breeding grounds for some kind of way of striking back at the mainstream which doesn't consist of giving up parts of their core identity the way true assimilation would.\n\nWhat I would suggest is that what is going on is a natural outgrowth of allowing these communities to grow and flourish in the first place. Unfortunately, the only way to not allow these communities to grow and flourish, is to act in a way that is antithetical to our stated values in Western democracies, especially in terms of how we've tried to implement them since the '60s.\n\nWe're seeing the beginnings of a backlash, whether in the growth of far right parties in Europe, or the popularity of Donald Trump in the US, or the reaction to communities in the NYC area to Hasidic Jews. I would aver the reaction is going to get much worse, and of course, this will ratchet up the counter from the groups who end up being persecuted.

To keep those aspects requires a cultural separation from the main community.\n\nI would like to expand on your point a bit. While the evolution of a group is needed for assimilation, elasticity of the host identity is helps a great deal. \n\nLet's take the example of the US. You have White-Americans, African-Americans, Jewish-Americans, Latinos, Chinese, Koreans etc. In the US, there are a ton of cultural identities, that are different from each other, sometimes even very antagonistic to each other. But, due to history, all these identities are American. They call themselves American, and very rarely is it questioned. The American identity is elastic, and newcomers can make themselves a place within it. In a few generations, they see the US as their country. \n\n\nNow, in Europe, the countries are very homogeneous and so the identities are very rigid (History plays a role, too). As such, the identities tend to stay apart, and identifying with the host country becomes harder.

The indigenous population was annihilated by war, disease, the elimination of a chief resource, along with conquering their land and forced relocations. \n\nDifferent cultures brought in were subject to slavery, indentured servitude, widespread religious discrimination, and ghettoized. \n\nMy argument, and I find it a very unpalatable one, is that very oppression was in part responsible for assimilation to some degree. Immigrants changed their names, insisted on English being spoken in the home, and in various other ways insisted that the family \"was American now.\"\n\nWhile this was great for assimilation and integration, it's obviously not so great at keeping generations in touch with its roots. \n\nEven American Catholics were assimilated into the Anglo-Protestant culture to a significant extent, to the degree that American Catholics were considered in some ways a special culture by the Catholic hierarchy. \n\nI don't think this elasticity existed all that much at all, actually, until the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Catholic populations kept to themselves according to country of origin for the most part, whether it was Irish, Italian, Polish, Bavarian, etc.. \n\nI think it's fair to say the Catholic populations integrated with the Anglo Protestant culture they moved to, but it took generations, and a willingness for Catholics to subsume some aspects of their culture in favor of the country they now lived in.\n\nI think part of the integration which occurred with Catholics from a variety of countries, and why it happened with relative speed, was in part to create the best environment for their children - to provide for them the best way possible, as well as to create the best opportunities for them as they grew older.\n\nEven up to 1960 it was a huge issue, especially in southern states, to have a Catholic winning the presidency. There were fears he'd take his orders directly from the Pope, rather than keeping the nation's interests primary.\n\nThat seems absurd now, but it was a common belief at that time.\n\nWhen I used to work with diversity groups, one of the things we'd talk about is how many people from a different ethnicity/religion/culture do you have over for dinner on a regular basis?

It's a big deal.\n\nWhen I hear people tell me the standard phrase of \"oh, I'm not racist. I have x amount of friends who are black/gay/arab/muslim/etc..\" But when I ask them how many they've invited over to their home, the number is often much lower --- most often zero.\n\nHonestly, I think most integration by cultures doesn't occur because both sides learn more about each other. I think most integration occurs within societies when one group loses their identity over time in favor of the other. If that doesn't occur - if both groups choose to retain strong identifications with wildly different cultures - I think it's inevitable it will lead to tensions and conflicts as both groups fight for limited resources in different ways.\n\nAs far as Belgium, as I implied above, I think few people are mixing the pot in Belgium because Belgiums automatically assumed the immigrants would adopt their secular culture and values. When Muslims didn't, they turned out to be people Belgiums didn't feel comfortable being around, whether in school, in the workplace, or in their communities. Muslims, on the other hand, feel resentful because they weren't accepted for who they are. Opportunities have been limited. They live separately from non Muslim Belgiums. There's very little intermixing on any level. So they've grown to hate the community that hosts them. \n\nThat's the situation being repeated all across Europe, and now we're just starting the see the beginning of the consequences for that.\n", "id": "d1bhdwh"}, {"comment": "I just want to correct some of the things you said, even though I think you're right about the fact that Europe will not be able to handle the crisis that's going on now. \n\nIt's true of course that people who come to Western countries from other cultures have to adapt somewhat to integrate themselves, but I would argue that it's possible for them to keep up some of their cultural values and still be considered integrated. Modern western societies are already made up of different identities with different values and lifestyles. In fact I would argue that this kind of pluralism is one of the defining characteristics of liberal democracies. Conservative Christians in rural areas live a completely different life than, for example, gay people in big cities. The differences between Muslims and Non-Muslims might be even greater than that, but it's not an unsolvable problem per se. At least in theory, practically, it's a different issue altogether because for integration to really work, societies need to be much more open for it than they are today in the West. \n\nAnd I think it's not true that Muslims have more problems integrating into Western societies than other people. I'm German and we have a big Muslim population, especially from Turkey, and while there have been problems with the integration process, most of these people live harmoniously with the rest of the population while still upholding their own identity. And the problems that have arisen out of this situation are mostly not due to Muslims being unable to adapt, but more about the fact that politicians have handled the integration process very poorly, especially in the last decades of the 20th century. \n\nI also want to correct your assessment of German antisemitism at the beginning of the last century. The growth of antisemitism was not just a reaction to a separate and strong Jewish identity, in fact, beginning in the second half of the 19th century, Jews became more and more assimilated into mainstream German culture. And it was this process of integration or assimilation (as it was called back then) that sparked a new rise of antisemitism, since people were afraid that these integrated Jews had some hidden agenda. It was a huge reason for the rise of the kind of racial antisemitism that ultimately lead to the Holocaust. Many Jews considered themselves Germans at the start of the 20th century, many of them converted to Christianity, many fought in the First World War and were proud of it. This successful integration was one of the big reasons why many Jews did not want do emigrate during the Third Reich, they felt at home in Germany, they felt that this was their country too. They could not imagine that the Germans, whom they perceived as their countrymen, would seriously harm them. Victor Klemperer, a German Jew who converted to Christianity, who fought in WWI and became a German nationalist after the first war, wrote in his diary during the Third Reich that the Nazis were the biggest allies of the Zionist cause (which he despised) by turning the Jews that had become Germans into Jews again. He wrote this half-jokingly but of course he was right, as is also evidenced by the fact that the Nazis worked together with Zionists from Palestine in the early days of the regime to try and send the German Jews to them. The British refused. \n\nIn the 19th century there was, btw, a public debate in Germany, called the Berliner Antisemitismusstreit, that was very similar to the debates that we have today about Muslims and integration. People thought that Jews could never fully integrate, that they were incapable of assimilating into German culture because they would always remain first and foremost Jews. It is actually really scary how similar these debates are, you can take some of the articles from back then, substitute Jews with Muslims and you'd get opinion pieces that you could publish today in a conservative journal.\n\nBut in the end, I do agree that this whole problem, the refugee crisis, terrorism, the huge reactionary backlash that's going on right now in Western societies, will probably end very badly. Many people thought that we were ready to build true multicultural and pluralistic societies but they are wrong, sadly. I'm afraid that this situation will explode in the next few decades and I don't see what we could do about it.

Protestant reformation is \"new\" compared to the larger scope of the history of religion.  The Abrahamic faiths track their ancestry & history back thousands of years, and five hundred years ago is treated as fairly new, in spite of how absurd that may sound.

When in fact text literalism is something that has been finding growing mainstream appeal and acceptance in modernity compared to 'authentic' or traditional forms that are generally not text-literal and also were not in antiquity. \n\nPeople with agendas in faiths have always tried to tie their opinions to \"pure-er\" interpretations of scripture.

It's not 'a point' to just cite some dude's fiction like their plot devices somehow constitutes argument and support for how things are in the real world.  Orwell writing a fictional universe where absolute government control & its perpetuation were merely a plot device to allow critique of the methods of control specifically doesn't not constitute a credible argument for real-world power structures being self-perpetuating even if that very point has other credible evidence for or against it.  \n\n>There are different ways of communicating and novels tend to have a timeless quality that scholarly works don't have - \n\nScholarly works also have some timeless quality that novels don't have - mainly, scientific and predictive validity alongside hard claims that can be tested.

Or maybe the fact that they have no hard claims, based on substantial evidence, discussion, and interpretation ... leaves them 100% open to interpretation from day one so it's much more acceptable to just force interpretation on a work of fiction than on an academic artefact that needs to be contextualized to the time, place, and culture from which it originated. \n\nIt's not that their figurative nature makes them immune to time.

Don't be silly.  If you think it said something relevant, why not say *that* and then try and argue for it yourself, rather than just making a claim and backing it up with \"Orwell said it so obviously pure truth\".  If you wanted to cite some social sciences paper that's a real credible predictive source talking about real societies with real data and some peoples' academic and professional reputations backing that ... Yeah, I can take that at pretty close to face value because its real evidence delivered credibly that the thing you're claiming has truth.  But a novelist said something one time in a book?  Don't matter how great a novelist or how great a book, fiction is not a citable source for how the real world is.  \n\n>Not true.

Earlier in this very comment you were arguing that it's logical to take a book literally because the book wants to be taken literally and sanctions critical thought.  Now you're saying it's mental illness?  Those two things are mutually exclusive almost by definition alone.  \n\nIf the two things you claimed were responsible for radicalism were actually as responsible as you said they were, absurd shit would happen.  To explain why absurd shit doesn't happen, everyone who's ever taken a religious text literally is apparently a 'radical thinker' (wtf do you mean by that, btw?) with psychiatric issues.  How convenient.  \n\nOr maybe making a bunch of vague pseudointellectual claims about the root causes of violent religious extremism is really not taking a serious topic seriously enough and forcing a running argument hunting for semantic corners where what you said is still 'right' is kinda silly?  \n\n>We can dive into all sorts of details, but this ignores the very simple mechanics of radicalism, which most people ignore.\n\nThe whole point of our conversation specifically and the larger conversation throughout this post is that radicalism is not simple.

First of all, any study of any religion will show that religion is always full of people who don't actually follow the letter of the law.  Modernity has likely increased this to some extent (as in modernity has let more temptations in, like more alcohol into Muslim countries and more sex into Christian ones), but it's a historical constant.  See Mark Chaves address when he was president for the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (the main association of psychologists, sociologists, and political scientists who study religion) called, \"Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy\".  Here's the abstract:\n\n>Religious congruence refers to consistency among an individual's religious beliefs and attitudes, consistency between religious ideas and behavior, and religious ideas, identities, or schemas that are chronically salient and accessible to individuals across contexts and situations. Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research establish that religious congruence is rare, but much thinking about religion presumes that it is common. The religious congruence fallacy occurs when interpretations or explanations unjustifiably presume religious congruence.\n\nTo assume this is unique to Islam, or some how particularly conducive to violence, is absurd.\n\nBut more, it assumes that fundamentalist Muslims are some how inherently violent (As a sidetone: oh how I hate the word fundamentalist--it comes out of a specific debate within American Presbyterianism in the 1920's and has come to stand in for \"religion we don't like\".  If it's related to some sort of Biblical inerrancy or truth, well then I'm a fundamentalist Jew and I like to think I'm a pretty reasonable, non-violent guy). Fundamentalist does not mean violent.  There are tens of millions of Fundamentalist Christians in America (well, if we pay attention to the difference between Fundamentalist and Evangelical they're not, but I don't get a sense that this person understand that difference since, to them, everyone who tries to follow the words of scripture appears to be a fundamentalist).  There are also of tens of millions of non-literalists Christians (and Muslims) who don't seem to have the problems that /u/hdah24 (I'm just going to use \"he\" from now on, sorry if you're a woman) assumes are inherent.  \n\nHe says: \n\n>Fundamental Islam IS incompatible with Western-style liberal democratic society.\n\nwithout any evidence.  Evangelical (to /u/hdah24 fundamentalist) Christianity has also been a major pilar of American democracy since 1980.  \"Fundamentalist\" parties (if we include Shas) often make up almost 1/3 of the seats in Israel.  Christian Democrats, who are often the major conservative party in Latin America and Catholic Europe, started off in a way that I'm sure /u/hdah24 would describe as fundamentalist.  The Al Nur Party in the Egypt election was a Salafi party, and they weren't an inherent threat to democracy.  There are plenty of religious parties in Indonesia's democracy, and I'd guess most that a majority of Indonesian would say that the Quran and the Hadith are literally true and that people should live by those codes.  Religious people can be Democrats as well.  To argue that all \"religious codes are outdated\" is kind of silly, when the vast majority of Americans are religious and have been since the founding of this great nation.  Even today, atheists and agnostics are relatively rare.  To quote an older post of mine:\n\n>There are four types of \"religious nones\" that show up in survey questions: atheists, agnostics (both self-ID), and \"nothing in particular\" which can be subdivided into \"religion is important\" and \"religion is not important\".  If we include the atheists plus the the \"nothing in particular-religion not important\" and the atheists and agnostics, in the Pew Religious Landscape Survey we end up with about 10% of Americans in 2007 and 16% of Americans in 2015.  Of those, 4% were atheist/agnostic in 2007 and 7% were atheist/agnostic in 2015.  Those are probably smaller numbers than you expected, first of all, but they're fairly consistent.  If you look at a different data set, like the General Social Survey (which goes back to 1972), what you see is a pretty steady rise from about 5-6% \"nones\" (no stated religious affiliation--including people who have no stated religious preference but think religion is important).  In the GSS data, we don't pass 10% \"religious nones\" until the mid-1990's, though in the 2014 survey the religious nones passed 20% (the Pew survey had 23% total nones in 2014).\n\nSo clearly we don't need secular voters for democracy, even if we do require a government that is open to both secular and non-secular voters.  What about the claims about religion and violence?  Let's just take Salafism, what most people mean when they say \"fundamentalist Muslim\".  Most Salafis aren't terrorists.  Most Salafis aren't violent.  There are generally three groups of Salafis you see in the academic literature: hakkari (activist, like the al Nur Party in Egypt--they got about 20% of the vote), quietist (who eschew politics and were long the dominant group, though there's some sense that it's changing), and jihadi (the group of Al Qaeda and ISIS).  There's no great survey data on these guys, but every scholar would agree that jhadis make up a minority of Salafis (whether hakkaris or quietists dominate depends on the country--in Egypt, hakkaris, in Morocco, seemingly quietists).  Now, there were violent Salafis around 1800, who occupied Mecca and Medina and created the First Saudi State (the current one is the third), but then they mostly disappeared for several decades and weren't really representative of Salafis and other literalists Muslims elsewhere.  Anything like contemporary Jihadis really don't show up until the 1980's.  We don't even see Islamist militants in *Palestine* before the 1980's--Islamic Jihad was founded in the early 1980's, Hamas in the late 1980's, and for the decades before that most Palestinian terrorism was led by secular leftists.   If *any* of /u/hdah24's analysis is right about fundamentalist Islam and violence, surely we'd see it more strongly before the 1980's, right?  But we don't.  I mean, you could push it back to 1979 maybe, and earlier than that in a few places (Islamist violence takes off in Egypt in the 1950's for example).   We also expect to see the most Islamic violence in the most modernist Muslim countries, like Albania and Turkey and Azerbaijan, but against we don't.  \n\nThis is just ahistorical hokum masquerading as a historical analysis.  It just happens to be several paragraphs long.  All that he's right about is that we need to understand that ISIS and Al Qaeda are rooted in Islam, but we shouldn't see the average Muslim as a terrorist ([more on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/4bjr6z/the_silver_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/d19y5d1?context=1), but those are mostly quick, off the cuff remarks).

There is a causal story to be told, but the evidence suggests that it's usually people end up as \"losers\" (nowhere jobs, trouble with the law, social isolation, etc) and then turn to extreme forms of religion for meaning, not they see the hypocrisy of how others find meaning. This pattern I lay out explains Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the three Charlie Hebdo shooters, the shoe bomber, and several others who've led attacks on the West (though certainly not all of them).

[This piece](https://aeon.co/essays/why-isis-has-the-potential-to-be-a-world-altering-revolution) is especially good. \n\n>All of the European political imports and even nationalism itself (except maybe for Turkey, Egypt and Iran, which are still more built around ethnicity and faith than national identity per se) have failed in the Middle East, and miserably so. People are longing for something in their history, in their traditions, with their heroes and their morals; and the Islamic State, however brutal and repugnant to us and even to most in the Arab-Muslim world, is speaking directly to that.\n\n>Yet the US and Western powers don\u2019t seem to recognise that revival. The hackneyed solutions amount to a tired call to shore up the broken nation-state system imposed in the aftermath of the First World War by the European victors, Great Britain and France, and a reaffirmation of \u2018moderate Islam\u2019, which appeals to young people\u2019s longings for adventure, glory, ideals and significance even less than does the eternal promise of shopping malls.\n\n>Still, the popular notion of a \u2018clash of civilisations\u2019 between Islam and the West is woefully misleading. Violent extremism represents not the resurgence of traditional cultures, but their collapse, as young people unmoored from millennial traditions flail about in search of a social identity that gives personal significance and glory. This is the dark side of globalisation. Individuals radicalise to find a firm identity in a flattened world. In this new reality, vertical lines of communication between the generations are replaced by horizontal peer-to-peer attachments that can cut across the globe.\n\n>As I told the UN Security Council this spring, what inspires the most lethal assailants in the world today is not so much the Quran or religious teachings but rather a thrilling cause and a call to action that promises glory and esteem in the eyes of friends. Foreign volunteers for the Islamic State are often youth in transitional stages in their lives \u2013 immigrants, students, people between jobs and before finding their mates. Having left their homes, they seek new families of friends and fellow travellers to find purpose and significance.\n\nThis quote from /u/hdah24 is really odd:\n\n> If I believed that the world was going to end and I had to obey the law of the all-seeing, all-knowing, all-powerful deity in order to reach eternal paradise, I'd do whatever the hell was needed to get on his good side. If that means killing people, why wouldn't I? This world is just a temporary, physical one. It's worth it for infinity in paradise. And they are non-believers anyway, they know nothing.\n\n>If that is how you see the world and that is how you understand it, then these acts of violence make sense. The whole Islamic State makes sense.\n\nThis line of reasoning is often repeated in the West but is it actually what happens?  Atran's research has showed that that is NOT how people who join ISIS or or other groups view things.  In fact Atran writes that after interviews with several jihadi leaders, every one of them [told him](https://evolution-institute.org/article/here-he-goes-again-sam-harriss-falsehoods/) \"that anyone seeking to become a martyr in order to obtain virgins in paradise would be rejected outright.\"  [His article here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jul/19/terrorism-radical-religion) explains the actual reasons that these people become violent.  \n\nViolence, and extreme violence in particular, should be seen as a political tactic, not some crazy, hard-for-us-rational-people-to-understand method to appease Allah.  \n\n> \"Brutal terror scares the hell out of enemies and fence-sitters. ... Asymmetric operations involving spectacular killings to destabilise the social order is a tactic that has been around as long as recorded history. Violent political and religious groups routinely provoke their enemies into overreacting, preferably by committing atrocities to get the others to drive in the sheep and collect the wool.\"\n\nIt is trivially true that ISIS is an Islamic group.

Because it's in \"vogue\". Because it's the easiest way to gain sympathizers, given the turmoil in the region and frequent Western escapades over the past century. Because of the trouble faced by youth all over the Middle East thanks to Western-backed dictatorships. And so on.\n\nMost crucially, people seem to overlook the fact that what IS is doing under the banner of Islam could have been done for any other religion or political or social cause. If that other religion or cause was much easier for troubled youth to sympathize with than Islam, extremists would have used it without hesitation.\n\nSo the way I see it is that it's not a question of who is Muslim and who's not, but rather why Islam and what are their political goals as a group.", "id": "d1a52o8"}], [{"comment": "Something in what this guy says is off but I'm not knowledgeable enough to spot it.\n\nIs his point that the fundamentalists are following the true word of the scripture and the moderates aren't?

I grew up in a more moderate setting, met some people who were more serious about their faith, read through the bible, and I suppose in a way I ended up \"radicalizing\" myself. Cost me a few years of life, I lived like a hippie, started prayer groups and worked for homeless shelters.  I think I accomplished a fair bit of good during this time of my life. \n\nMy worldview at the time was similar to what he describes.  I saw this world as temporary, a clear and seemingly obvious way to eternal paradise, so who wouldn't want to trade a temporary world for an eternal one?  What difference did it make if I had a career, for example?  Wouldn't God provide anyway?\n\nWhat changed my worldview in the end was being hurt by people I trusted.  It seems small but it created a situation I couldn't resolve in my mind.  People I recognized as \"real Christians\" turning against me over petty things.  I couldn't say they weren't \"real Christians\" but \"real Christians\" are a family... so how do I deal with them? Then I prayed for divine intervention... to have God change their minds or intervene in some way and the prayer wasn't answered and I had another dilemma. If the prayer wasn't answered then perhaps I expected to much. But if I expected too much what should I expect?  Well, I never figured out the answer, so I left to do other things with my life, then got tired of the question.\n\nIt was a combination of the desire for higher purpose and the estrangement of moderate Christianity from the scriptures that edged me toward a fundamental version in the first place, and there wasn't much from western culture that could appeal to me at that point in my life.  This makes me think that western culture isn't really equipped to dismantle this type of radicalized ideology like ISIS.  When we hear of people leaving ISIS, it's mostly over internal issues like I ran into and becoming disenchanted.  The \"hey wait a minute\" moment.  It's hard to manufacture that.\n\nWhich is why I've long thought that probably the best tool for dismantling ISIS and other radical islamic movements would be fundamentalist Christian ones. Kind of ironic because I'm not really on board anymore, but still...  if you're dismantling an ideology that believes the world is temporary and you have to please the all knowing being by killing, maybe the best way is by saying \"actually the all knowing being doesn't want you to kill\" and having some scripture that they can stomach to back it up.\n\n", "id": "d1a98fr"}, {"comment": "> best way is by saying \"actually the all knowing being doesn't want you to kill\" and having some scripture that they can stomach to back it up.\n\nI think that political violence can find justification in any religious ideology.

I usually don't like to explain human behavior by looking back at our primeval nature or something like that but the fact is that until very recently, violence played a huge and prominent role in our societies. It still does, but it is either a tamed version of it or it is happening at the margins, behind closed doors or in other countries that we exploit economically. The problem with this is that people, as I've said, to some extent crave adventure, violence, danger. It makes life intense, it's empowering. That's why we love violent movies and videogames, that's why we love to hack things into pieces. It's a very real longing with many people and it doesn't really matter that they mostly have unrealistic and romanticized expectations when it comes to stuff like war and violence. \n\nI think that this is part of the reason why some European Muslims, who grew up in the West, find ISIS and other extremist organizations so attractive. At least that's one of the psychological reasons why people want to join. Compared to the stuff that goes on in Syria and in Iraq, life in the Western world seems unreal and fake. Over there, they can be \"real men\", they can be warriors. Of course, when they get there, many of them realize that they just made a huge mistake, but then it's too late. \n\nYou can see parallels to this in the euphoria that broke out all over Europe and especially in Germany at the beginning of WWI.

A happy, content person does not strap a bomb to his/her chest. A happy, content person does not run off to a war zone to join the cause. People who enjoy the benefits of western civilization are not drawn to fundamentalism. Fundamentalism attracts those with deep emptiness and deep hardship in their lives, or those who cynically enjoy the benefits of a religion that elevates them in power over others (usually, because they feel powerless otherwise.) In order to fight fundamentalism, you need to eliminate the factors that allow it to take root. You need to fight the misery.\n\nWith many Muslim communities throughout Europe and even in the United States, there are no efforts to integrate them or welcome them into the citizenry. They live in these countries but are excluded from the opportunities offered to white, non-Muslim others. Prejudice prevents those who want to be a contributing part of the society from leaving their neighborhoods. As a result, these places become breeding grounds for resentment and misery--ripe conditions for a \"true believer\" to come in and preach a path to power and fulfillment. Even so, these fundamentalist recruiters only manage to convince a handful to commit acts of violence.\n\nIn places throughout the Muslim world, the lack of opportunity and the gap between rich and poor is even greater. In some countries, this is a direct result of Western meddling, such as the British exploiting the region for oil in the interwar period and after, and actions by the CIA to prop up Western-friendly but corrupt dictators. None of this is a conspiracy theory, it's historical fact. In these countries, you have misery among the masses that fundamentalists can easily exploit, pointing to an external enemy as the cause of their suffering. It's no coincidence ISIS has taken root in the very places destabilized and then abandoned by Western forces. We left behind hell--someone preaching heaven through revenge becomes very attractive in those places.\n\nIf we can send in the armies to take out the extremists, great.

I mentioned I'm in pharmacy school. I have a future rotation set up with a psychiatric pharmacist that I've had a lot of chats with. Unfortunately, our understanding of the brain is sooo fucking rudimentary. Our discovery of medications has mostly been \"Huh, that randomly worked\". Compare that to other medications for other parts of the body. We can test drugs on animals better for other things because we can objectively see if the drug improves the health outcome. \"Oh this improved the mouses blood sugar.\" Compare that to like schizophrenia. How do you even model that in a mouse? How do you know your drug is working? How do you know what other mental side effects there are?\n\nYou don't.\n\nSo you have to test on humans, but because we as a society have ethics, testing on humans has a ton of limitations. We can't chop open our brains, for example. Etc. etc.\n\nCombine that with the fact that modern neuroscience is what, 30 years old? So we have a long way to go.\n\nBack to that psychiatric pharmacist, she said something that kind of stuck with me. At this point, with how basic our knowledge of the brain is, psychiatric pharmacy is more of an art than a science. We have a bunch of options and we have to see what does the most help while minimizing the most harm. Drug A may make you feel really tired and may not help your depression that much, drug B may kill your depression and give you migraines and an inability to get a boner, Drug C may give you anxiety attacks. and not taking any drug except maybe a xanax as needed may be the best option of the bunch. \n\nIt's tricky as hell and I really feel for the people who can't be helped by what medications we currently have available. \n\nI think this is something important to be addressed as well, because I think a huge problem mental health treatment has is the perception of it. And I want to be clear to acknowledge that it simply won't work for everybody because I know some people where it doesn't work for them they'll get on facebook and spout off about how medication is bad and awful, and such a thing may prevent someone from getting treatment that may in fact save their life.\n\nSide note, one of the most interesting things learning about all this kind of stuff and neuroscience is for me is it really really shows how much of the world is a shade of grey.

I've come across people who share your line of thought before. It kind of makes me think about this time with my mom (she had depression, killed herself 10 years ago) just before she died. It was about a month before she died, she had been getting maybe 4 hours of sleep, just always seemed super energetic (anxiety), was always a worrier but was like... supremely worried about nothing to worry about, etc. At one point I said \"mom, you're acting very strange, what's up?\" and she kinda snapped out of it for a second and seemed like her normal self for a little. She told me something along the lines of \"I know my minds acting off. I know I seem crazy. I know it's not me, I just can't get a handle on it.\"\n\nThen she killed herself, then I felt guilty and all kinds of horrible etc.\n\nI read a line in a book that stuck with me. Kurt Vonnegut's *Galapagos*. Context. A main character's husband had brain cancer. He was acting insane, thinking it was a different year, hallucinating, was anything but himself. His wife basically already thought her husband was gone. He laid on his death bed and in that moment kind of sounded like himself again:\n\n\u201cI'll tell you what the human soul is, Mary,' he whispered, his eyes closed. 'Animals don't have one. It's the part of you that knows when your brain isn't working right. I always knew, Mary. There wasn't anything I could do about it, but I always knew.\u201d\n\nThat line hit me hard. It reminded me of that conversation with my mom. It allowed me to separate the part of my mom that was who she was and her disorder. It helped me heal immensely.\n\nMy mom, who she was without her disorder, was someone who would have never killed herself. So yeah, I wouldn't really fault the idea of considering it a broken brain.\n\nAlso, thinking of my brain as broken allowed me to sort out which parts were me and which parts were my brain lying to what I considered me. It helped me a lot. It also seemed to be helping a lot of people on that original post a lot as well. Shrug.\n\nWith that said, though, I know there are people who have incorporated dark and depressed attitudes into both their personalities and identities. That's fine. I don't consider them broken. I don't demand happiness from everyone. But part of the diagnostic criteria for clinical depression is that the depression is impairing your day to day life. If it's part of your identity and you don't consider yourself broken, then you straight up don't have to be diagnosed with it. (So long as you handle your shit in your day to day life so to avoid getting forced to see a doctor.)\n\nHell that's probably something that should be done more often.

There are types of positions (for example, blocked ones like in the game /u/argh253 mentioned) in which humans usually perform better than computers, but the gap in performance in such positions used to be way, way more skewed in favor of humans - computers nowadays have a better understanding of such positions and handle them better than they used to, though it's still far from perfect.\n\nAnother issue chess engines have had is that their calculations have a horizon - that is, they can only calculate a position to a finite amount of moves of depth. Nowadays this isnt much of an issue anymore with the sheer power that professional chess programs will use (or having it utilize several processors at once), but it used to be a large problem for computers and still is for some weaker amateur programs or when they are playing a speed chess game in which they only have 1 second per move. \n\nBasically, what the horizon entails is that for every extra move of depth that a computer calculates, it has to look at an exponentially increasing amount of possible moves that might occur to cover all the possibilities. This means practically that a chess engine, if it can look at a certain position for 10 seconds, can evaluate what happens 8, 9, 10 or 11 moves deep and judge the arising positions accordingly (this might look like little, but it still means that it is processing millions of chess positions in a few seconds time).\n\nThe problem is this: sometimes a computer looks 11 moves deep, but there is a 12-move combination in the position. Because the horizon of the computer is at 11 moves, it won't see the end result of the combination and will act as if it doesn't exist or doesn't work. This is also why chess computers, when compared to humans, tend to be described as materialistic: they cant judge long-term pawn sacrifices or piece sacrifices very well, because the implications of such sacrifices might only become clear for the computer 20 or 30 moves further on (though again this problem used to be worse, and nowadays there are several programs - or settings within programs - that are much more carefree with sacrificing material).", "id": "d0xayrm"}, {"comment": ">I had to battle the notion that computers categorically outperform humans (and that's why fighting game AIs are \"dumb\") in the old Street Fighter 4 subreddit, and it eventually led to me unsubscribing.\n\nLink please?", "id": "d0yuxjw"}, {"comment": "Not sure why someone downvoted you (I've upvoted you to compensate), but [this was the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SF4/comments/xgpuv/is_it_possible_to_create_a_perfect_or_nearly/) that finally did it for me.

The code and the software is the same thing.\n\n\nI disagree wholeheartedly. While you can consider the human mind a product of the human brain and therefore make comparisons to a compute program, you cannot compare having consciousness to not having consciousness. In what way is my car, then, different than you? If I strip away all its internal parts, it no longer can fulfill the requirements of being a car just as you can no longer fulfill the requirements of being a person if I strip out everything under your skin -does that mean a car is a conscious, sapient being like you because I can draw that parallel?\n\nThe software absolutely has no consciousness. It isn't \"creating\" anything, it is following a list of rules set down by a man. Now, one day, we may well create consciousness within a computer albeit it might be helpful first to figure out what *human* consciousness is, as we really have not yet accomplished even that.

They simply make a program for learning, and let the program learn for it self by looking at different paintings by Rembrandt.\n\nI really recommend that you read up on neural networks and machine learning, because you will be amazed by what it can do.

A layperson probably would not recognize this for what it is, whereas a critic/historian mostly likely would. So is it therefore not art because the more qualified, objective opinion is that it is not?\n\nI wouldn't even call myself an amateur critic/historian -- my knowledge is very limited -- but I find myself always returning to the idea that art is about context. Without knowing the context of a piece, it is nearly impossible to make a determination whether or not it is art. But is it fair to say that the context matters more than the work itself?\n\nI recently thought about this a lot with the release of Bowie's album Blackstar.

For as many people who view art there are that many opinions on it.\n\nAnd we have those opinions for the same reason we make that art -we are conscious beings who interpret our experiences. Did you grow up in a factory family and see mass production as soulless? Did you grow up in a wealthy family and see mass production as a financial means to an end? Were you parents killed by a can of soup falling from the twin towers? Whatever your subjective experience, it will inform your subjective experience of art or your motives for creating that art. \n\nAnd art doesn't need to inspire emotional responses.

Hopefully I can express what I'm thinking, words can be very inadequate when trying to describe things like thought. When you were a toddler, you saw an unshaven homeless man stare at you with black eyes and you were frightened. It's a primal image for you, something experienced while your nascent mind was forming, as your consciousness was emerging. You're not even truly aware yet -you're young enough to still think that if you throw a blanket over your head no one else can see you. So this image bores deep down in you and comes back to you from time to time. You are unwittingly influenced by it whenever you encounter homeless people, view art containing similar images, meet an unshaven man -it's subtle and arises in many ways. For very many things, whether impactful or mundane, your mind creates abstractions to represent things to you. It's how we make sense of life and they are subjective. I didn't have your experience with the homeless man thus scruffy beards don't subtly bother me. \n\nBut the computer program is not having experiences and it is not creating abstractions to understand its world.

If I have it right, your working definition is roughly:\n\n1. The spontaneous, unprompted creation\n1. of a sapient being (not a Rube Goldberg process)\n1. expressing some element of their personal, inner experience\n1. that resonates (e.g. emotionally) with humans\n1. as a result of the piece's artistic properties\n1. that were deliberately chosen.\n\nLet me know if I have that more or less right.  Right now, I think #4 and #5 are being handled by computers just fine - we've seen DeepMind produce some startling and interesting pieces that were completely unexpected, using styles that are genuinely novel (I'm thinking of those fractalline pastiches of image fragments).\n\nCriteria #1, #2, and #6 are really tricky, in large part owing to human bias. There a lot of people that will simply never admit that an artificial thought process has 'agency'. There's always a causal thread back to a programmer somehow, but the fact that humans can't perceive the formation of their own motives makes them sufficiently mysterious that we give them a pass. I might be homesick, pining for the outdoors, or feeling curious about chess strategies, but other than post-hoc explanations the mechanisms that lead to one or the other are completely inscrutable. Into this rarely acknowledged blind spot, we've inserted ideas like *agency* and *will*, whereas, when it comes down to it, it really might just be random gyrations of some atoms.\n\nComputers, on the other hand, are built out of parts that we've chosen, so it's tempting to refuse to grant them corresponding agency. The thing is, while we understand the building blocks of neural networks, it's not fair to say that we understand the emergent architectures that form within neural networks - there are emergent properties that surprise us.\n\nEven once AI starts to eclipse human brain power (which is only decades away), we'll still be telling ourselves that AI is \"just a Rube Goldberg\" machine - and brains somehow aren't. These aren't fair to include in a definition of whether a computer is making art.\n\nI think #3 is far more interesting. Computers, right now, aren't really having meaningful inner experiences that humans could relate to. This is because AIs now are all special purpose programs, meant to solve specific problems, like Chess or Go. Within very narrow areas, they are by all accounts performing creatively (Kasparov said about Deep Blue II, \"I sensed an alien intelligence in the program,\" and AlphaGo made several moves that stunned onlookers, who described them as \"beautiful.\")\n\nNevertheless, these programs have no other aspect to their experience. Kurweil reckoned that Deep Blue II had about 3% of the computational power of Kasparov, but it beat him because it was fully devoted to chess, while Kasparov could only devote some tiny fraction (perhaps 3%?) of his brainpower to chess.  Accordingly, computers can't possibly compete with Kasparov across the breadth of human experience because there's just not enough computing going on.  These milestones, however, aren't as far away as they might seem.\n\nOne reason is that we tend to make [linear assumptions](http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png) about the progress of computers, but computers aren't growing in power linearly.  It's taken us sixty years to get from ENIAC to trouncing humans at Go, but we still laugh when robots trip on doorways. As long as that's still happening, it's easy to miss that it only takes a decade for chips to get ten times more powerful.  But the rather sobering implication is that it only takes the that same, 70-year span for computer to grow from 'nearly as smart as a person' to 'as smart as ten million people'.\n\nThat seems like an awful lot of room for inner experience to arise.", "id": "d1tx8lr"}, {"comment": ">Let me know if I have that more or less right. \n\nI'd say yes.\n\n>I think #4 and #5 are being handled by computers just fine\n\nAh but I argue that unless the computer can determine what would resonate with viewers I don't think it's accomplishing those because of 3; expressing some element of their personal, inner experience.

If I hand a computer a list that contains \"sad clown, lonely boy, dying man, lost puppy\" and mark them \"sad symbols\" just because the computer selects one when I say the \"paint a sad picture\" command doesn't mean it knows those symbols or could have chosen them without the list.

I am saying they currently lack those parts.\n\n> But the rather sobering implication is that it only takes the that same, 70-year span for computer to grow from 'nearly as smart as a person' to 'as smart as ten million people'.\n\nAgain, smart =/= conscious. \n\n>That seems like an awful lot of room for inner experience to arise.\n\nI think if we give computers the parts they need, the ingredients of consciousness, then it *will* arise but right now we are still learning how all our parts work and how to reproduce those parts artificially. Baby steps. Making a computer that can beat Kasparov is easier than making a computer that can genuinely feel and ask you why you built it without being programmed to.\n\nBut there's a middle ground we haven't even reached yet.\n\nHave you noticed that your computer or \"smart\" phone is \"smart\" enough to collect your private data and send it off to third parties, to glean your location from your search history, to generally sketch a reliable profile of you from your activities -but it can't choose to help you complete your tasks?\n\nI love to 3d model. I hate to UV map, however. pain in the ass tedious sometimes. But I'm really sitting there straightening 200 UVs one line at a time -it's a simple enough pattern. Why can't my computer deduce that I have 184 more lines to go and ask if it can just finish it all up for me?\n\nTHAT'S the AI I'd like to see as a next step. My computer is excellent at helping corporations and governments to my information for their wealth and power but it isn't so interested in helping me complete the tasks I bought a computer for. I think when AI is starting to really get somewhere, we'll see things like that begin to come with operating systems.

Thanks for your considered reply.\n\nSome time ago, I read an article about space probes and how they were coded - in the past, there were hundreds of thousands of lines of if/then statements to deal with various contingencies. But of course, that amount of logic is vulnerable to logic errors, sometimes catastrophically.\n\nIn one case, a probe decided that its main communication dish had failed. In fact, it hadn't, but the sensor responsible for determining if it was working was the problem. Not knowing this, the probe switched to its backup dish - which HAD failed.  (Communication was eventually restored through various heroics.)\n\nAnyways, apparently this old model was replaced by a different one, where the probe had a little software model of itself and all of its features. When a symptom arose, it can run a 'solver', structured more like a chess-solving program or search algorithm than, to create a series of prioritized hypotheses about what might explain it.  It can then propose experiments to verify these hypotheses, which in turn it can prioritize in terms of their risk.\n\nThis is neat and sophisticated, but's much less code than the old style of reams and reams human-curated logic, and much more reliable.\n\nAnyways, what I find interesting about this is that this seems like a first glimmer of self-awareness - albeit a trivial form that nobody would consider conscious.

One of the abilities is a special \"ultimate\", for which you build charge by dealing damage to enemies or healing allies.\n\n## Lack of scoreboard\n\nThere is no scoreboard in the game. You don't earn points and nobody on your team can ever see how many kills you have or how well you're doing. This is done intentionally to combat toxicity and prevent players from feeling bad about themselves.\n\n## Medals and gameplay mechanics\n\nYou get given medals (gold, silver bronze), which only you can see, for damage done, eliminations and objective kills. You get the gold medal for damage if you did the most damage on *your* team.\n\nSome heroes have the ability to produce shields or walls with very high hit points to protect their team, and damage done to these shields or walls counts towards the damage total, meaning damage done is often a misleading stat. Furthermore, some heroes are fuelled by damage because they gain ultimate charge by healing people, or they get powered up when their shields are damaged. You often get people claiming they were carrying their team because of their gold damage medal, but that person might have been spamming grenades for high damage without getting any kills, and this would actually help the enemy by giving them ultimate charge.\n\nTo get an elimination you need to have done damage to an enemy recently, even a small amount of damage. So someone spraying a machine-gun like weapon at long range who is absolutely no threat might get the gold eliminations medal, just because they've \"tagged\" every enemy as being recently damaged, so that when someone else kills them, they get credited with an elimination.\n\nAnd since you only see your own (absolute) values for damage or eliminations and never anyone else's, you cannot compare it or get a sense of perspective.\n\n## Cards\n\nAt the end of a match, up to four players from either team get a card pointing out something they did well at, such as getting most eliminations, most damage, or most healing. In many cases, you are guaranteed one of these if you play a certain hero.\n\n## Genji\n\nGenji is one of the heroes who throws some throwing stars at people, and has high mobility, so he jumps around a lot and is hard to hit. His \"Q\" ability refers to his ultimate (which is activated by pressing Q). It makes his sword very powerful so that he can kill people in 1-2 hits, and often results in him killing many people. Some people are \"Genji mains\", meaning they primarily play Genji.\n\n## Reinhardt\n\nReinhardt is a hero who projects a large shield to protect his team. His shield is very easy to hit. A Genji who \"pokes ineffectually at Reinhardt shields\" would be someone just firing his throwing stars at Reinhardt's shield, accomplishing very little.\n\n## Lucio\n\nLucio is a hero who heals his allies. He does this just by existing - literally every ally around him regenerates health if Lucio is in sight. For this reason, he nearly always gets the card for most healing at the end of the game, and some people might consider themselves good Lucios because of this.\n\n## Junkrat\n\nJunkrat is a hero who fires grenades. The grenades do high damage, but not enough to kill someone in one hit. It is primarily untargeted spam, and most of it will do damage to shields, or be healed, giving the enemy healers ultimate charge, meaning not only did he not help, he actually hindered his team. Junkrat nearly always gets the card and medal for most damage, and if you criticise him, you bet he will point it out.\n\n## Hanzo\n\nHanzo is a \"sniper\", but with a bow and arrow. In playstyle he often ends up being similar to Junkrat. Projectiles in Overwatch are very forgiving, and will hit players and get headshots even if they missed. You just have to get the projectile near them. So Hanzo will spam arrows and then one will hit and he'll get a kill and he feels good.\n\n## Tracer\n\nTracer is the fastest hero in the game. She can teleport a short distance, and when she presses E she teleports back to a previous location with her previous health. This makes her hard to kill.\n\n## No sense of failure\n\nOverwatch takes away nearly anything that could tell you that you're doing bad, or tell other people that you're doing bad. Even the ranked mode, where you earn points for a win, will not tell you how many points you got. And when you lose, it doesn't even show the animation for the number changing.

This is good if you want to know how well you're doing, but also bad because people can be shitty to each other online if they see a teammate not doing as well as them or if someone on the enemy team wants to tilt/flame them.\n\nOverwatch has been built to mitigate anti-social behaviour like this from the ground up by removing anything that allows you to attack others based on their performance through numbers.

Jeff says it himself as much in [this interview](http://kotaku.com/overwatchs-director-on-competitive-controversies-and-1783869335):\n\n> That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on now, making players feel better about where they\u2019re at.\n\n> We really want Overwatch to feel safe and inclusive and very positive and bright.\n\nYou don't feel good if you have numbers that the other players can see that tell you and them that you're doing badly. It's even worse when you're losing badly and your teammates are looking for any excuse to divert the blame to. Overwatch never has that problem because it never gives you the opportunity to do so to begin with, and cuts out a potentially huge source of toxicity as a result.\n\nWhich brings us back to OP and my explanation. Scoreboards are a dual-edged sword that give as much as they take, and Blizzard decided that striving for a feel-good factor across the board was better than what information could be gleaned from one.\n\nHope that helps, even if it wasn't exactly ELI5!

They are people who play Akali and roam the enemy jungle looking for kills when they're doing well, instead of trying to help their team, push towers, or close out the game. In League of Legends, a Hecarim that gets every lane ahead early will end the game 4th place in KDA because their teammates are doing well too.\n\nIn League of Legends, the game is often less about winning and more about making sure that you can find someone else to blame for the loss. It's about figuring out who to scapegoat before the rest of the team decides to scapegoat you. And the scoreboard gives you plenty of information that you can use to pick which teammate to blame. In League of Legends, when you're losing the game, the scoreboard helps the solo glory player determine which team-oriented player to blame.\n\nThe phenomenon of people thinking that they are better than they are is always going to exist, and I'm fairly confident that it exists in every game. There will be people in every team game that has a ladder who will say that they are better than the ladder indicates.

That doesn't even begin to touch on other issues I care about.\n\nAlso, for what it's worth, I don't watch liberal media, let alone *any* news media.

[He supported beating up a BLM protester.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-black-lives-matter-protester_us_5651ea96e4b0258edb31dd7e)\n\nThat's with 20 seconds on Google. That's also not touching his infamous claims of all latin@ people being rapists, which I could go on about for a while.\n\nIf you don't believe he's a racist, you're the one jamming your fingers in your ears. There is nothing he has done that has shown he is not racist. There is no false claims of racism here. If you are retweeting white supremacists who have usernames on Twitter like \"End White Genocide\" - this is a real thing that has happened, more than once - you're a racist.\n\nFlat out, I do not care what that video says, there is nothing you can say that counters his inability to stop being so fucking racist, even for just five minutes.\n\nBut let's dismiss the racism for a moment. Let's pretend that's not a problem. Why would I still not support him?\n\nThe most pressing concern in politics to me, after their stance on minorities, by far, is the welfare of the poor. Anyone who unironically says \"small loan of 1 million dollars\" is so far out of touch with even the upper-middle class that they cannot possibly understand the struggles of those who are five dollars away from homelessness for a third time in their life. I cannot, in good conscience, vote for someone who is so disconnected from reality. A million dollars is not a small loan, christ, that's triple the size of the average mortgage in the USA, the largest loan 99% of people will ever get in their life. I cannot support someone who is that clueless.\n\nI've weighed the whole argument. There is nothing on his side of the argument other than xenophobia. Believe me, I'm more politically aware than you think. I am willing to believe I'm wrong, because then I could stop being the weird dude who refused to vote in Canada because no one was left-wing enough for me. Nothing I have seen so far has been remotely convincing.\n\nSorry for dunking on you so hard.\n\n-edit-\n\nOh, and should I go into his thoughts on LGBT people?

It would almost be better to ask someone who really hates the Roma why they hate them.\n\nBut anyway, I'll try give explanations. Firstly, the Romani people are often seen as criminals. Beggars and street criminals are some of the most visible Roma in much of Europe. Even in Australia I've had people give me long rants explaining that racism against Roma people isn't really racism because their aunt went to France and got mugged or some similar story. Most Romani populations are incredibly poor, and in big cities they're often displaced from their traditional way of life, so there are a lot of Roma petty criminals, and so a lot of peoples only experience of Roma people is through begging and theft.\n\nAnother reason is that, because gypsies are nomadic, they've never got along that well with settled people: they'd set up camp on someone's farm, or too close to some village, or in a forest claimed by some medieval Lord, and of course this would lead to tensions.\n\nThe Roma also have several of the stereotypes associated with Jewish people associated with them: they're seen as unscrupulous and greedy. Look at how the Irish travelers are depicted in the movie Snatch, for instance, or think about American 'carny' stereotypes (Roma people did actually historically run fairs and carnivals and similar things, and they still do in some places).

The more either was treated as separate, the more they made themselves separate as a matter of defending themselves.\n\nThere's a good argument to be made that Roma isn't even an ehnicity anymore in many European countries but a socioeconomic class originally loosely based off ethnicity (this does not apply to the Balkans or Romania, but rather specifically Central Europe). Since their language isn't spoken whatsoever anymore, most haven't been nomadic for decades if not centuries (starting with some good old Habsburg poverty laws and population engineering in the Age of Enlightenment), they have had forced schooling for at least several generations (although purposefully subpar), and even though we don't see it, there had been a history of desire to assimilate as well throughout various points (but was usually beaten out of them by strict housing segregation). They've been treated differently for centuries originally due to their actually very different lifestyle, but in Central Europe the lifestyle of the wandering Gypsy caravan doesn't exist in living memory.\n\nAlso, while we are on it, with regards to Jewish \"tribalism\", in going to quote Nietzsche,\n\n>It is certain that the Jews, if they desired--or if they were driven to it, as the anti-Semites seem to wish--COULD now have the ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT working and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the \"wandering Jew\",--and one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country.\n\nIf you have ever had experiences or knowledge of Jewish culture in Budapest, Vienna, or Prague, you'd know that, unlike Eastern European Jews who were forcibly kept isolated in rural areas and had pogroms be a constant factor in their lives (or Western European Jews who had been expelled centuries ago and were pariahs when seen in public because of that), Central European Jews were treated quite well. They had access to opportunities to a similar level as non-Jews, they were able to be officers in the military, join the ranks of the aristocracy, become academics, had the freedom to choose what their professional lives would be and most expectation that they'd get to practice (or not practice whatsoever) religiously as they want, and were quite often very urban. They had a great deal of positive push to assimilate that they themselves were happy with generations before the increased anti-Semitism of the post WWI, something many Central European Jews were greatly and genuinely surprised by. They didn't have just negative push forced upon them out of self-preservation, as is often imagined to have been the case in much of European history. In these countries, what it means to be Jewish more often than not has a very different meaning than it does in other European countries. To most of them, they had and continue to see themselves as being Jewish second, and Hungarian/German/Czech first. What challenges this perception for them, however, isn't really anything with a desire to keep themselves separate, but rather the pervasive fear that they would never be truly accepted for their Jewish background and treated as fellow members of society. Being someone who belongs to this group, I can quite confidently tell you that any sort of \"tribalism\" the descendants of the Central European urban Jews have of being Jewish is entirely due to the experience and knowledge that we *will* be thought of and treated as different no matter what lifestyle we live and no matter how harmoniously we have integrated into the full arms of the society we inhabit.

The difference is that stationary groups eventually learn about shared values, how to coexist and to mingle (or, in some cases, one group annihilates the other). This is extremely hard with gypsies; it happens here and there, but it's the exception to the rule. \n\n> in Central Europe the lifestyle of the wandering Gypsy caravan doesn't exist in living memory.\n\nThe isolated gypsy caravan has disappeared, sure; they now move in large numbers from place to place, settling for a few years here or there until local attitudes reach breaking point (which may or may not be their fault - often, the same behaviour can generate very different reactions depending on socioeconomic conditions of the host country that are completely unrelated to gypsies). At least this is my experience in Italy and France. This lifestyle makes some things easier (coordination between local authorities and clan chiefs) and some things harder (their impact on land and people is overall much higher) than it would be if they were spread around in smaller units. It's also seen as incoherent -- the larger the camp, the longer the settlement, the more people start asking why they don't just renounce (or be forced to renounce) most of their diversity.\n\n> Central European Jews were treated quite well. [...] any sort of \"tribalism\" the descendants of the Central European urban Jews have of being Jewish is entirely due to the experience and knowledge that we will be thought of and treated as different no matter what \n\nI agree that historical experience and tradition inevitably reinforce certain tenets. There is, however, a set of Jewish customs that are definitely tribal, starting with the definition of who can call himself a Jew. That is probably inevitable for a culture that started forming more than 4000 years ago, but it's definitely there: a link between culture and blood that would horrify in any other \"Western progressive\" setting, but which is an inevitable part of Jewishness. (It's also something a bit hard to accept rationally, considering it was exactly that sort of link that the Nazis insisted on, exploiting it to its fullest.

In most developed countries, minors cannot work nor be forced to beg, and must go to school. This is not a brainwashing exercise - school is where minors can also be monitored for health problems and overall wellbeing, removed from familial interference. \n\nThat's incompatible with what most gypsy clans expect of their minors. There is a constant charade where a gypsy kid will go to school a day or two, after much bargaining between authorities and his family when the camp arrives; and then he will disappear. The police is legally forced to intervene in these cases, so they will eventually show up at the camp but clearly nobody will know where the kid is. The kid will eventually be found begging or thieving, and the circle will start again. \n\nThe host country is ultimately supposed to accept that gypsy minors are not subject to laws protecting them and regulating their activities. It's a situation that often results in a reality of abuses, and perpetuates a state of poor educational attainments that inevitably have all sorts of long-term repercussions. It will also perpetuate bad perceptions, since the classroom is where young citizens start to learn about equality, diversity, coexistence and so on, and so they'll quickly convene that the gypsy element is just a constant troublemaker.\n\n(Now, there are exceptions to this state of things; and the more a camp stays still, the more local authorities can have a dialogue, the more kids actually go to school... but that tends to negate the whole nomadic thing altogether, so sooner or later will come to an end.)\n\nOf course, this sort of thing is not exclusive to gypsies; but where other groups can be dealt with in the long term (if the political will is there) through constant dialogue, this is made extremely difficult by the nomadic element.\n\n>  all other manner of things to make a nomadic lifestyle live-able.\n\nI don't know the numbers in the US, but in Europe at least, gypsies move in significantly large numbers that wouldn't be satisfied with a couple of coin--operated showers - they don't settle for a night, they settle for months or years. They usually operate by buying cheap land for cash and setting up a camp, building some precarious structure. Local authorities are then forced to intervene, because of health concerns, pollution concerns, complaints from locals about rising criminality and so on. The camp is then provided with water and electricity, again on health grounds, and social workers start talking to families and chiefs. \"Successful\" camps keep growing for years until they become untenable (or until the locals threaten to riot), at which point they are either broken up or evicted altogether. In the best scenario, camps become permanent but don't grow, which means long-term normality can be attained and improvements can be made on all sides. Inevitably though, someone will raise the issue that gypsies are not respecting this or that law and relationships will sour again.\n\nNote that this happens in densely-populated areas.

The country that most had the persecuation and extermination of their Gypsy population was specifically modern Czech Republic. Not even Czechoslovakia, that is, the Slovakian part was mostly spared. The modern Czech Republic is really the only country in Europe that truly had its Gypsy population mostly obliterated, everywhere else they were killed in massive numbers as well, but only in the modern Czech Republic did they have almost none Gypsy population left by the end of the war. So it's a matter of visibility in that sense as well, more people in more countries experienced the disappearance of Jews from the country than they experienced that with Gypsies.\n\nYou could also easily go into the fact that Jews were visibility persecuted in more Western European countries than gypsies ever were, partly because there have always been less gypsies in Western Europe than Central Europe. So it's also highly due to the fact that you're either a Western European or an American (which mostly understood the Western European experience of the war) and these countries just didn't have the personal experiences of witnessing Gypsy persecuation at the same level, which is highly important for how history was recorded and understood for us later on.\n\nIn Central European countries, people are significantly more acutely aware that Gypsies were persecuation during the Holocaust as well. So what seems to you to be a lack of awareness of that is simply due to how your culture understands these experiences, but that doesn't whatsoever reflect how other cultures know it.\n\n\nLastly, there is a great amount of prejudice that still exists towards gypsies in Europe, but in all honesty that can also be said of Jews. I think this is less of a factor than people here think it is on why we don't hear about the Roma side of the Holocaust. Countries where the Holocaust happened have either tried relentlessly to educate their citizens of what happened, which means that gypsies are appropriately covered there, or it's become somewhat of an awkward thing to bring up in polite company due to how solemn it is, in which case people still know about it for both Roma and Jews but the knowledge is more focused on the local experience of the Holocaust rather than the grand scheme of it. The latter means that it's still dependent on whether that country has a significant experience with the Roma Holocaust or not (and places like France and the Netherlands simply do not have that the same way). Also in the latter case, you'll find more people in those countries who simply do not talk about or want to learn about the Holocaust (not at all all people, or necessarily a majority either, dependent on the country), which makes them ignorant of both the Jewish add Roma experience, which ironically means much of what they know about the Holocaust is from the media, which is highly influenced by American perspectives....\n\nMost Central European countries are a combination of those two, only in Eastern Europe (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine) is the latter is closer to being fully true. Germany is known for being the former.\n\nUltimately, I think the key reason is because you're American or Western European. The Holocaust didn't happen as much there, and therefore the understanding of the history of the Holocaust in shared conscience is much more due to arbitrary factors of exposure. America and Western Europe had some immigrants who were Jewish come from other parts of Europe, but that is less true of gypsies.

If they could have made 3 separate designs they would have, but officials knew congress would not okay three separate planes, so a joint program was initiated. \n\nThe F-35 is slated to be the work horse of the USAF-- the closest comparison to maybe the F-15. It is meant to be in service through 2060 at a supposed total cost of 1.5 trillion dollars in the next ~50 years. While it is certainly capable of air superiority like another commenter mentioned, it is meant to fill other roles as well, such as a general purpose ground attack air craft. The F-22, with ~200 air craft in service, is meant to be the main American air superiority fighter. \n\nThe F-35 has completely new avionics and electronics packages. Things like network integration which allow F-35 sensors to immediately talk to other F-35's to share data and information on targets, friendly locations, etc. Theoretically, this will allow the F-35 to eventually do super fancy stuff like control unmanned drones. It also means the F-35's programming is rather complicated and prone to bugs. \n\nThe F-35 is expensive and has plenty of problems. In aircraft development we've seen time and expense exponentially rise over time. The more complicated something is the more problems it will have. However, the aging US air frames are also expensive to maintain and continue supporting-- standardizing is supposed to be cheaper in the long run --this may or may not turn out to be true.\n\nAt this point, the F-35 is too big and too important to fail at becoming effective.

The F-22s would make missile shot calls before the instructors in F-15s and F-16s even knew they were there, let alone what direction they were coming from.\n\nThe thing is, you don't learn anything really by calling \"FOX 3\" at 25 miles away and then turning around and going home when training. To improve the F-22 pilot's skills and base of knowledge they will intentionally put them in positions that they would never seek, things like being within visual range with two enemy fighters on their tail and see how well they can cope.\n\nThe \"LULZ F-35 is teh suxx\" factoid you're probably thinking of is a turd one of the outrage-farming bloggers plopped out about an F-35 testbed being defeated by an F-16. The point of those tests were to put the F-35 in a terrible position (low airspeed and high angle of attack) and see how it performed. The fact that the AoA the F-35 was flying at couldn't even be attempted by an F-16, which has a hard AoA limiter to keep it from going into an unrecoverable deep stall is never mentioned. You don't *want* to be in a dogfight on the backside of your power curve but what they were testing was what IF you end up in that position in an F-35. And guess what? They found out that the flight control laws in place in the F-35s computers didn't allow for aggressive enough maneuvers for the pilot's liking. They'll take information that and use it to improve the jet's capability.", "id": "d2sujc2"}, {"comment": "To elaborate on the F-35 vs F-16 \"dogfight\":\n\nThe F-16 is an energy fighter -- it excels at keeping its energies up in a sustained turn, so its method of dogfighting (to put it very simplistically) is to out-turn the other fighter -- you can imagine two planes trying to turn circles into each other, and the F-16 will have its nose facing its adversary first after several circles. \"Getting on the enemy's tail\" and all that.\n\nLater planes such as the F-18 can use a somewhat different method of dogfighting. Rather than turning circles, they do a quick snap around to face the target, thus putting the plane at a high angle of attack. The advantage is that you get your nose on your target much faster, giving you the first shot. The disadvantage is that you're at a high angle of attack, so the whole bottom of the plane is facing the direction of the air, so you lose speed (i.e. energy) very quickly. At the end of the maneuver, then, you're going a lot slower, so you better have made your kill, since the other plane (if he didn't get hit) still has a lot of energy that he can use against you. One of the disadvantages of the F-18 is that although it can do this type of dogfighting, it regains energy slowly when slow; although it has two engines, they're relatively weak, so it takes a while to recover from this. By contrast, the F-35's engine is reputedly good at recovering energy in a slow state, so it will be able to recover much more quickly after such a maneuver compared with the F-18.\n\nThe test was about exploring the F-35's performance in this high AoA regime. The F-16 can actually enter into a deep (unrecoverable) stall at high AoA, and hence its flight computers automatically limit it to 25 degrees AoA or so -- it is simply not allowed to use this tactic, unlike later planes. The F-16 was simply there as a maneuvering target, i.e. so that it's not simply the pilot pulling the stick back \"hey I'm in high AoA, how fun\", but he has to be thinking about trying to face a target, and quickly. What the test found was that the plane was perfectly fine (structurally there were no issues) and it stayed in control. However, the flight control software was artificially preventing the plane from turning around quickly. The F-35's flight control engineers were worried about the plane going out of control -- like other modern aircraft, it's a very unstable platform -- and had set the parameters very conservatively to ensure the plane stayed in a very predictable, very controllable regime, especially since the plane is still in development. There have been a number of high-profile crashes with modern aircraft simply due to the pilot + flight control software interacting to make the plane go out of control, such as [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faB5bIdksi8), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iToQ2FykoI), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yVU_yYtEc), and they wanted to avoid that.\n\nThe problem is that this method of dogfighting relies on the plane being able to turn and face the adversary very quickly. The important factor here is not just being able to go high AoA, but being able to go from low AoA to high AoA very quickly; in other words, to have a high pitch rate. Yaw rate is another consideration. So the test report talks about how the pilot was frustrated that the F-35's rates were slow and/or unpredictable (unwieldy), not because of the plane's physical characteristics, but because of how the software flight control laws were controlling the plane based on the pilot's input. Well if the pitch rate is too slow, then you can't turn your nose on target quickly enough and you lose your opportunity to take your first shot, which means this method of dogfighting wouldn't work.\n\nSo the pilot's recommendations were to loosen the parameters, since the plane was structurally fine and it wasn't in danger of going out of control. As a loose analogy, this is like letting your car hit a top speed of 120 mph instead of 100 mph (most cars' top speeds are electronically limited these days). The significance of this test is that the test data allows them to go to the flight control engineers and say [\"okay you don't need to be so worried about the plane going out of control, it handled just fine\"](http://aviationweek.com/defense/f-35-flies-against-f-16-basic-fighter-maneuvers) and let them work with how much to loosen the software parameters. The natural outcome of this is that the F-35 will be more maneuverable and will be able to add this tactic to its bag of dogfighting tricks once those software changes are implemented.\n\nIt's not the F-35's only way of dogfighting, of course, it's just one potential method. In a real dogfight, what would most likely happen is that the F-35, being able to detect the enemy first due to its stealth, would be able to maneuver onto the enemy's tail even before he knew the F-35 was there. It also has [high-angle off-boresight \\(HOBS\\) capability with its missiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g4_jzqBJnA), meaning the plane's nose doesn't have to face the target for the plane to fire a missile at it; the pilot simply turns his head to face the direction of the target, and the plane will automatically instruct the missile to head in that direction (so the missile does a hard turn right after being launched). So it doesn't really need to turn its nose to target, except to use its gun. Even if it does need to point its nose to use its gun, the *combat-loaded* F-35 is relatively \"slick\" and low-drag compared with other *combat-loaded* planes; by carrying its weapons internally, it doesn't have the drag penalty that other planes have when they're carrying weapons (and obviously, if a plane goes into combat it's carrying weapons -- but usually in these comparisons people compare them \"clean\" i.e. with nothing hanging off the wings). There's also all sorts of other stuff like altitude, speed, working in formations (in the future, an F-35 will be able to launch missiles from *another* F-35 or other plane, if that missile has a better chance of killing the target), etc. This is just one way to dogfight.", "id": "d2t6dhi"}, {"comment": "> The \"LULZ F-35 is teh suxx\" factoid you're probably thinking of is a turd one of the outrage-farming bloggers plopped out about an F-35 testbed being defeated by an F-16.\n\nIn my defense, I formed my negative opinion of the F-35 in high school, and I don't read aviation blogs.

There's also a cottage industry of people who literally make their living by writing negative sensationalistic clickbait outrage articles about the F-35; it's easy to form a negative opinion of the F-35 if all you do is read clickbait articles without looking at the source material they're using and considering for yourself \"do the arguments presented in the articles actually make sense\".\n\nBy most accounts the F-35 program was a disaster up until around 2011 or so; basically it was failing to meet most program and performance parameters. [They sacked the previous program manager](http://www.dodbuzz.com/2010/02/01/gates-fires-jsf-program-manager/) and eventually put in Bogdan, who still leads the F-35 program currently. They re-baselined the program around 2012 and since then it's pretty much been on-schedule and on-cost. For example, when the program started, they originally planned for the Marine version (F-35B) to reach IOC (Initial Operating Capability) in 2010, the Air Force version (F-35A) to reach IOC in 2011, and the Navy version (F-35C) to reach IOC in 2012. After the re-baseline, the new targets became Marines in 2015, Air Force in 2016, and Navy in 2018, which is what the program is meeting to this date.\n\nSo how good or bad you think the F-35 program is doing depends on what you use as your baseline for comparison: the original program metrics or the ones since the re-baseline. If you use the original one then the program is about 5 years late and billions of dollars over budget. If you use the one since the 2012 timeframe, it's been on-time and on-budget.\n\nIt may be useful to compare how the F-35 program compares with other fighter programs. In that case, the program actually ends up being very much *average*; most modern fighter programs have tended to initially target 10 years for development but actually take around 15 years to reach IOC. France [announced the Rafale program in 1987 with a target date to enter service of 1996](http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/06/21/france-decides-to-build-own-advanced-warplane/6526e315-4e0b-4c5b-8ed5-c8e52790f20c/), and it [actually reached IOC in 2002 with the Navy version](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/french-navy-accepts-rafale-184093/), with the Air Force version two years later. The Eurofighter Typhoon [started full development in 1988 with planned service date of 1997, but it actually entered service in 2003](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/eurofighter-chron.htm). [Lockheed won the F-22 contract in 1991 with IOC set for 2001](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/f-22-program.htm), and it eventually IOC'ed in Dec 2005. Sukhoi won the contract for the PAK FA in 2002, just one year after Lockheed won the F-35 contract, and after 15 years, something like 12 prototypes have been built and it's currently scheduled to start deliveries around 2017 after repeated delays. Compare this with the F-35 where around 200 have been built and it has already IOC'ed with the Marines.\n\nCost-wise, the media widely reports that the F-35 program will cost $1.5 trillion. Some will even say that [it costs a trillion dollars *per year*](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/21/sorry-saga-f-35-when-pentagon-wastes-money-all-get-vegas-hangover.html). If you look at the F-35's [official Selected Acquisition Report](http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Reading_Room/Selected_Acquisition_Reports/15-F-0540_F-35_SAR_Dec_2014.PDF) though, it turns out that the cost is really the overall total cost from the beginning \"paper analysis\" in 1994 all the way [out to the year 2070](http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/2016/03/24/f-35-fly-until-2070-six-years-longer-than-planned/82224282/), **including inflation**. About $1.1 trillion of that is by including operating and support costs (fuel, salaries, training, maintenance, spare parts, etc.), again including inflation out to 2070. Pretty much *no* other program is being reported in this way; they only include the development and procurement costs when they report \"total program cost\", but will *exclude* the operating and support cost from consideration. For the F-35, around $380 billion of that $1.5 trillion is actually in development and procurement, so that's the program cost that should be compared with other fighter programs.\n\nNow, $380 billion is a lot of money, but most of it is actually going toward buying the planes -- the cost is high simply because there are so many planes. The program is projected to spend around $320 billion buying 2457 planes over the next ~25 years. All this includes inflation. It will spend around $60 billion in development. Keep in mind that the F-35 is meant to replace multiple planes: F-16 for the Air Force (replaced by the F-35A), AV-8B Harrier for the Marines (F-35B), and F-18 for the Navy (F-35C). Some would also include the A-10 for the Air Force as well. While $60 billion is expensive, consider that the B-2 took around $20 billion to develop in the 1990's, and the F-22 took around $36 billion to develop in the 2000's. If you think $60 billion in the 2010's is expensive, you'd have to argue that separate development programs to replace the F-16, the AV-8B, and the F-18 (and possibly the A-10) added together would have been cheaper, considering the development costs of the B-2 and F-22. (Yes, I'm aware that a RAND report tries to do so.) Basically, the development cost is high because it effectively replaces the development cost for multiple plane programs, plus with so many planes projected to be built, it makes sense to spend more on development costs now to save on the volume later.\n\nIn terms of the procurement cost, here it really depends on what metrics you use. People like to say that the F-35 is a lot more expensive than what it was originally planned to be. Well, it was originally estimated to cost around $30-50 million or so. Nowadays, you can't even get a 4th generation plane like the F-16 or F-18 for that kind of money (they're in the $70 million range), nor 4.5th generation planes like the Rafale or the Typhoon (around $80-100 million). The F-35 will come in at around $85 million each, which means it will basically cost about as much as current 4.5th generation planes, but with 5th generation capabilities (stealth, sensor fusion, situational awareness, etc.). If I estimate that next year's iPhone should cost $10 each, is it really Apple's fault for not meeting my projections?\n\nFor performance, there's so much garbage written about the F-35, it's really important to look at the source material and make your own judgment instead of taking an article's conclusions at face value. You should ask yourself *\"what aren't they telling you?\"*, such as \"how would other planes perform?\" and \"what are the conditions and assumptions they used?\" This is because there are a number of bloggers who literally make their living by writing negative clickbait articles about the F-35, and other media outlets will just pick up and re-post those articles without doing their own independent checking. For example, you may have heard that the F-35 would lose to an F-16 in a dogfight; that's based on a blogger taking quotes from a test report out of context and then claiming the test was about the two planes dogfighting, when *the report's own first sentence* said the test was to check out the F-35's software control laws. You'll have things like Tyler Rogoway -- in [arguing that Canada should buy the Super Hornet rather than the F-35](http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-right-fighter-for-canada-is-the-super-hornet-not-t-1587492909) -- argue that the F-35 isn't fit for Canada due to its vast arctic expanse, and talk up how the Super Hornet excitingly gives a 35% range increase over Canada's current Hornets, while omitting that the Super Hornet *on internal fuel plus 3 external fuel tanks* has a [combat radius of 489 NM](http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Reading_Room/Selected_Acquisition_Reports/FA-18E_F-SAR_31_DEC_2011.pdf), while the F-35 *on internal fuel alone* has a [combat radius of around 614 NM](http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Reading_Room/Selected_Acquisition_Reports/15-F-0540_F-35_SAR_Dec_2014.PDF), 25% greater. Or they'll cite a 2008 RAND report that says simulations show the F-35 would be blown out of the sky by Chinese Flankers -- while omitting that in those simulations the F-22s were blown out of the sky as well (the author basically assumed so many Flankers that after the U.S. planes expended their full load, there were still enough Flankers left to kill the U.S. planes), and that the \"simulations\" were literally Excel spreadsheets with input parameters like \"# missiles per plane = 6\" and \"% chance of missile kill = 50%\", *not* an actual air combat simulation.\n\nThe media will report things like how the F-35 ejection seat has additional risk for too-light or too-heavy pilots while omitting that *all ejection seats have similar weight restrictions*, or that it has software issues, *which all modern airplanes have*. Recently it reported on Michael Gilmore, Director, Operational Test & Evaluation, saying that the F-35 has only a 25-40 minute loiter time for CAS missions while the A-10 has 60 minutes, up to 90 minutes with external fuel tanks. It turns out that he used the F-35**B**, the Marine version, which has 5,000 lb less fuel and is 3,000 lb heavier than the F-35**A**, the version the Air Force uses, and the version that would be replacing the A-10.\n\nI could write a 10000-char post about each of these, but basically, the F-35 program isn't as bad as the media makes it out to be. That doesn't mean it's good, either, just that it's about what you'd expect for a U.S. fighter program: very expensive, but with a transformational leap forward in capabilities and tactics.", "id": "d2u0a3d"}, {"comment": "I think you just wrote a depthhub meta post...\n\nBut seriously, this is great information, thank you.

I always thought of it as a fatass that couldn't possible outperform an F-16, or F-18E, but I guess that isn't the case.  It's actually mind boggling that they can pack as much technology, payload and performance into a single airplane, not to mention its cross-branch versatility.\n\nThis thread has changed my opinion of the program and why we need these planes, so I appreciate all the thoughtful and thorough posts from people like you.\n\nThanks", "id": "d2u143r"}, {"comment": "8.5+ years behind schedule and hundreds of billions overbudget.\n\n> It may be useful to compare how the F-35 program compares with other fighter programs.\n\nIt's strange.

How the F-35 can carry what?  4 air to air missiles in a clean, stealthy configuration vs what?  8 for the F-22?\n\nAnd the F-35 people absolutely will never under any circumstances entertain a comparison of, for instance, what if any time in the past ~20 years, for instance, if, in 2011, there had been a honest, modern design to compare the F-35 against.\n\nThe two obvious examples would be a single engine evolution of the F-22, which, to some extent, the F-35 is, but this theoretical design wouldn't have the F-35's baggage.  Mostly baggage from the marine F-35B jumpjet.\n\nAnd then the other point of comparison would be an entirely clean sheet design.\n\nF-35 people love comparing the F-35 to the F-16.\n\nBut then they don't stop there.  They go even further.  \"What if you took the first production F-16 that came off the line in 1970, and maintained it continuously until 2065?\"\n\nThat's a comparison they really really love.  It turns out strawman arguments like that sound really really good to laymen.\n\nAnother one they like is, \"What if you compare a run of ~20 new build F-18s to ~2,700 F-35s and you ignore the fact that this comparison only shows A: that the F-18 has two engines, and B: economy of scale, and it shows absolutely nothing about the F-35.\n\nPersonally I like the lift fan a lot.  But I strongly think that the marines should have their own lift fan jet without any of the baggage of the JSF program.\n\nNow, what was the experience with the F-4, and, to a lesser degree, the F-15.  Is a navy/air force jet a good idea?  Maybe.  Maybe not.\n\nThe whole idea behind the F-35 program was to have very low development costs by sharing a lot of the technologies of the F-22.  Sharing a derived engine, sharing the same software, in fact, using the same radar and RAM, along with the same software.\n\n>Nowadays, you can't even get a 4th generation plane like the F-16 or F-18 for that kind of money \n\nStop.  This is completely, utterly, and totally dishonest in every way.\n\nShow me a legitimate quote for a production run of 2,700 F-16s.\n\nThen you can make that argument.\n\nIf you can't, and instead, try to compare a run of 2,700 F-35s to a run of ~37 or whatever TWO ENGINE F-18s...  You can fuck right off.  Nobody's going to listen to anything else you'll ever say about the F-35.\n\nYou're sort of right about the media.  It's very easy for the media to take a report that says \"X went wrong with Y program\" and turn that into a few column inches.  And, at the same time, if anyone ever wrote a report about the F-35 that said \"The F-35 doesn't have any flight restrictions, the F-35 can fly through it's full regime with it's weapons bay closed the whole time, there's no problem with the helmet that is 93% fatal on ejection for pilots under 145 lbs, the radar works 100%.

Etc. etc. etc. etc.\"\n\nLet's say, \"10 of 10 air force real world alert interception tests were successful\".\n\nThat would be a hard story for a blog, or a news program, or a newspaper or magazine to publish.

A super hornet's combat radius with, I assume, no external tanks is 390nm.  Canada would be concerned with AA interdiction missions, so they'd probably be carrying 4 aim-120s and 2 aim-7s, which would probably extend their flight radius (as well, I suppose, as that of the F-35).  The 3 tanks only give it an extra 100nm?\n\n>all ejection seats have similar weight restrictions\n\nI thought the restrictions on the F-35 were due to the heavier than normal helmet.\n\nThe A-10 when it was introduced had 120 minutes loiter plus ~45 minutes reserve iirc.  I suppose it's gotten new toys, but with smarter weapons it's typical payload has probably gotten a lot lighter, and it can probably do a lot more with less.  Two APKWs pods and some external tanks and, of course, ~10 times the 30mm ammunition where each round is more than twice as powerful as a round from the F-35, not to mention that the air force would never let anyone batshit crazy enough to do a ground gun run in an F-35 within a mile of any F-35.\n\ntldr, I think the F-35 is basically a post-doc course in everything wrong with pentagon procurement.  But I guess it's not all the pentagon's fault because congress'll give a wino a sucky just for a chance to cut off their nose to spite their face. (can't think of a better phrase, short sighted spending cuts that will cost them 10 times as much in the long run)", "id": "d2yu1oc"}, {"comment": "This is a prime example of the type of strawmen, half-truths, and nonsense hypotheticals that people will write when discussing the F-35.\n\n> 8.5+ years behind schedule and hundreds of billions overbudget.\n\nAs I've already said, the JSF program was originally [targeting IOC in the 2010-2012 timeframe](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/services-look-at-speeding-up-jsf-136987/). That's even before they declared a winner (note the date of the article). Now it's set to IOC in 2015-2018, which makes it 5-6 years late, which makes it par for the course for modern military fighter programs, and I gave examples of them.\n\n> It's strange. There's nothing F-35 people like more than comparing the F-35 to F-16s.\n\nThat's an odd statement, seeing as how I didn't compare the F-35 program to the F-16 program. They're from different eras.\n\n> What's even more strange is how little they like to discuss the 1990s F-22 having a more powerful radar. How the F-35 can carry what? 4 air to air missiles in a clean, stealthy configuration vs what? 8 for the F-22?\n\nSo you're basically comparing the F-35 with a plane that's twice the cost and designed specifically for that mission (air superiority). The F-22's radar has more T/R modules, but the F-35's radar has more advanced processing (its radar is a derivative of the F-22's). The F-35's radar has even demonstrated that it can jam the F-22's radar, even though the F-22's radar (like the F-35's) is AESA and thus very difficult to jam (or to even detect that it's being used).\n\nThe F-22 is designed for air superiority, and its weapons bays are optimized specifically around this particular load of 8 missiles (2 short-range Sidewinders, 6 medium-range AMRAAM's). You can see how tightly those missiles are packed in [here](http://www.hasegawausa.com/product-images/hsgs7245-weapons-lg.jpg) (albeit as a model). Consequently, it's less efficient when you try to put in other things; for example, each main bay can only accommodate 1 AMRAAM and 1 1000 lb JDAM. By contrast, for the F-35, designed to be a multirole/strike fighter (basically, bomb truck), each bay accommodates 1 AMRAAM and 1 **2000** lb JDAM. It *currently* can carry 4 missiles internally (replace the JDAM with a missile), but a later block (early 2020's) will upgrade it to 6 AMRAAM's internally (replace the JDAM with a trapeze that can launch 2 missiles), compared with the 6 AMRAAM's and 2 Sidewinders of an F-22. Not bad for a plane that's half the price. So in criticizing the F-35, a *multirole* plane, what you're *really* saying is that it will be able to carry 2 Sidewinders less than a plane that's twice as expensive and designed specifically for missiles.\n\nAnd then you can start carrying weapons externally; the F-35 will be able to carry a Sidewinder on each of its outboard hardpoints, plus 2 AMRAAM's on each of its 4 primary external hardpoints, so it will be able to carry a total of 16 missiles (14 AMRAAM's and 2 Sidewinders). Compare this with the F-22 which, when using external hardpoints (it has 4 of them, each can carry 2 AMRAAM's), can carry a total of...16 missiles (14 AMRAAM's and 2 Sidewinders).\n\n> And the F-35 people absolutely will never under any circumstances entertain a comparison of, for instance, what if any time in the past ~20 years, for instance, if, in 2011, there had been a honest, modern design to compare the F-35 against.\n\nHuh? I compared the F-35 to a bunch of programs that started between 1987 (Rafale) to 2002 (PAK FA), with the F-35 itself starting in 2001 (\"starting\" in this context is when a manufacturer wins the production contract, as Lockheed did in 2001 with the F-35). I don't know why you would try to argue that fighter plane development programs starting in the same timeframe shouldn't be compared with each other. I guess you can try to compare the F-35 with something like the J-20, but you'll have to wait another 5-10 years to see how the J-20's development pans out. How about the PAK FA, where Sukhoi won the contract in 2002, one year after Lockheed won the F-35 contract? *Except I did compare it as well,* and it's not faring any better. So I don't know what you're trying to say here.\n\n> But then they don't stop there. They go even further. \"What if you took the first production F-16 that came off the line in 1970, and maintained it continuously until 2065?\"\n\nWho makes that comparison? We talk about maintenance in terms of *fleets*. Who is saying that the first production F-16 from 1970 is supposed to be maintained continuously until 2065 as a comparison to the F-35? Nobody is saying the first F-35 is supposed to be maintained until 2070 either (although the *last* one will be). Another strawman.\n\n> Another one they like is, \"What if you compare a run of ~20 new build F-18s to ~2,700 F-35s and you ignore the fact that this comparison only shows A: that the F-18 has two engines, and B: economy of scale, and it shows absolutely nothing about the F-35.\n\nExcept the F-35 isn't being procured 2700 at a time. It's being procured in batches every year or so, just like any other fighter. It's that the *projected* total run going out to 2038 is ~2500 for the US and up to ~3000 total worldwide, but that's not how it's procured. In fact Bogdan is trying to get Congress to authorize a multi-year F-35 block buy specifically to lower the costs, because they're currently not allowed to do that.\n\nYou're so busy accusing others of making strawmen that you end up making a bunch of strawmen yourself.\n\n> Personally I like the lift fan a lot. But I strongly think that the marines should have their own lift fan jet without any of the baggage of the JSF program.\n\nThis just shows your ignorance of the F-35 program. It actually originated as CALF (Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter) with the observation that if you were to take a STOVL plane and remove the vertical lift part (i.e. lift fan), you end up with something that could replace the F-16. It then merged with JAST to create the JSF program. Much of the developmental difficulties of the F-35 has been with the Marine version. It's more accurate to say that if the JSF didn't have the baggage of the lift fan, the development costs would have been a lot less, but the Marines wouldn't have had a (clear) replacement for the Harrier, as it would be too expensive to develop on its own.\n\n> The whole idea behind the F-35 program was to have very low development costs by sharing a lot of the technologies of the F-22. Sharing a derived engine, sharing the same software, in fact, using the same radar and RAM, along with the same software.\n\nDepends on what you mean by \"sharing\" -- it's more that they developed those technologies further, not just applied them \"off the shelf\" to the F-35. They didn't just take the F-22's radar and slap it into the F-35. Instead, the F-35's radar is the F-22's radar *with an additional decade of further development*. Similarly, the F-35's stealth coating is more effective and more damage-resistant than the F-22's; in fact, it's not a \"coating\" per se, it's baked right into the skin.\n\n> If you can't, and instead, try to compare a run of 2,700 F-35s to a run of ~37 or whatever TWO ENGINE F-18s... You can fuck right off. Nobody's going to listen to anything else you'll ever say about the F-35.\n\nHuh? Again, there's not a single run of 2700 F-35's. It's being produced and sold in batches just like any other fighter. Additionally, there have been multiple comparisons done about the current costs of different planes, such as [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/3ppu7v/more_cash_needed_to_get_f35_to_australia/cw8mhmu) for flyaway costs (I know Lordderplythethird has one for actual purchase contract costs, i.e. including equipment and initial spares, but can't find it right now). Basically, it's on par with current multirole planes like the Rafale and the Typhoon.\n\n> You're sort of right about the media. It's very easy for the media to take a report that says \"X went wrong with Y program\" and turn that into a few column inches.\n\nSo here you bring up a bunch of popular clickbait issues that they've found with the F-35 *during development*. For example, the weapons bay thing is apparently because some of the avionics components inside the bays were not certified for certain conditions (IIRC, something like if it were flying at high speeds at low altitude for extended periods of time, and thus the heat doesn't dissipate quickly enough and the avionics may not work properly -- at higher altitude the surrounding air is cooler so heat is dissipated more quickly, and at lower speed there isn't as much heat generated). It's not that the avionics *couldn't* work or that the F-35 would crash, it's just that they weren't certified for it. So in the meantime, until they certify those avionics (or use different ones) in the development process, they open up the weapons bay periodically to clear out the heat. You can bet that if they decide to send the F-35 into combat, those avionics would get certified quickly (or they'll use different ones), and more importantly, *they wouldn't task the F-35 to fly at low altitudes at high speeds for extended periods of time* which they wouldn't really want to anyway; it's more efficient for jets to fly high, plus it increases how far away they can see things and imparts more energy to any weapons they fire. It's rather silly to complain about this if you look at the issue in detail.\n\n> That doesn't sound like a fair comparison at all. A super hornet's combat radius with, I assume, no external tanks is 390nm.\n\nYou shouldn't assume, especially when you're just looking up the stats from Wikipedia. Wikipedia's source, from [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140422131923/http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/fighter/f18.html), explicitly says that's with 2 480-gallon external tanks.

Then what standard do you propose to measure how long each plane takes to develop and enter service? IOC is a relatively common standard for when a military considers a plane to be operationally useful. The exact requirements are different simply because each plane is different and their specific roles (and the different militaries' needs) are different. For example, the Rafale IOC'ed only being able to conduct air-to-air missions (i.e. only able to fire missiles, no bombs) due to using the F1 version of its software, despite Dassault marketing it as an \"omnirole\" fighter to distinguish it from all the other \"regular\" multirole fighters. The Typhoon IOC'ed with [\"no refuelling probe, no gun, software for initial air combat training, no DASS, IFF, Thales PIRATE, MIDS and some other equipment.

A delay of roughly 13 years?\n\nIt's easy enough to just wikipedia the F-35 if nothing else to see that Full Rate Production (FRP) is currently planned for 2019. If you wanted to be more thorough you can look at the [official GAO report](http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/676584.pdf) (page 10) where it says FRP was originally scheduled for 2012 (in the 2001 baseline) but is now scheduled for 2019, and it's been consistently at 2019 since 2012. Once again, you're just making up random facts without spending five minutes actually looking into them.\n\n> You don't remember saying that the F-35 would be cheaper than the F-16 in this very thread in the post I was responding to? A sentiment that, though wrong, is shared by many people.\n\nHuh? I said when they originally estimated the cost of the JSF back in 2001, the estimated cost (~$30-50 million) was less than the cost of current 4th generation planes like the F-16 (in the $70 million range). Basically they way underestimated the cost of a 5th-generation F-35, to the point of it being less than 4th generation planes, when it's ending up about as much as 4.5 generation planes -- that's how far off they were, and yet that's the metric by which people use to discuss the cost overrun of the F-35 program. (Imagine if they had estimated the cost of making legacy 4th generation planes at that time, and how much those estimates would be off compared with now.)\n\nBy contrast, the part that I was talking about -- the part that you were responding to -- was about the time from winning the contract to IOC for different modern plane programs. I didn't put the F-16 in there, because it was from the 1970s, a different era of plane development.\n\n> The F-35 jamming the F-22 doesn't exactly sound like it was real world testing, and US flares apparently were very good at distracting american ir missiles... Almost worthless at distracting non american IR missiles though.\n\nActually, IIRC, it's not real world testing because it was done using the [testbed for the F-35's radar](http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123044035), namely this plane. The plane is obviously not stealthy, yet it was able to demonstrate jamming the F-22's radar. The same radar on a much stealthier platform, the F-35, would be able to jam much more effectively.\n\nI don't know what IR missiles have to do with jamming radars. Are you throwing random red herrings around again?\n\n> I'm comparing the F-35 to the only solid benchmark we have, a 1990s stealth fighter.\n\nReally? Do you not know about the other multirole planes out there, like the Rafale, Typhoon, Super Hornet, etc.? Stealth is not a *role*. The F-35's *role* is a multirole/strike fighter, just like those other planes. It's not optimized specifically for air superiority like the F-22, although it can do it. Yet at half the cost of the F-22, on internal-only it will carry only 6 AMRAAMs to the F-22's 6 AMRAAMs and 2 Sidewinders, and full weapons it can carry the same number of missiles...as a *dedicated air superiority fighter*. And you're complaining?\n\n> Has anyone told the US military that we've been trending away from bomb trucks since, basically, desert storm? That payloads are getting smaller, not bigger?\n\nYou should tell the world's militaries that, when most nations have been putting their money into multirole planes that have quite a bit of focus on air-to-ground, with only a few (US, Russia, China) trying for dedicated air superiority.\n\n> You compared the schedule of the F-35 against the schedule of the PAK-FA and found out that the US is roughly as bad as the near impoverished Russia. And '87 was more than 20 years ago.\n\nHaving about 20x the number of planes produced, and having one of the variants already enter IOC with another one later this year, is \"roughly as bad\" according to you? And '01 (start of F-35) was itself 15 years ago.\n\n> I told you what I think the F-35 should be compared against. A single engine F-22 derivative and clean sheet design.\n\nSure. Why don't you try to make that comparison? Do you have a real-world plane in mind?\n\n> Again... people who quote some crazy number for the cost of maintaining the... iirc the term they like to use is \"legacy fleet\".\n\nAgain, you're just showing your ignorance of how the military works. When we talk about how the F-35 fleet is scheduled to retire in 2070, for example, nobody is saying that the first F-35 will still be flying by 2070. Rather, it's the last ones produced -- production is schedule to keep going until 2038 -- that will be lasting until 2070. Similarly, when people talk about the \"legacy fleet\", they're not talking about taking a 1970s F-16 and trying to fly it until 2065 and figuring out the maintenance costs of doing that. *You're* the one making this ridiculous assertion without any sort of evidence that this is the comparison being made.\n\n> That said, you can't tell me that decoupling the F-35B from the JSF from the beginning wouldn't have simplified and shortened development of the F-35B, not to mention, have created a jet better suited to the requirements set forth by the marines.\n\nIt probably wouldn't have gotten off the ground, because it wouldn't have gotten funded. The Marines version has reportedly been the most troublesome variant of the F-35 program, and it's benefited from the large developmental resources poured into the program. And you're arguing that it would have been better as a stand-alone program?\n\n> And guess why I no longer trust you or Lordderplythethird?\n\nBecause we can document our arguments with original source material and show that you're just making up wild facts and numbers in discussing the F-35? I mean, really. You should spend five minutes looking into the factoids you write before writing them, or better yet, actually try to cite your sources for them. Preferably not from hitjob websites like War Is Boring.\n\n> A high lo high flight isn't in it's repertoire?\n\nIt's an issue they found during development, and it's one they'll fix during development as well.\n\n> it looks like the gripen NG has a combat radius of 702 nm, and it can supercruise, although it is single engine. But iirc it's engine is a lot more reliable than the F-35's.\n\nIt's interesting that you bring up the Gripen NG is supposed to be able to supercruise. Last I checked, it's because they can make its demo version go Mach 1.2 without afterburners. The F-35 can go Mach 1.2 for 150 miles without using its afterburners, just that Lockheed doesn't consider this \"supercruise\" because it's only marginally above the speed of sound. Somehow its engine is supposed to be more reliable than the F-35's? Is this something you have evidence for? We'll see...when the Gripen NG is actually flying. As a side note, there's also a lot of speculation regarding the Gripen NG's cost. It will *not* have the cost of a regular Gripen.", "id": "d36xo68"}, {"comment": "Ideally, the F-35's superior stealth rating allows it to destroy an F-16 before the F-16 is aware it even exists in a BVR (beyond visual range) engagement.

What's the worst thing that could happen, our terrible decision could ground as many as 2,443 and 94% of the entire combat airforce of the entire US military?  Let's just bet that the engine will never ground the whole fleet.  Oh, we chose that and of course the engine did ground the whole fleet?  Why do we keep taking such ridiculous risks on the most important, most expensive program we have for such ridiculously small rewards?  Are we just unrepentant gambling addicts on the biggest losing streak ever?\n\nThe F-35 is designed to carry a bomb load eleven times bigger than that of a world war 2 medium bomber.  Almost ten times as much as a B-17 super fortress heavy bomber.  Even though the kind of carpet bombing that that would be useful for is decades out of style.  Even though we're moving towards smaller and smaller bombs as we move very distinctly away from heavier and heavier bombs.\n\nThe F-35 is also designed for battle of britain type air to air combat outside the range of ground defenses.  Another enormous anachronism.  Like pretty much every other jet since the 1990s, the F-35 is designed for front aspect stealth against the small sort of radars you'd find in fighters or, particularly, missiles.  So it's fairly well prepared if it's facing the bad guy and the bad guy launches a missile at it, which isn't the worst idea anyone's ever had, and it's the same strategy pretty much every other modern jet made after the 1970s uses.\n\nIt's designed to not really do supercruise, which is supersonic without afterburners.\n\nThe main principle behind the F-35, is that right now we don't really need anything other than F-16s and superhornets.

Also, even if each service designed its own platform, the fact that each service would want something with advanced materials, sensors, engines, UX, &c. would have lead to massive costs anyway, and some redundancy. \n\nKeep in mind that there are other benefits to having a single (or few) platforms.

What they have going against them is they are not stealthy. Modern radar and air defense tatics it is believed can easily defeat both F-15 & F-16s. If you recall our last war with a foe with a modern air defense system was the first gulf war, possibly Bosina. The argument is that if the F-15, F-16 & the navy's F-18 would not last long if they were fighting a modern enemy, such as China. Hence the call of new jets.\n\nFor air-to-air combat the F-22 is the replacement of the air superiority of the F-15. The F-22 was very expensive and really only meant for air-to-air combat so only 187 were built. Now multi-role fighters such as the F-16 and F-18 which perform a wide range of jobs.(the F-15 is a multi-role fighter, e.g. strike eagle model and can and does perform a wide range of missons, but its primary role is air superiority which is what the F-22 represents). Besides the F-16, -18 there is also the Harrier which the marines use for their CAS mission. The F-35 was built to cover the roles these aircraft play in the USAF (F-35A), USN (F-35C) and USMC (F-35B). It is inot optimal but I am hopeful. \n\nActually the story of the F-15 and F-16 is nearly identical to the story of the F-22 and F-35. The F-15 was great but expensive and the F-16 was its low cost replacement.

We, as a society, need to be more critical of the function that women are currently expected to play.  Up until recently there was a heavy division of labor with women as the sole laborer in the domestic sphere.  However, while division of labor could have some theoretical upsides, in practice domestic labor is considered the 'obligation' of a woman, and hence is completely unpaid.  So in the 'nuclear family model', even though a housewife birthing children and maintaining a home and family was 100% necessary for husbands to perform paid work outside of the home and also to continue the human race as a whole, the compensation he received for his work was still viewed as ultimately his, and he had full control of it as well as all property purchased with it.  One can clearly see how this structure gives rise to a lot of the inequalities that we're trying to fix today.  While women are now allowed to hold paying jobs now, we haven't really replaced the division of labor, nor have we started viewing domestic labor as valuable.  Women are often still expected to nurture a family and maintain the living space, effectively for free.

Boys receive more encouragement growing up to be competitive, particularly in sports, while girls frequently are encouraged to be more cooperative, he said.\"\n\n* From the lead author of the WashU study (I found another [article](https://source.wustl.edu/2014/08/want-to-kill-creativity-of-women-in-teams-fire-up-the-competition/) which went a little more indepth than the HuffPo article):\n\n\"Baer emphasizes that nothing in his study suggests women are inherently bad at competition. Rather, it shows that gender stereotypes continue to influence behavior in the workplace.\n\n* This is from the Stanford study on Math tournaments:\n\n\"How does competition influence the gender composition of the top performers?  Due to the number of subjects, the top two quintiles are examined- the best 40 percent of performers.  In both of the noncompetitive treatments and in the single sex tournament, women account for 40 percent of those in the top two quintiles. Thus if the tournaments were run in single-sex groups, one may falsely conclude that men and women have similar responses to competition.  However, running mixed-sex tournaments significantly decreases the fraction of women in the top two performance quintiles from 40 to 24 percent.  Thus in mixed-sex competitions we see a decrease in the relative performance of women.\"\n\nIn terms of 'study quality' I think the Stanford one did the best, in that it overall had some experimental structure instead of just trying to measure an effect size.  The conclusions I take away from these is that women are not intrinsically less interested in competition (certainly in the single-sex math tournaments they did fine), but that there may be some incentive for them to *not be strongly competitive against men and not to be seen as strongly competative by men*.

Men and women are biologically different, therefore it is highly likely they are also mentally different, even if only subtly so.

I'm more concerned about industries or professions where unconscious bias, or systemic inequality reinforces itself, intentionally or unintentionally, and keeps people from breaking into the middle class.\n\nAs for your specific question about hiring, I think that's a bit of a false equivalency, especially in the context of the (anecdotal) evidence laid out in the original post. Affirmative action comes from seeking out other qualified candidates outside of the typical avenues. Businesses will and should choose the best candidate. If most of the candidates they find happen to be white or male, they should seek ways to find other candidates that more accurately reflect the population, because that is how they will get the best candidates. However, as we know, there do exist *enormous* disparities in quality of education, and wealth amongst racial groups in America, and that leads to a labor pool that is not representative of the full population, because those who had less opportunity, are less likely to become qualified. I guess my argument would be twofold. One, HR departments and hiring managers aren't making choices specifically on race, if they consider it at all it would be in the context of choosing between multiple qualified candidates. And two, that we need to do a better job at every step along the process to lift up people who have less opportunity. Success begets success.

The many groups were spread across a variety of environments, suggesting the adaptation isn't highly specific to a certain set of environmental factors.\n\nSo we can, with certain important caveats, assert that evolution in Earth-like conditions does tend to produce species that display some of these hallmarks of intelligence; we can also assert that our human intelligence is likely not an evolutionary fluke, but rather a trait that is strongly selected for once it begins developing. (The prevailing theory is that it was involved in a feedback cycle: some groups of humans were able to procure meat, which resulted in an energy surplus, which allowed more energy to be expended on encephalization, which allowed those groups to procure meat even more efficiently, and so on. The development of fire and cooking accelerated this process, as cooking allows our bodies to absorb the energy in food much more efficiently.)\n\n", "id": "d46epg3"}, {"comment": "I cant find the hubris in myself to think we are the only animals in this disgustingly large universe, nor can we be especially unique.

Let's say we want to use [Bayesian reasoning](http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-bayes-rule-can-make-you-a-better-thinker-471233405), which a lot of scientists consider to be a good guide to judging theories empirically. In this case we should start by assigning some \"prior probabilities\" to a few different hypotheses, which I think should at least include these: 1) \"no alien civilizations have existed in our galaxy\", 2) \"other civilizations have existed but have universally been uninterested in sending out Von Neumann probes\", 3) \"other civilizations have existed and sent out Von Neumann probes which were successful in continually spreading\", and 4) \"other civilizations have existed and wanted to send out Von Neumann probes, but the technology either proved impossible or something halted their spread\". The prior probabilities should be the subjective probabilities you would assign to each of these *before* you had checked our solar system for evidence of Von Neumann probes, and before you'd checked nearby systems for evidence of megastructures like [Dyson swarms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere#Dyson_swarm). Then the observation of a lack of any evidence of von Neumann probes having visited our system or constructed visible megastructures in other systems should, by the method of updating probabilities in Bayesian reasoning (going from the 'prior probability' to the 'posterior probability' based on how likely a given observation would be under each hypothesis, detailed guide [here](https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq)), cause us to significantly decrease the probability we assign to possibility 3), and increase the probability we assign to all the others, including 1) which says we are alone in the galaxy.\n\nNow, a priori, given what we know about the likely technical feasibility of self-replicating machines and plausible near-future methods of accelerating probes to at least say 0.1% the speed of light, along with the arguments in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6131v1), I'd say we should assign a much lower prior probability to 4) than to 1). Likewise, given the huge range of possible orders of magnitude for the probability of a civilization developing in a randomly-chosen star system, it seems unlikely the probability would be fine-tuned to the narrow range of values needed for us not to be the only one that arose in this galaxy, but for the number to be less than say 100--it's much more likely that either we're alone, or that many thousands or millions/billions of other civilizations have arisen in the galaxy, and in the latter case it seems unlikely that *all* of them would be independently averse to building self-replicating probes, which I think should lead us to assign a low prior probability to 2) compared to 1). Of course others may disagree with these statements about the prior probabilities of each hypothesis--that's the catch with Bayesian reasoning, a lot depends on opinions about reasonable prior distributions that may be fairly subjective.

Von Neumann probes are completely irrelevant to the simplest and most likely answer to the Fermi Paradox.

The conscious self plays an important role in allocating attention to the environment and making decisions.\n\n**The intuitive concept of free will is a simplified model of the complex relationship between the conscious self and bodily actions.** The self uses this model to understand how it affects the body. It's as if an engine made up an idealized model of combustion so that it could power the car more efficiently!\n\nWe see something similar with the concept of color. Color is a simplified way for us to understand wavelength, and hence the microscopic texture of our environment. Color maps onto wavelength fairly well, except that we see color as a circle when it's really just a line. We invented magenta to connect the two ends of the visible light spectrum, violet and red.\n\nSo, perhaps we can view free will as analogous to magenta. It doesn't actually exist in the world, and in fact it's a misrepresentation of how the world is (wavelength is a linear spectrum, not a circle). But for some reason, it's useful to us, so our brains made it up. Similarly, although the effect of our thoughts on our actions is entirely contained within the great causal web, it's easier for us to _think_ of our conscious selves as separate from the environment, with a uniquely privileged causal force on our actions.

Meaning, you have no actions, you only have reactions that can be traced back to the day you were born, and then traced back to the day every person that influenced you, was born, and so on. Even the rocks that you tripped on can be traced back to their original positions. All of this reality you live in can be traced back to the only action that happened in the universe. Some call it the Big Bang and it still is to be determined that it was an action and not actually a reaction to something else that was there before.\n\n\nYou can exercise your muscles and be strong, you can learn to speak a new language and you can learn to program in Haskell. You can change yourself every single day and you do! Learning changes you. But you cannot control the why. You cannot say \"Today I did something that was totally on me and not influenced by anyone or anything else.\". You can have original thoughts though. There's new things being done for the first time in the universe that were never done before. New thoughts, new ideas happening everyday. But all of them were a reaction to something else, in a massive chain reaction to an original point somewhere a long long time ago.\n\n\nI argue that there is no free will, because of this. Ergo, no control. And human life is actually still meaningful because there's suffering and there's the choice to limit suffering. A choice that you can make but, as anything else, is not really your choice but **your turn** to shape your life in a way that avoids and limits suffering to yourself and those around you.

Dot structures and hybrid orbitals are nice and all, but they're a simplified approximation of what really happens that are only ever incidentally correct -- and, as some molecules like SF6 and O2 show, sometimes they can be deliberately misleading.\n\nSo some basics to start: molecular orbital theory involves mixing sets of atomic orbitals to create molecular orbitals.  These molecular orbitals can be considered \"bonding\" (if the overlap of orbitals is constructive), \"antibonding\" (if the overlap is destructive), or \"nonbonding\" (if the overlap is negligible, because the orbitals are not in the correct relative orientation to interact).  In order to maximize the interaction between two atomic orbitals, they will ideally **1)** have compatible orientations and **2)** have comparable energies.  Accounting for energy levels can be difficult and handwavey without actually running experiments, but by measuring the compatibility of two orbitals can be done qualitatively with comparative ease by using a type of math called group theory, which allows for the classification of atomic orbitals into \"groups\" in terms of the types of symmetries that they have.  A fundamental rule of MO theory is that **two orbitals can only interact (constructively or destructively) if they have the same respective symmetries**.\n\nAlright, so that's the basics.  Let's get on to SF6.\n\n[Open this document.  Scroll down to the second page.](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/wsmcneil/220/MOSF6.pdf)  Confused?  Don't worry, it's not as bad as it looks.\n\nAlright, scroll back up.  What we're doing here is we're comparing the symmetries of all of the orbitals of all the atoms in SF6 to see which ones are compatible and capable of bonding.  SF6 is a lot of atoms and a lot of orbitals, so to simplify things we're using something called **Symmetry-Adapted Linar Combinations** of the fluorine atomic orbitals (SALC AOs).  Basically, it'd be a real hassle to think about the interactions of the central sulfur atom with each individual fluorine atom, so we're thinking of the whole set of all six fluorine atoms as a set.  Because the atoms form a neat octahedron around the central sulfur atom, the set of all six atoms is actually very easy to deal with.  You can see four of the twenty-four F SALC AOs on the first page, right under the heading \"four of the twenty-four F SALC AOs\".  Alright, so that's all the fluorines, that just leaves the sulfur atom, which only has its regular valence atomic orbitals: an s orbital (a sphere) and three p orbitals (the two-lobed peanut things).  Sulfur has more orbitals than this, of course, but most of them are considered \"core orbitals\" and are energetically and spatially too inaccessible to participate in bonding.  Sulfur's empty d orbitals are also inaccessible -- they're too far away in energy from its actual valence electrons to interact or \"hybridize\" with them in any meaningful way, which is why the \"sp^3 d^2\" hybridization doesn't actually happen.  The four orbitals you see on the left are the only ones that can meaningfully interact. \n\nAlright, so we have the central atom's orbitals and the set of orbitals for all the atoms around it.  Now all we have to do is determine their symmetries so we can figure out which of the orbitals can bond (remember, **two orbitals can only interact if they have the same symmetries**).  So how do we do that?  If you look at the upper-right hand corner of the first page, you'll see a weird table filled with numbers, with lots of letters on the side.  This is called a character table, and it allows us to break down each component orbital into the irreducible symmetry elements they have.  Don't worry about how it works (the answer is a lot of arithmetic), but if you're curious, the row headers (\"A1g, A2g, Eg...\") all represent different symmetry classes, and the column headers (\"E, 8C3, 6C2...\") all represent specific symmetry elements, and the numbers tell you whether or not a specific symmetry class has a specific type symmetry.  The \"Oh\" in the upper-left hand corner of the table represents the overall octahedral symmetry of the molecule.  I could go more in depth on this process, but it's really just a lot of adding and multiplying, and it's not really necessary to understand the overall picture.\n\nOkay, finally, on to the good stuff.  Scroll down to the second page.  What you're looking at is a molecular orbital diagram for SF6.  Orbitals are represented as horizontal lines, and electrons are represented by arrows; two electrons can fit in any particular orbital.  Dashed lines are drawn between constituent AOs and the MOs that they interact to create, and the energy of orbitals increases as you move up the page.  On the left are the four atomic orbitals we mentioned earlier for sulfur.  On the right are the twenty-four SALC AOs for the six fluorine atoms.  We've assigned them all different symmetry classes from the table on the previous page, and the ones with the same symmetry can interact.  If the interactions are constructive, \"bonding\" MOs are formed that are lower in energy (the ones in green).  If the interactions are destructive, \"antibonding\" MOs that are higher in energy are created (the ones in red).  If there just aren't any nearby orbitals with compatible symmetries, the orbitals just hang around and don't do anything, represented by \"nonbonding\" MOs in blue that remain at the same energy level.  You'll notice that at the bottom of the diagram are the six fluorine 2s orbitals, which are considered \"nonbonding\" even though they technically have the correct symmetry to interact with some of the sulfur orbitals.  This is because their energy levels are too far away from the sulfur orbitals to interact.  As I mentioned earlier, accounting for the energy levels of orbitals can be difficult and handwavey; unfortunately for the curious layman, there's no real way to know that these orbitals can't interact besides experience (or, as we chemists like to call it, \"intuition\").  Anyway, moving upwards on the diagram, we see *four* filled \"bonding\" orbitals, then fourteen filled \"nonbonding\" orbitals, and then some antibonding orbitals that don't mean anything because there are no electrons in them.\n\nFine, so what does this mean?  You might recall that a bond consists of two electrons being shared.  Well, we've got four pairs of electrons in \"bonding\" orbitals that represent shared electrons, so that means that this molecule contains four bonds.    \nBut wait, you say, SF6 has six atoms connected to the central atom!    \nGood eye.  There are four bonds and six atoms.  That must mean that **each S-F bond is a 2/3 bond**.  6 bonds \u00d7 2/3 of a bond = 4 total bonds.  Ta da!  If you really, *really* want to use Lewis theory, you could draw a bunch of resonance structures with 4 fluorines single-bonded to an S^2+ center, with two F^- ions hanging around.  It's a pretty lame *post-hoc* rationalization that requires that you already know the correct MO structure, but it kinda works.\n\nAnyway, I hope this longwinded post helped you get a handle on some of the nitty-gritty going on behind the scenes in MO theory, and perhaps provided a good example for how Lewis theory -- though easy to use -- isn't always correct.  I also understand that I talked about this on a pretty high level (I'm trying to writing this at about the level of a 1st-year undergraduate chemistry student), so feel free to ask questions or clarifications if something wasn't exactly clear.  If you actually want me to go *more* in detail on some of the weird stuff, let me know and I'll do my best to elaborate.\n\nAnd *that's* molecular orbital theory.\n\n*...baby.*", "id": "cy8koth"}, {"comment": "This is hotter than negative temperatures.

It compares the radioactivity of living there for a full year to a single chest xray, instead of comparing it to say, an airplane flight (10x higher) or a CT (100-300x).  Its a scare piece that makes it sound like most of the area is a heavily restricted cancer-causing hellscape, when residents can return to [most of it](http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Fukushima_zone_fully_redesignated-0808134.html) and the places they can't are where active cleaning is taking place.  The restrictions are more to keep people out of the way than to keep them safe.\n\nNot only that, but the government's stance is ridiculously conservative.  There is evidence that below 200 mS, radioactivity does not cause an increase in disease (the threshold model).  Thats four times higher than the radioactivity in the red zones, and there has never been any evidence for an increase in risk under 100 mS.  The radioactivity in Fukushima is far below that present naturally in places people have lived full time for hundreds of years.  Additionally, it is supported by evidence and common sense that a long term dose is much less harmful than the same dose delivered all at once- which is what all of our radiation models are based on.\n\nAnd another thing, I really hate it when people bring up Chernobyl.  Obviously it was the largest nuclear disaster ever... Everyone knows about Chernobyl.  Thousands of dead, millions given cancer, giant radioactive fire.  Except actually 31 only people died, even with a reactor failing catastrophically, after being built with multiple flaws that meant the reactor should never have been started, and incompetent employees.  There were 29 emergency situations before the accident, 8 caused by incompetence.  It's the [Bhopal Disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster) of nuclear.  Bhopal killed thousands and injured half a million in under 12 hours.  Even the most pessimistic estimates about the impact of Chernobyl are less than the *initial impact* of Bhopal, and nobody knew about it before the movie.  Chernobyl is not scary.  Its normal to light as far as disasters go.

The U.S. spent a $1.5 trillion on Iraq, another trillion on Afghanistan.  It is a lot. It was spent on tiny countries with very limited military capabilities fighting mostly against small arms and improved weapons. The U.S. realistically couldn't hope to fight a non-nuclear war against any major power because the cost of actually employing these military forces is so damn expensive. The U.S. would collapse. A mobilization effort like WW2 [only took 4x as much](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22926.pdf).  \n\nWhile the source I linked points out the % of GDP has decreased, I find that point to be secondary.  The structure of the economy today is greatly different than that of the 1940s.  There is a limit to how liquid the economy can be. Going on a war footing would be a disaster. The 2009 recession was a loss of ~3.0% gdp and the effects of it are still being felt.  In the grand scheme of things, it was a blip.

Even if you only attained a 1:1 kill / loss ratio (ie, one of your fighters for one of theirs, one of your destroyers for one of theirs, etc - something that is extremely unlikely), you still come out well on top.\n\nFor example, the US intends to buy nearly 2500 F-35s. They also intend to operate ~180 F-22s, a few hundred F-15C/Es, several hundred Super Hornets, etc. By comparison, Russia has about 700 fighters, including older Su-27s and MiG-29s. China has about 1500 fighters, but roughly half of those are extremely old MiG-21 derivatives (J-7s).\n\nAnd remember, if it's a war between superpowers, there's no option to just pull out because the war is getting too expensive; you just dedicate your entire nation towards winning the war, at the loss of some industries and at the benefit of others.", "id": "d04d5qc"}, {"comment": "Interesting points, but I think there are a bunch of things to consider. First off, a major war between the US and China or Russia would almost certainly have dire consequences for not only the US economy, but also the entire global economy, regardless of how it went. You're right about that. The 'saving grace' of all of that is due to the US' economic strength it's actually better prepared than most other countries to survive that sort of event and recover from it (assuming it isn't physically devastated during the course of the war). \n\nSecond, I think its worth mentioning that the bulk of the costs of the iraq and afghanistan wars weren't due to anything resembling traditional warfare, but have had far more to do with the fact that the US has occupied both of those countries for over a decade, and pumped ridiculous amounts of money into trying to build unified democratic institutions in populaces that have very little interest in such things. The parts of the wars that actually involved things that our military was designed to be good at (basically fighting other soldiers and destroying things) went rather quickly and pretty cheaply compared to all the other costs of the war. \n\nI think a more useful example would be the first gulf war in the 90's. The leadership at the time was wise enough to only ask the military to accomplish tasks that it was well suited to do, and the whole mission was accomplished fairly quickly and cheaply.\n\nNow it's certainly true that costs (and losses) would be a good bit higher if the fight was against a more advanced enemy than Iraq ever was, but my basic point doesn't change. \n\nFighting the Iraqi military and blowing up a bunch of the country's infrastructure isn't why the Iraq war has cost so much. It's cost so much because the US decided to occupy, run, and attempt to rebuild the country for over a decade. \n\nAt the end of the day, you're right, a major war between major powers would in some sense be a pyrrhic victory in many ways. You could say that WWII functioned that way to a large degree for all of the European countries. The allies won the war, but England, France, and Russia were all devastated and it took decades for them to rebuild.

Any like I said, they'll never outright attack us or anyone we're obligated via treaty to protect (eg Japan). \n\nThe original point was \"we need a big ass military because of all these treaty commitments we have\". And my argument is that maybe we don't need as big of a military as we have in order to uphold those commitments. And because of nukes, we don't need a bigass military to deter someone from attacking us. And because of our economic strength, other countries already have a huge incentive not to attack us. \n\nObviously we need a military. But I think it's foolish to just presume that we need one as big as we have just because inertia is hard to stop.", "id": "d03tw7l"}, {"comment": "> we can largely be assured that China won't attack us either\n\nThe concern in the south east asia build up isn't that China will attack America.  It is that China will attack one of America's allies in the region.  Basically that it is going to 'pull a crimea' on a larger scale for the oil rights in the area.\n\nThey're whipping their population into a frenzy of hatred against the Japanese, and Japan isn't backing down.  There's a very real possibility of a conflict, likely through one of the smaller countries in the region as a proxy.  Consequently the American (+Japanese, but America limited their ability to conduct war after WW2)  presence in the pacific needs to be superior to the Chinese.  *Just in case*\n\nAnd has been point out elsewhere in the thread spending on the military in America has been on a continual down-ward trend since the 60's, the height of the cold war.  There's currently a spike as the equipment that was created then is becoming more expensive to maintain than to replace.  Most of this was explained in OP's post.", "id": "d03v853"}, {"comment": "The prevention of actual attack/invasion of US soil is only one of many missions of the military. The presence of our armed forces abroad often has a political dimension all of its own- it can demonstrate commitment to the international audience, allies and otherwise. Just our military being there, without ever expecting to fire a shot, indicates that the US is acting in good faith with respect to its international agreements. Our navy, in particular, has an important role in protecting our and other countries' merchant marine from piracy. \n\nIt's tricky to measure how effective deterrence is, because it's hard to tell how many potential actions our presence has deterred over the years. Since they, by definition, didn't happen, it's difficult to tell whether our commitment of military resources was the deciding factor in that lack of action. Is the relative lack of state-on-state conflict in the last 60 years evidence that our military expenditure is bloated and superfluous? Or is it actually positive evidence in favor of our military hegemony? Cause and effect are difficult to suss out, here. I certainly don't have the skills or the knowledge to give anything other than a lay opinion. \n\nAs for the oudatedness and myopia of such a view, well, again, it's hard to say. It's certainly true that economic ties deincentivizes conflict between states, it hasn't always been the case that economic self-interest has proved enough to stop escalation into war. There were those in the early 20th century who maintained that the economic co-dependency of European states would be enough to force people to the table before war broke out. Unfortunately rational self-interest does not always win the day when it comes to international relations. \n\nWhile it's true that we don't have reasonable fears of someone attacking us, i.e. our borders and territory, it's certainly not the case that we can expect the same with respect to our interests. There's hardly a country on earth where the US doesn't have some interest or other- that isn't supposed to be sinister, mostly we're interested in preserving the status quo as much as possible. Many conflicts, wherever they get kicked off, eventually become our problem. \n\nSo, it's in our interest to prevent as many of those problems as possible. To do that, we want to cultivate the image that we would act decisively and *quickly* when our interests and allies are threatened. I'm guessing that a lot of that has to do with the general preparedness and extent of the US military abroad. Now obviously I can't know this for sure, but I expect that certain states would be a bit more cavalier about waving around their big sticks if they knew the nearest US military assets were thousands of miles away. \n\nI think it's misguided to think of US military expenditure in the same context as other nations. Most other countries can get away with providing for a military that secures its national borders. The US, on the other hand, is expected to enforce a certain kind of Pax Americanum globally. How far that expectation reaches is probably a matter for debate. We definitely don't want to reach Team America: World Police levels of jingoism, but it's a hard balancing act, one that only we attempt to strike, at least on the scale that we do. Of course we get a lot of flak when we screw it up, and deservedly so. But I don't think the response is to drastically scale back our military presence abroad, I suspect our allies would see it as a dereliction of duty, and our enemies as an enticing opportunity.

Just over a third of US debt is in foreign holdings, the majority is held by US citizens/banks/companies or the US government itself. \n\nThe US dollar is the foundational currency of the global economy, and widely seen as one of the safest places to invest.

It's actually most common for countries to issue their own currency, allow the exchange rate to float, and \"borrow\" in their own currency. The only major exception is eurozone nations which adopted the euro, effectively a 'foreign' currency. So the US, UK, Japan, China, etc. issue their own currency and denominate their debt in that unit of account.\n\nAs you mentioned, in the modern world, countries 'owing' each other has more to do with exchange rates. If China is a large net exporter, then there will be building exchange rate pressure from importing countries buying Yuan before purchases, or Chinese exporters to sell other currencies back for Yuan after sales. But that will cause Yuan to trade at higher prices / fall in exchange purchasing power. If China wants to continue pursuing export-led growth, they have to wade in and buy up other currencies and just sit on them (creating Yuan and trading in exchange markets). Same with other countries pursuing net-export positions, like Germany before the euro: if they want to keep selling BMWs/Volkswagens competitively to other countries, they need to accumulate foreign reserves.", "id": "d04fd96"}, {"comment": "OP of this post, didn't even realized I got linked here! I feel so honored\n\n> Yes, balance.\n\nThe issue with using nominal spending figures in terms of expenditures is that different nations have different costs of living and thus nominal spending doesn't account for actual military prowess.\n\nChina, at $129 billion, seems puny compared to the US. Consider this however - 25% of the US military budget goes to pay alone. The average Chinese officer makes [a tenth of what a US equivalent does](http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2015-01/19/content_6314553.htm). Does that mean that Chinese officer is only a tenth as capable? No, so that spending doesn't tell us who is more powerful.\n\nIn fact, consider that the spends $130 billion on pay alone a year, cutting that to Chinese levels would save the US nearly $120 billion overnight. But paying our troops a Chinese wage is neither feasible nor desirable.\n\nThe issue is compounded in all of the other areas of military pay. Maintenance, for example, uses parts and people from the US or US allies. R&D comes from US universities, research labs, and contractors.\n\nProcurement is the other big one. The arms market is **not** a free world market. The US won't manufacture a fighter jet in China, for obvious reasons. Unlike a smartphone which can be made by Chinese workers at Chinese wages, a jet like an F-15E Strike Eagle is going to be made in the US by US workers at US wages sourced from parts made in the US (both due to security reason and Congressional legislation).\n\nThis is true for other nations too. China and Russia are largely barred from buying European arms, and thus have large domestic manufacturers. Russian fighter jets, like the Su-34 - the Russian equivalent to the Strike Eagle - roll off the line at significantly cheaper prices (~$36-50 million per plane, the latest Strike Eagle sale to Korea came out at $100 million per).\n\nDoes that cost indicate the Strike Eagle is 2-3x better than the Su-34 in combat? No, not necessarily. So again, measuring military power using nominal spending doesn't tell us comparative military power.\n\nAdd on the fact that nations like the US, China, Russia, and India have economics of scale behind them, and the comparison with lesser military powers - like the UK - gets widened even further. The UK and EU nations in general have to collaborate on projects to drive costs down, hence joint projects like the Eurofighter Typhoon. Nations that go at it alone, like France, end up with the Dassault Rafale - a very capable plane, but more expensive than the newer F-35!\n\nTo sum it up, that disparity in spending isn't reflective of military power (even if we assume the Chinese aren't lying about their military spending, which many analysts believe is much higher than reported). What is the actual balance of power? Well, that's why the military and policy analysts have hundreds working on that problem all the time. It's complex.\n\nAll we can really say is that the gap between the US and China and Russia is smaller than most people think, and the gap between Russia/China and European nations is far greater than most realize.", "id": "d044zus"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d046645"}, {"comment": "> How do you view these commitments? Are they defensive or offensive? \n\nThey're defensive commitments \"with benefits\", if that makes sense. NATO nations aren't obligated to go to war for the US if the US goes to war by choice, as in Iraq where NATO nations like Germany and France not just stayed out of it, but opposed it. Turkey outright prohibited the US to launch the invasion from its territory, cutting off an entire border to enter Iraq from.\n\nSame thing goes for our treaties in South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and Japan - those nations are not in anyway obligated to assist us for offensive reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, these defensive commitments do help the US. South Korea, for instance, has sent South Korean forces to help the US in every conflict. It helped in Vietnam, the Gulf War, Afghanistan, and Iraq. \n\n>And would you say foreign countries have a choice on whether to have US military bases on their land?\n\nThey absolutely do. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of US bases overseas (i.e., bases outside of Afghanistan and Iraq when the US was 'at war' there) are held completely at the invitation of the host government.\n\nThe reason why the Iraq War officially 'ended' in 2011 was that the Iraqi government didn't want US troops there anymore, aside from advisors, and they wouldn't sign a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) to host US troops there. The SOFA is an agreement the US signs with every host country, outlining the rules/responsibilities of both sides regarding treatment of troops. The US didn't want US troops to be subject to Iraqi law (which yes, seems bad, but then again no one wants US troops to be subject to Islamic laws regarding things from alcohol to behavior either) so it got up and left.\n\nIn the early 90s, the Philippines amended their Constitution and banned the US from having bases on their territory. The US packed up their 90+ year old bases and left. Recently, they've asked the US to come back, due to China.\n\nThe bulk of US troops overseas are stationed in four countries: Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Italy. South Korea came about in the aftermath of the Korean War. Those other three nations happen to be the 3 Axis powers vanquished in WW2! In fact, as part of the treaties dealing with those nations after the war, the US (along with the other Allies) agreed to occupy those countries. The UK, for instance, still maintains a garrison in Germany after all these years, and it won't end as a permanent deployment until 2020.\n\nNow, those nations host US troops at their own invitation of course, as those treaties have been settled for a few decades now.\n\nIn addition, those lists about the US having bases overseas, are often misleading. Take for example, Soto Cano Air Force Base in Honduras. This often gets labeled a US air base - except that this base is a *Honduran* Air Force base that has an agreement to allow US aircraft to deploy out of it for drug interdiction missions and logistical support in South America. Its very misleading to call this an American base overseas - because by that criteria, we should label Naval Air Station Pensacola a German base by virtue of the German Air Force squadron stationed there.\n\nSpeaking of which - believe it or not, there are thousands of foreign troops stationed in the US as we speak. I'm not just talking about exchange tours - I'm talking about actual full units stationed here. Singapore - yes, tiny Singapore - has TWO Singapore Air Force squadrons stationed in the US. I mentioned the Germans - their training squadrons and a couple fighter squadrons are stationed in the US. The unclassified stuff on non-NATO/Japan/Korea/ANZUS troops in the US can be found on the State Department website:\n\nhttp://www.state.gov/documents/organization/197595.pdf\n\nThis kind of arrangement happens all the time for US troops abroad, and isn't just a US thing either. For instance, the US operates a base in Djibouti. You know who is about to be their new neighbor? China, who recently just signed a deal with the Djibouti government to open a base there, its first in Africa.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!", "id": "d04aex5"}, {"comment": "\"They absolutely do.

By that point the world was done with the taliban just like the world today is done with ISIS.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-National_Force_%E2%80%93_Iraq  \n\nAs for Somalia... \n\n\"U.S. drone strikes are now part of a larger U.S. military strategy to provide direct military support to African peacekeepers -- mainly Kenyans -- under attack from Al-Shabaab\" \n\n\"The missions are specifically targeting militants in the field who are directly attacking or threatening African Union Mission in Somalia peacekeepers. AMISOM is staffed by troops from nearly a dozen countries, but the bulk come from Kenya and Ethiopia on a regular basis.\" \n\nOh, and Al-Shabaab is a jihadist terror group, so it does technically fall under the war on terror.  So peace keepers are getting attacked and killed by Al-Shabaab so we send in drones to support the efforts to keep those people safe from jihadist terrorists. \n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2015/07/24/politics/al-shabaab-u-s-strikes/  \n\n\nThe idea that we just go into these places because we want to and we can is a myth.  Hell, even sending troops to Vietnam in the beginning took years of the administrations looking at the situation in Vietnam at the time.  Kennedy wanted to focus on places like cuba instead of asia, but when the south could no longer fight the north by themselves is when Kennedy decided to start sending troops in.  \n\nThe reason behind this was the fear of communism spreading and Russia gaining power when people on both sides of the iron curtain were worried about the treat of a nuke war.  We can look back at that now and laugh about how silly it all sounds but that the time people considered it a genuine threat.  Just like today people consider ISIS a threat.  \n\nAlso, lets not forget just how important peace through superior firepower really is in the world today. Best way I can describe it is this...\n\nWe have 3 people in high school... \n\n - The strong but supportive athlete  \n\n - The little guy who gets picked on all the time. \n\n - The bully who picks on the little guy.   \n\nThe bully will always pick on the little guy because he is too weak to stand up to the bully.  The bully will relentlessly torment the little guy because he has no repercussions to his actions. \n\nBut the bully will never pick on the athlete because he knows he will get his ass kicked.    \n\nSo the little guy decides to talk to the athlete and asks the athlete to protect him because there is nothing else he can do.  The athlete confronts the bully when the little guy is picked on and warns him not to do it again or he will pay.  2 things will happen after this.  Bully will get the hint and leave the little guy alone because he knows he will get his ass kicked or the bully will try to call his bluff and get his ass kicked.  \n\nRegardless the end result will always be the same... little guy ends up being left alone by the bully because the little guy allied with someone who has the physical upper hand.  \n\nAmerica's military is that supportive athlete.  Strong, ready to fight, and ready to protect the little guy from the bullies because we are strong enough that no one wants to mess with us.   \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention about the treaty that led to Vietnam \n\nthe Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), 1954\n\n\"In September of 1954, the United States, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan formed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, or SEATO.\n\nThe purpose of the organization was to prevent communism from gaining ground in the region. \"\n\nhttps://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/seato ", "id": "d03osw7"}, {"comment": "> Iraq ... was in relation to a devastating attack that killed over 3,000 innocent civilians and after constantly increasing terrorist attacks across the globe.\n\nLet's not just gloss over this!

", "id": "d03k62c"}, {"comment": "You keep mentioning that we have commitments via treaties, but do you understand the legal impact treaties have on our country? And you do understand that the North Atlantic Treaty (which NATO was founded upon) says that members agree to mutual defense of others *in response to an attack by any external party*, right? Which means if one NATO member attacks another NATO member, we don't have to do anything. It also means that if Germany decides to help France in response to terror attacks, we don't have to help Germany fight for France - it just means we have to help France (sorta...keep reading).\n\nAnd the treaties don't demand that we be the first and primary recourse for other NATO members. We could do a lot less and still comply with our treaty obligations. The NAT doesn't say \"Everyone's gotta help, but America has to help the most\" nor does it say \"If you help, you better make sure we win\". \n\nNot to mention Article 5 of the NAT (which requires members states to come to the mutual defense of other members states) has only been invoked *once* in the entire 60 year history of NATO. And that was in response to 9/11 - meaning America put diplomatic and economic pressure on our allies to act in accordance with it. If another country tried to force us to act on their behalf, we could simply revert to the more oft used Article 4, which simply requires that we consult with NATO members about a forthcoming military operation. And even if we refuse to help at all, what is the country gonna do? Put embargoes on all US goods? Stop exports to the US? With the exception of China and India, there's really no single country that could exert such great economic pressure on the US such that we'd be forced to intervene militarily lest we risk crumbling our economy.\n\nSo, in short, you're severely overstating the power NATO and other international treaties have over the decision for the US military to intervene or not. You act like we're going to be locked out of the global economy if we don't rush to give all of our military might to any cry for help any ally may ever send out to us. That's not that case, it's never been the case, and it probably never will be the case.  ", "id": "d03rgn8"}, {"comment": ">Which means if one NATO member attacks another NATO member, we don't have to do anything.  \n\ntrue, but iraq was a result of us being attacked by a non-nato member.

We could do a lot less and still comply with our treaty obligations. \n\nYou are very correct, but you are negating to remember that we are the only country with a military that can respond in a quick and efficient manner.  Which was explained in the OP.  \n\nWe dont respond then we are letting the bully torment the little guy, which in a global economy could be financially detrimental to both parties in the long run.  You know, since this is all about improving the budget at the end of the day. \n\nWhat do you think would happen to our military budget if we allowed ISIS to go uncontrolled in the EU just because our allies military is not strong enough?  \n\n>The NAT doesn't say \"Everyone's gotta help, but America has to help the most\" nor does it say \"If you help, you better make sure we win\". \n\nAgain with your reading comprehension.  Go back to the OP and reread it.  We have to help the most because we are the only military capable of providing that type of support.   I will refer back to the little guy vs the bully analogy.  This is where projected force (again, explained in the op) comes in handy, like having a carrier show up that the doorstep of a country that is starting to act like a bully. \n\n>And that was in response to 9/11 - meaning America put diplomatic and economic pressure on our allies to act in accordance with it.  \n\nNo pressure, we were attacked and the EU supported us.  Just like we supported the UK during WW2.  Again, reading the links provided would have helped with this understanding. \n\n>If another country tried to force us to act on their behalf, we could simply revert to the more oft used Article 4, which simply requires that we consult with NATO members about a forthcoming military operation.  \n\nIt is in our best interest to help a NATO ally, for many different reasons, if they are attacked.  So I dont think it would ever be forced.  Why would we want to resist helping an ally if it means preventing an even larger conflict from developing?  We learned that lesson from WW2.  \n\nWW2 resulted in 407,300 US military deaths. \n\nIraq had 4,425 US military deaths.  \n\nIf you help an ally early against an aggressor you can prevent an even larger war down the line.   \n\n>And even if we refuse to help at all, what is the country gonna do? Put embargoes on all US goods? Stop exports to the US? \n\nOr create an even more hostile and unpredictable environment in an allied country, in a global economy.  If the EU becomes unstable because of ISIS or any other threat for that matter the world economy would be affected.  Look at how the 2008 crash affected the global markets.  What do you think would happen to global economics if the EU becomes unstable from something we could have prevented by helping early?   Again, refer to my argument about early intervention preventing larger wars. \n\n>So, in short, you're severely overstating the power NATO and other international treaties have over the decision for the US military to intervene or not. \n\nAnd you are completely underestimating how important global economics and politics are.  We help them because we have the ability to and it keeps things in line compared to not getting involved at all.  \n\nLastly I want to reiterate one thing... \n\nThe period of time when the US was the most isolationist was between the 20's and 30's.   We didnt have the large military we do today but  imagine how WW2 would have played out if we would have helped stop Hitler in the 30s?  \n\nIronic that the only time we said we wouldn't get involved is the time when things really turned to shit. \n", "id": "d03tcpj"}, {"comment": ">true, but iraq was a result of us being attacked by a non-nato member.

Especially when some say they're partly super-targets in an era of smart missiles. Maybe a carrier being retired is an opportunity to cut back a bit.\n\nI've explained it elsewhere:\n\n>Now, ever wonder how the US came about to needing exactly 11 fleet aircraft carriers, or how they even came up with that number in the first place?\n\n>It turns out, there's a rhyme to the reason. Note that the US has one aircraft carrier in Japan - that one is permanently forward deployed there. That leaves 10 carriers out of the normal complement of 11.\n\n>Well, all US aircraft carriers are nuclear powered. They serve 50 years, with a single refueling of the reactors at the 25 year mark. This is a lengthy process, which puts the ship in drydock for over a year. \n\n>At this time, they also go through major repairs as well as upgrades/refits to make sure the ship is relevant for the last 25 years of service. In total, this takes the ship out of commission for about 3 years. In addition, the time spent afterwards is put to testing the new systems and training the crew on it as well.\n\n>With a lifespan of 50 years, the Navy staggers the production of its carriers by 4-5 years. Thus roughly when one retires, one enters service. And this also means that with 10 carriers at home in the US, one is almost always in drydock going mid-life refueling. Thus, we now have 9 ships.\n\n>Well, the Navy deploys its carriers in eighteen month cycles. Every 18 months, a carrier is supposed to spend 6 months of time on deployment. Then afterwards it spends six months at home giving crew vacation time, rest, and time to do minor repairs and maintenance. The next six months are spent training and doing 'work ups' to get ready for deployment.\n\n>As thus, to maintain a 24/7 presence of a carrier on deployment, the US rotates ships in groups of three. Furthermore, with the country spanning two coasts, the US has committed to having at least one available on the Atlantic side and one on the Pacific side at all times. Add on the Congressional mandate to have one available in the Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean, and you get three cycles of three carriers each.\n\n>Nine carriers + one in drydock + one forward deployed in Japan, and voila, the math works out exactly.\n\nIt should be noted that the current disparity won't last long. The UK has two new carriers coming out, China is building its second of four planned by 2025, India has 2 already with 2 more in the works (including a new one to be launched next year, and a future nuclear powered super carrier).

Put another crew on and get that ship back out to sea.\n\n> Add on the Congressional mandate to have one available in the Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean\n\nHow about getting rid of this mission ?\n\nSounds to me that we could cut down to maybe 6 or 8, with the changes I just listed.\n\n> The UK has two new carriers coming out, China is building its second of four planned by 2025, India has 2 already with 2 more in the works (including a new one to be launched next year, and a future nuclear powered super carrier).\n\nHow many of these are super-carriers, equivalent to our 12 ?

If the money is not currently available, acting upon the knowledge is merely pushed back to a further date.  Eventually making an investment > never making said investment in the first place.\n\nAs investments grow and succeed, a positive feedback loop reinforces successful behaviors.  One can look at the stereotypical Asian kids and see these loops molding out asian clones by uniquely individual families all pressuring for similar results.  Perfect SATs, plays violin/cello/piano, dozen extra curriculars like tennis & golf, straight As, ivy-league school.\n\nIn communities of extreme poverty, the feedback loops are generally negative and detrimental and also serve to mold a group of individuals following similar stereotypes of poor academic performance, drug abuse, poor work ethic, etc.\n\nMany immigrants from Asia came from generational wealth, sold everything and came to the US.  Despite not having anything, there was still the knowledge of generational wealth and it was acted upon.\n\n*Immigrant Unemployability*\n\nThe other large difference between immigrant populations and African American populations was that non-english speaking immigrants are/were inherently unemployable due to the language barrier.  This systemically forces immigrants to become entrepreneurs.  When asking an immigrant, \"how did you succeed at business?\" the reply is, \"It was this or starve, it's not like there is a fallback job. so we made it work by hook and by crook\"    7-11s,  dry cleaners, corner food shops, etc.  Stereotypically immigrant-run stores are that way because they really had no other options other than to be entrepreneurial.  So as business owners, immigrants won and had the cash to reinforce cultural investments like golf lessons and SAT tutoring for their children.  In contrast, individuals in communities comprised of poverty had a best bet of obtaining a job making minimum-wage, which would doom that individual to a life of poverty. Today, min-wage workers supplement with side-gigs, but successfully scaling a side-gig to a profitable full-time gig is extremely difficult to achieve when there is a minimum-wage job fall-back.\n\nImmigrant communities today make upward mobility a bit more difficult for new immigrants as there are now immigrant meccas like china-town, korea-town, where an immigrant can function without knowing any english.  Immigrants in 2016 aren't forced to become entrepreneurs anymore, they can also get employed for substandard wages of $9-10/hour, meaning they will probably stay in poverty rather than be able to have a great business year and grow their business to an upper-middle class income.  And this can be seen now.

You thus have a process that selects for richer and more motivated people, and it's not surprising that they do well when they immigrate. This holds true across all racial groups too. African immigrants do much better than American blacks, with Nigerian-Americans having the highest levels of college attainment, higher even than Asians. And furthermore, when the selection process does not select for the rich and motivated, as in refugees, those groups tend to do relatively poorly. Hmong and Vietnamese refugees are some of the Asian groups who nevertheless remain poorer than their Chinese, Japanese, and Indian counterparts.\n\n>**EDIT:** I'm a Nigerian currently studying in the US, and yes, the immigration process absolutely selects for a different class of person. Those who leave Nigeria are the ones who can afford immigration fees, visa interview fees, medical testing fees, and the price of a ticket.

Fortunately we are making strides, it is a lot easier for a black person to succeed now than fifty years ago, but they need to work hard and be lucky.\n\nTo the second question, the first would be acknowledging that racism still exists and is a problem. There are a lot of studies that show it exists, but a lot of people like to bury their head in the sand. Secondly we need to change the perception of black people in the media. Stereotypes still very much exist and are very harmful. Black people are stereotyped to be more violent and less smart in the media, and so we all unconsciously pick it up and internalize those stereotypes. And then we also just need to support our poor in America. It's been proven that people can't pull themselves up by their bootstraps and escape poverty on their own. They need help. So we need programs that help against substance abuse, that give people the opportunity to succeed. That doesn't mean being tough on crime and continuing mass incarceration. We should take the money we waste filling prisons and reinvest it in broken and distraught communities.\n\n>the opportunities are there and that black people don't take them.\n\nThe thing is, the opportunities are not there, and you're forgetting that discrimination still exists. It's harder for black people to succeed, not because its easy for white people, but because there are additional obstacles. I work with homeless youth, and it's very hard to convince them that they have a shot at going to college or being successful, or even going to a trade school and making a modest living. Their entire lives they have been kicked in the ass by society. Black kids and poor kids are more likely to be suspended for non-violent offences and are more likely to be harassed by the police. They have a harder time getting jobs, and they already struggle so much living in poverty. So it becomes very difficult to convince a kid who's faced so much adversity, that they have any hope of living a successful life. And then if they do work hard and study, they see their friend down the street who doesn't study, but sells drugs and makes bank. So do they struggle and fight for the .01% that they could make it and be successful, or do they take the easy way out and sling drugs and make (to them) quite a lot of money.\n\nAnd this doesn't even go into the fact that a lot of these programs do not have the resources to really reach everyone in the community. We constantly have to turn kids away because we don't have room for everybody. And we can't even do enough for the kids in the program because we don't have the money to help their parents pay rent, or get food on the table. ", "id": "d2jru39"}, {"comment": "Great post.

There are multiple reasons given, but the big ones are:\n-Central nervous system neurons tend not to heal when they are severed. Peripheral nervous system neurons don't, and we're not sure why. This is the reason why you can cut yourself pretty badly but still retain/regain full neural function, but if your spinal cord gets damaged it's very unlikely that you'll make a full recovery.\n\n-The second, and probably more important one, is that there are literally millions of neurons in the spinal cord that all have specific functions and which would have to be in some way reconnected. This is hard for a lot of reasons beyond just their number and their tendency not to heal. The OP describes how difficult it is just to isolate individual neurons (the process that they use in their research is destructive and difficult) and even if you were able to somehow identify the individual purposes of those neurons, you'd still be left with the very daunting task of reconnecting them which is awfully hard to in general, and even harder to do with millions of pieces of microscopic tissue on a person who could die at virtually any time during the procedure. To make matters worse, the placement of those neurons varies from person to person, and there may be cases where even if you could reconnect those neurons to their matching partner, they might still be incompatible with each other. \n\nI don't like using analogies when explaining complicated topics because I feel that they tend to make people over-confident in their understanding of things, but in this case I think one is appropriate. Imagine I gave you two bundles of \"just\" a million unmarked, hair-thin wires and told you that you'd have to test every one of them to figure out what it does, and then match the like wires up all within the span of, say, 24 hours. If you worked non-stop for 24 hours straight, that would leave you with only about .09 seconds per wire. Even if someone laid all of the wires out end-to-end and all you had to do was touch the ends together to get them to reattach (so no finding out what they do or anything) you'd still come nowhere near completing the task.\n\n**The second poster** isn't saying that the head transplant *would* work, just that the OP may be overstating the need to reconnect all of those individual neurons. Fairly recent research has pointed us toward an interpretation of neurophysiology that suggests that our nervous system isn't \"wired up\" in the 1:1 fashion that a computer chip might be. Instead we've found that the nervous system has a much higher \"plasticity\" than previously believed.\n\nReferring back to our wire analogy, the second poster is suggesting that you wouldn't necessarily have to reconnect all of the wires, nor would you have to reconnect all of them exactly correctly because the wires (neurons) themselves are able to adapt themselves to serve different or multiple purposes. They're suggesting that as long as we get enough of them connected, even if they aren't to the \"right\" ones, the adaptive nature of the human nervous system combined with physical therapy *might* be enough for the transplant to be considered some kind of success. \n\nWith regards to neuroplasticity, the second poster is not incorrect. There have been experiments with artificial sight devices (very low resolution light detectors) which interface with the body by way of a pad of electrodes that are placed on the tongue. Even though the tongue has absolutely nothing to do with sight, most of the patients (who were blind) were eventually able to tell the difference between light and dark rooms, as well as even detect motion to some extent. \n\nThe end of the second poster's reply is really the most important part. They don't expect this to be a success in the traditional sense. What they are saying is that there is some chance that the patient might survive, and if they do and are able even to gain some control of the body such as breathing without a respirator or even just moving a finger, that would be so ground-breaking that it would be considered a success. They discuss the possibility of the patient regaining something approaching full mobility, but they certainly don't appear to be putting any money on it.\n\nSo TL;DR, the second poster isn't saying the first one is definitely wrong, they're just pointing out that the procedure as it has been described isn't going to be as intricate or precise as the first poster is suggesting. The researchers know that it's not really possible to reattach all of those neurons, so they're going to mate up the circulatory systems, attach whatever specific, easily identifiable neurons they can, and then hope that enough other connections form naturally that the patient will at least survive and possibly regain *some* level of mobility.\n\nMy two cents: I think our research dollars would probably be better spent on finding ways to make better artificial or lab-grown organs and body parts. This research will probably provide us with some useful insights, but I doubt very highly that head transplants will ever be a practical solution to anything.

[I've compiled a long list of these](/r/dredmorbius/comments/1v052g/what_we_mean_by_these_things_questions_mostly_on/),  there's also a follow-up set I need to post here.\n\n**Smith was the first person to think and reason deeply on economics in a modern context.**  He was writing at the very dawn of the industrial revolution.  Check that:  _he was writing when James Watt was inventing his steam engine_.\n\n**No wait:  Watt was in _Glasgow_ at the same time Smith was.**\n\nOh, just fuck me:  **SMITH BROUGHT WATT TO GLASGOW UNIVERSITY AND SET UP WATT AT THE UNIVERSITY** after the Hammermen (the blacksmith's guild) ran Watt out of business.\n\nThe guy who set up the model for organising our current economy, and they guy who started the whole concept of mechanically-based industry shooting the shit over beer.  Like I so don't want to sit in on what they talked about (NB: I'm in the market for a good Smith biography).\n\nSmith talks about _what wealth is_, how _money_ came to be.  What determines _prices_.  How _labour_ should be compensated.  Relative power positions of _employers vs. employees_.  What five factors _differentiate earnings in various careers_.  Why _government should fund schools, roads, courts_, and more.  The _many many many ways business and financial interests skew laws to their own benefit._\n\nIt's _hugely_ appropriate for our current times.\n\nThe more so because _the contemporary presentation of Smith addresses virtually none of this_. \n\n\"Invisible hand\". \"Division of Labour\". \"Free Market\".\n\nHell, you get guys who _really seriously do their research_ who think Smith was all about _laissez faire_ (William Ophuls, as I've noted).  Nope.  Just got snowed by the three-decade propagana show (Ophuls was writing in the early/mid 1970s).\n\nThat said, reading Newton and Darwin is _also_ strongly encouraged, and for much the same reason as I recommend reading Smith:  **seeing _how_ ideas are formed and argued is highly instructive.**\n\nI'm one of those people who goes to art exhibits of grand masters hoping to see sketches, studies, and unfinished works, _because they reveal how the deed is done._\n\nSmith, and Newton, and Darwin, aren't Manifestations of God.  At least, no more than you or me.  They simply _set about to understand their world, as best they could_.  And made tremendous progress.  Also some stupid mistakes, on occasion.  But that's the risk you take.\n\nWhat _really_ grinds my gears though are contemporary economists who argue in one breath that studying Smith has no value ... then in the next utterly misrepresent him.  Mankiw does this IIRC in a YouTube vid.  Shit, man:  say \"this is my view, but check for yourself\".\n\nStudy them.  Not as gods, but as fallible but inspired men.\n\nThat's all I'm asking.\n\n----\n\n**Edits:** Corrected \"Glasgow University\" for \"University of Edinburgh\".

John Kerry and Barack Obama are both solidly Third Way/New Democrat politicians.

"]], [[{"comment": "Wow I totally believed that it was SA driving shale producers out of business too. got schooled.", "id": "cz7e39s"}, {"comment": "The experts I saw on Newshour say this *IS* what is happening, notice how all the stuff about \"Saudi Arabia not doing this because of Iran\" stuff he mentioned wasn't actually given sources, but only educated speculation.  The truth is that geopolitical and economic experts *do think that they are doing this to screw with iran and Russia*.\n\nWe can see this from /u/MrDannyOcean's own comments.  Saudi Arabia produces 13% of the worlds oil.  That is a lot, no matter what OP says, enough to significantly increase profits of all other oil producing nations by millions of dollars if they were to cut production alone.  \n\nOil is fungible, this means that oil from X, is no different than oil from Y.  So when X stops producing oil, the scarcity of oil increases, and Y Z, A, B, and C all make more money, and X loses out.  In this situation, no one wants to stop producing oil unless they are guaranteed to get a large number of others to also stop producing, so that they still increase their own profits while reducing production along with every one else.  This way if X Y Z and A reduce their oil production, so long as B and C don't increase theirs (which they have no incentive to do typically) they gain increase profits because of the increase scarcity.  By Saudi Arabia showing that they are not going to reduce production, they scare others from attempting to lower production.  Iran produces 5.1% of the worlds oil, and Russia produces 13% of the worlds Oil, what /u/MrDannyOcean doesn't understand is that you can't just consider Saudi Arabia's 13% oil production when considering the effect it has on oil prices, you have to consider its adversaries as well.  Russia and Iran support the Assad regime, which Saudi Arabia is backing rebels to undermine the regime, and is currently involved in Yemen combating Iranian backed rebels.  So dropping the price of oil would help Saudi Arabia, who is in direct contention with geopolitical interests of Russia and Iran, so neither of those countries are willing to drop their oil prices.  Together this stops 13+13+5.1% (31.1% guys, holy shit, that is a lot of oil) of the worlds oil production from coming down (which you could argue stops other nations in Opec from dropping their prices, considering both Iran and SA are in it, effectively stopping more than half of all oil production from reducing).  Oil is also a huge part of the Iranian governments budget, as seen here\n\n>Most of the country's exports are oil and gas, accounting for a majority of government revenue in 2010.[28] Oil export revenues enabled Iran to amass well over $100 billion in foreign exchange reserves as of 2010\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Iran\n\nSame story for Russia as well\n\n>Russia have signed a cooperation agreement in the energy sector with Lebanon.[28] As of 2012 the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 16% of the GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Russia\n\nWhat is auxiliary is the effect on shale oil profits in the US (who's geopolitical interests in the region, at least right now, are neutral for Saudi Arabia). The US both helped Iran, but threaten Iran with more sanctions if they mess up, but also attempt to counter Assad, and are at odds with Russian geopolitical interests.  The problem with shale is that it costs a lot to dig up, and while /u/MrDannyOcean sort of covered this issue, he didn't really seem to understand the scope of the cost of digging up shale.  It simply will never be as cheap as getting \"easy oil\", and the enormous costs is exemplified with this wiki quote:\n\n\n>The production cost of a barrel of shale oil ranges from as high as US$95 per barrel to as low US$25 per barrel, although there is no recent confirmation of the latter figure.[4] The industry is proceeding cautiously, due to the losses incurred during the last major investment into oil shale in the early 1980s, when a subsequent collapse in the oil price left the projects uneconomical.[5]\n\nShale can be profitable, but oil typically needs to be over 50$ a barrel for it to be worth it (which under normal circumstances is not a really a problem). \n\nI think its safe to ignore the conclusion that /u/MrDannyOcean came up with, that this is not a geopolitical conflict issue, and listen to geopolitical experts opinions on this instead, you can typically find PBS talking about this on Newshour, and I'm sure BBC and other decent news sources are good sources for this kind of recent information as well. \n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry_in_Iran\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_shale_economics\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production", "id": "cz7ity4"}, {"comment": "Hi, popping in here since I was mentioned.\n\nYour conclusions don't explain several things.  The crucial thing being this - why did Saudi Arabia let oil drop to fifteen dollars a barrel in the 90's before agreeing to cut production?  It wasn't to hurt Russia, as they didn't give a damn about collapsing, inept Russia at that time.  It wasn't to hurt Iran, because the Sunni/Shia conflict was not very hot at that time (and certainly not as white-hot as it currently is).\n\nIt's because they didn't trust other OPEC members.  Pure and simple.  They don't trust other OPEC members to actually cut production, and so unless the price of oil gets hilariously, incredibly low, they just will not cut production.  Ever.  \n\nThe same thing happened in 2008 during the great crash.  The quote\n\n>On 10 September 2008, one such production dispute occurred when the Saudis reportedly walked out of OPEC negotiating session where the organization voted to reduce production. Although Saudi Arabian OPEC delegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously that they would not observe them. The New York Times quoted one such anonymous OPEC delegate as saying \"Saudi Arabia will meet the market\u2019s demand. We will see what the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil. The policy has not changed.\"[58]\n\nis relevant here.  Again, Russia/Assad was not a critical adversary for the Saudis at that time.  Iran was already massively sanctioned in the oil industry at this point and so it couldn't affect them all that much.  Again, the Saudis just want to pump for economic reasons.\n\nIt was true in the 90's, it was true in 2008 and it's still true today.  As I said in my post, I'm sure it's a nice side effect for the Saudis that shale, Russia and Iran are feeling the pain of low oil prices.  But it just isn't true that it's the primary reason they've kept pumping.  \n\nEDIT:  Incidentally, the lack of trust in other OPEC members has gotten worse since the 90's. The Saudis know that Venezuela is now a massive basket-case and will probably cheat.  Iraq and Libya used to be stable and somewhat dependable, now they're not even functioning countries any more.  The African nations like Nigeria and Angola still have huge governance problems.  The Sunni/Shia war has turned white hot so Iran won't ever cut in sync with SA (whereas they might have previously).  The Saudis have even less trust than they did before in most of the members (gulf states excluded).", "id": "cz7rnwl"}, {"comment": "Hey, I think you and the parent comment have some interesting points, but I just want to point out one thing, in your Op you said\n\n>As an aside, the entire 'drive shale out of business' model wouldn't really make a lot of sense anyways. Shale is a flexible (well, flexible for O&G) type of production that can start/stop fairly quickly. If the price goes back up, shale production revs back up and the price drops again after just a short interlude.\n\nWhich is true, but I think this is also the reason why shale is a more existential threat to OPEC than you're giving it credit for. If the break even for SA is ~$20, and for NA shale it's ~$50, that means the price can never really again rise back up to levels from the last decade. If OPEC manages to band together and push it up, once it hits $50-60 per barrel US shale resurrects and drives it back down. The problem is the is that OPEC countries need the price of oil high for their economies to function (I've always been told $80 per barrel on /r/economics). Yes, SA can turn a profit at say, $30 per barrel, but they can't survive on that margin for long -at least not without restructuring their countries for which there isn't political will yet.\n\nSo since shale is a phoenix, what *can* SA do to mitigate the pain? It can go after weaker crude producers. This is why I think Iran and Russia more than just incidental secondary targets. If one or both, but especially Russia since it's not in the cartel, can be damaged for the long term, SA can gather itself slightly more breathing room.", "id": "cz7tog3"}, {"comment": "> Which is true, but I think this is also the reason why shale is a more existential threat to OPEC than you're giving it credit for.

The KSA leadership is starting to implement new revenue streams via taxation, and starting to cut benefits.  KSA in particular will survive easily with less generous welfare states and subsidies.  Other countries like Venezuela are deeply, deeply screwed - the primary thing that kept Chavez's system working as long as it did was high oil prices.  \n\nAnd the 'going after' narrative still doesn't make a lot of sense.  For instance - Iran's oil is nearly as sweet/light as the Saudi oil, so they are basically always going to have incentive to pump - Iran's long term strategy can't be altered by low prices right now.  Russia's can perhaps be altered a little bit, as their oil is more expensive.  They have less incentive to invest right now into long term projects (especially given the dreadful current state of their economy), so if the price goes back up to 50-60 in a few years they might be stuck with lower production (due to lack of investment now).

I and many of my grade school friends were Metallica fans since Kill 'Em All (which was not a big commercial success). The general consensus among my small circle of peers is that Metallica was all done after Cliff Burton died in '86--he was the sole great musician in the group. The last real Metallica album was 1988's And Justice for All, which still had a strong Burton influence. A few of my friends disagree, and like the Black Album and even what followed, but we have shunned them for this and they will forever be outcasts in our eyes."], [58, "He fucked up by not mentioning Cliff Burton at all.

And fans are upset because artists aren't making the same music just for them. "], [16, "I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about the opinions of the kinds of people who would judge you on your haircut. I find a lot of these \"hardcore\" metal fans to be very close-minded and stuck in the 80s (plus extremely hypocritical about the idea that metal is supposed to be purely about music, not image). Besides, continuing to be the band these people want them to be, rather than naturally evolving and being the band they want to be, would be my definition of \"selling out\". \n\nWhere I think this post is completely off the mark is the insistence that their music evolved purely to gain fans, and not at all because maybe they grew and their tastes evolved through the 90s. Whose music tastes *don't* change from their teenage years to their late twenties? This write-up seems to be from a very biased perspective of someone who is still a little bit sour that the 80s died, and I think it's completely wrong to rule out the possibility that they wrote the music they wrote in the 90s simply because they liked it, not because they thought it's what would get them the most money. \n\nAs for the Napster thing, it might have been smarter to keep their mouths shut through that ordeal and just let the faceless record companies sort it out, but again, it'd be silly to strive to appease the kinds of people who write them off to this day because, in their minds, you either care about music or you care about money. It's that black and white.\n\nAt the end of the day they've only \"fallen\" in the minds of the aforementioned people. By every other measure they've gone from strength to strength and I can only imagine they see their lives and careers as a hell of a success. Frankly if they'd continued making 80s metal to this day, just to appease those \"hardcore\" fans, then I'd probably be saying they've failed. It wouldn't be authentic and everyone would see through it. It'd be a lose-lose situation."], [8, "I find it an overall accurate summary. \n\nI'm not a fan who was so outside the mainstream that I thought getting on Elektra was a sellout (note the people in this thread claiming the band died with Cliff); I came to Metallica from the mainstream. I was listening to mainstream hard rock & hair metal in the 80's - Van Halen, Scorpions, Def Leppard, Living Color, Dokken, Loudness, Queensryche, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Faith No More, and new wave because I liked new wave girls - the Cure, Depeche Mode, etc. Bands like Maiden and Priest were on my radar but I didn't really dig them beyond what was played on MTV (speaking of which, MTV was my musical savior at that time - I lived in a small city where REO Speedwagon was the hard rock on the radio).\n\nMetallica was my first exposure to thrash - MoP was already out. Checking out them and the rest of the \"big four,\" I became a big fan of Metallica and Anthrax. I became aware of bands like Exodus and Testament and Nuclear Assault but never really got into them.\n\nAFJA came out and it was huge. The songs were amazing, though if you cranked it up too much in the car that weird mix distorted the speakers so badly it sounded like they were about to rip apart. They were being referred to as the Led Zeppelin of their generation - the kings of the hill. We all roared when Lars ripped on the industry for their lack of support at the Grammys and thanked Jethro Tull for not putting out a \"heavy metal\" album that year (they lost out to them prior to the AFJA win).\n\nI bought the Black album on release day. It was fucking amazing. The songs were great, though more concise and to the point than prior albums - the same change other legit bands like Rush had accomplished. But the production. Holy fucking hell, the production was *amazing*. You could hear Jason! The sound was monstrous. \n\n\"Enter Sandman\" was poppy, though good, but quickly suffered from overexposure. \"Nothing Else Matters\" was a freaking ballad, but not in the wimpy hair metal style. \"Sad But True\" made up for all that. The heavier songs not on the radio made up for them. \"The Unforgiven\" took the mellow verse/heavy chorus formula and reversed it, and it worked. It was a good fucking metal record, though yeah, they went through the same \"I liked them before they got big/sold out\" loss of earlier fans that all bands do. I remember reading interviews with James where he joked about it.\n\nThen Load came out. They cut their hair, big fucking deal - I no longer had a mullet, so what? It was the songs that were the problem. It wasn't a metal album - it was a hard rock album. Many of the songs were *okay* but nothing was jaw-dropping. It was a clear move away from metal.\n\nAnother problem with Load - it was too long. They advertised this as a selling point: \"The CD format can hold 80 minutes of music, so we made an album 80 minutes long.\" That was a mistake. It diluted the album's impact; you were (or, I was) tired of it before it finished. Way too much uninteresting filler. I wound up thinking \"Load\" was a very apt title; it was a load, alright.\n\nI held out hope. \"The Memory Remains\" had that horrible old crone on it, but still rocked. \"Fuel\" rocked harder, but then I realized they'd ripped off Anthrax (check out \"Fueled\" from them, released first). They were fading quickly for me.\n\nNapster was the end for me. The internet was the new underground. We were trading music and sharing bands and circumventing The Industry *just like Metallica did in the 80's* but now they had become The Industry. South Park went after them for it. Dexter Holland of the Offspring noted (correctly, I might add) that Napster increased his band's sales - big downloads were big sellers. Metallica had become the old men yelling at those damned kids to get off their lawn.\n\nAnd then they released an album of old material re-recorded with an orchestra.\n\nIf Load put the nail in the coffin, Napster dug the grave and S&M shoveled the dirt onto it.\n\nI was done with them. \"Fuck you, Lars\" was my opinion. I downloaded new Metallica content and then deleted it because Fuck You, Lars. And also it was shit.\n\nSo there's the point of view of someone who was around for all of it. Your experiences may vary.\n\nTl; dr: /u/GreatThunderOwl got it pretty well on the money.

I'm not sure suing was the best way to go about it however it's makes far more dense in that context. "], [2, "I also lived through this and have a different take. \n\nYeah, a lot of people were turned off by Lars's whiny entitled bullshit in the Napster hearings, but by the time that hit we'd already been firmly turned off to the band by Load. \n\nMetallica was *the* quintessential Thrash band. You listened to songs like Jump in the Fire or Creeping Death and they were fucking badass. Sure, even as far back there were the softer tracks- Fade to Black, Sanitarium, etc- but on the whole the band just *oozed* a sort of unbridled attitude that stood out in stark contrast to the vapid poppy nonsense that dominated the airwaves in those days. Even the Black album had some of this feeling, despite the Bob Rock influence- it was softer, for Metallica, but there was still a lot more teeth to it than any of the grunge / alternative that it shared airwaves with. \n\nSo five years later we were in the middle of nu hell. Metal on the radio was whining self hating bullshit- you'd turn on your local Clearchannel bullshit rotation and hear unmitigated trash like Staind and Creed and Nickelback all the fucking time, sighed, and spun up a cd because everything was crap. I mean in those days the only thing you could really hope to hear with any balls to it was fucking Rammstein or Manson, it was bad times. \n\nThen Metallica announced Load, and everyone had a glimmer of hope. The badass Kings of Thrash were coming back, we'd finally have something to counter all of the total shit metal had turned into. It couldn't come soon enough. \n\nI remember going in to the store and picking up my copy of Load. I didn't have a cd player in the car, so I drove home waiting impatiently to hear it. I spun it up and what greeted me was the exact same bullshit I was looking to get away from, more whining self hating CRAP that had taken the place of metal. \n\nThis was the nail in the coffin. The Kings were not just dead, they didn't have the dignity to just fall into obscurity, they became everything they had stood in contrast to. Metal was dead- I wasn't cool enough or connected enough to hear any of the stuff coming out of DM or BM, I had no idea there was anything out there aside from the shit on the radio, so yeah, for me, metal WAS dead. It was another 5+ years before I heard anything new that captured that sound- I saw Iced Earth and Children of Bodom in Seattle in 04 and it was a serious moment of \"where in the FUCK were you guys!?\" \n\n(And how'd I hear about them? Fucking shared mp3s, fuck you, Lars.) \n\nSo yeah. Fuck Metallica. They made some really great music for a long run, but for me they absolutely shit on everything they had been."], [1, "This is so interesting to read, because as someone that grew up in the 90s and reveared Metallica as the fore-bearers of an older era of metal, the break for me was St. Anger, which was just horrible. All over. Just every piece.\n\nAnd it's utterly curious that this post doesn't even mention it. Perhaps it's because that's where the break between Metallica and the mainstream occurred? It's hard to say, but it's an interesting inflection point that the OP doesn't mention to say the least."], [1, "As an extreme metal fan, I don't perceive earlier Metallica albums being heavier than later ones. They are just different.\n\nE.g. [Seek and destroy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-tvJcTPxHc) sounds kinda harsh. But [Wherever I May Roam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwPg8gJq_Kw) is also quite harsh and noisy, and it actually has deeper bass and vocals.\n\nIt seems like people got used to a particular style and were disappointed about deviations from it. Or maybe those early fans were just more into extreme metal than Metallica itself, and thus got disappointed that it didn't move to death/thrash metal.\n\nIn any case this \"rise and fall\" thing is more about fans than about Metallica itself."], [1, "I bought my first Metallica tape in 1986. It was Masters of Puppets, I was 11 years old. I made my first self-directed music decisions based on the kind of hard rock I was hearing on MTV -- Bon Jovi was big, and there was a good dose of LA hard glam in there, like Ratt. I actually got the Metallica sight-unseen (unheard?) based on the cover art and its filing status: Heavy Metal.\n\nThat was pretty great. I started picking up and swapping tapes with other middle-school metalheads. My school was grades 5-8 so I made friends with some of the older kids who were growing out of The Cure and getting into Anthrax and Slayer. Most of them would go on to high school and discover skate boards and hardcore.\n\nI remember getting Metallica bootleg EPs was like a scavenger hunt. Creeping Death and Jump in the Fire were favorites. The songs weren't different, but the artwork and rarity were cool.\n\nJustice was a high-water mark of course. By the time it came out I was really into Maiden and longer, more conceptual metal but still inside that thrash/NWOBHM mold. I wasn't alone. Megadeth's Rust in Peace and Anthrax's Persistence of Time were both getting heavy rotation. \n\nBy the time *I* got to high school something very peculiar happened. Metallica produced a record with Bob Rock, the Black album, which we all ate up like candy because it said Metallica on the cover. It didn't seem like a very big departure. The songs were shorter, but that meant there were more of them.

Metallica didn't even release a new record for 5 fucking years, which is an eternity, and by the time it came out I couldn't care less. It wasn't thrash, it wasn't particularly good. I was 20 or 21 by then. I'd moved on, my tastes had changed, and beyond what I was hearing on rock radio, Metallica wasn't getting the time of day.\n\nBy the time they locked horns with Napster, it was easy to ridicule them and laugh at what weird sell-out fucksticks they were being.\n\nI still listen to Kill 'Em All through Metallica pretty regularly, but Load and beyond?

They even said in interviews that they didn't prepare for it like they usually did, they just went in the studio and jammed it out.\n\nSo maybe I like Master of Puppets better than black album overall, but black album was still likable because it had quality in design.

It simply does not stand to reason that the person credited with only a fraction of songwriting credits can be named the primary reason for the group's success.  Partisans have been saying the same thing about the absence of Dave Mustaine (most notably, Mustaine himself) but it doesn't stand to up to scrutiny for the same reason.  The core songwriting team has always been Hetfield and Ulrich, with other members contributing but rarely having a greater influence than those two.\n\n_Cliff was the one really responsible for Metallica's success_ is one of those things that gets tossed around on reddit, like _George Lucas's wife was the one really responsible for Star Wars_ and _Steve Jobs stole everything from Woz_.

The songs were on the radio constantly. Sandman and Nothing Else Matters were played seemingly endlessly.\n\nSomewhere in here Metallica teamed up with Guns and Roses and Faith No More to tour and that concert was a huge huge deal with my friends and I. That would have been early 90's when we were all in high school and prime age for this.\n\nAfter high school Metallica seemed to fade away for me personally. In 1994 I moved to a new town (Atlanta) and Metallica didn't seem very big there at all, which I attribute perhaps incorrectly to Atlanta having a much higher racial diversity than my previous city (Allentown).\n\nLoad came out somewhere after that and I barely heard about it. I remember hearing Until it Sleeps on the radio, but not nearly in as heavy a rotation as songs from Black. Reload was similarly unexciting.\n\nThen the whole Napster thing happened and Metallica became a laughingstock. Napster was super super popular and having multi-millionare rock start say that it was hurting them financially was just such a stupid statement that people flipped the bit on Metallica and just considered them whiny brats.\n\nI remember a hilarious little flash video that made the rounds where Lars is crawling all over Hetfield and Hetfield is speaks like Frankenstein - 'Napster...

I was listening to mainstream hard rock & hair metal in the 80's - Van Halen, Scorpions, Def Leppard, Living Color, Dokken, Loudness, Queensryche, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Faith No More, and new wave because I liked new wave girls - the Cure, Depeche Mode, etc. Bands like Maiden and Priest were on my radar but I didn't really dig them beyond what was played on MTV (speaking of which, MTV was my musical savior at that time - I lived in a small city where REO Speedwagon was the hard rock on the radio).\n\nMetallica was my first exposure to thrash - MoP was already out. Checking out them and the rest of the \"big four,\" I became a big fan of Metallica and Anthrax. I became aware of bands like Exodus and Testament and Nuclear Assault but never really got into them.\n\nAFJA came out and it was huge. The songs were amazing, though if you cranked it up too much in the car that weird mix distorted the speakers so badly it sounded like they were about to rip apart. They were being referred to as the Led Zeppelin of their generation - the kings of the hill. We all roared when Lars ripped on the industry for their lack of support at the Grammys and thanked Jethro Tull for not putting out a \"heavy metal\" album that year (they lost out to them prior to the AFJA win).\n\nI bought the Black album on release day. It was fucking amazing. The songs were great, though more concise and to the point than prior albums - the same change other legit bands like Rush had accomplished. But the production. Holy fucking hell, the production was *amazing*. You could hear Jason! The sound was monstrous. \n\n\"Enter Sandman\" was poppy, though good, but quickly suffered from overexposure. \"Nothing Else Matters\" was a freaking ballad, but not in the wimpy hair metal style. \"Sad But True\" made up for all that. The heavier songs not on the radio made up for them. \"The Unforgiven\" took the mellow verse/heavy chorus formula and reversed it, and it worked. It was a good fucking metal record, though yeah, they went through the same \"I liked them before they got big/sold out\" loss of earlier fans that all bands do. I remember reading interviews with James where he joked about it.\n\nThen Load came out. They cut their hair, big fucking deal - I no longer had a mullet, so what? It was the songs that were the problem. It wasn't a metal album - it was a hard rock album. Many of the songs were *okay* but nothing was jaw-dropping. It was a clear move away from metal.\n\nAnother problem with Load - it was too long. They advertised this as a selling point: \"The CD format can hold 80 minutes of music, so we made an album 80 minutes long.\" That was a mistake. It diluted the album's impact; you were (or, I was) tired of it before it finished. Way too much uninteresting filler. I wound up thinking \"Load\" was a very apt title; it was a load, alright.\n\nI held out hope. \"The Memory Remains\" had that horrible old crone on it, but still rocked. \"Fuel\" rocked harder, but then I realized they'd ripped off Anthrax (check out \"Fueled\" from them, released first). They were fading quickly for me.\n\nNapster was the end for me. The internet was the new underground. We were trading music and sharing bands and circumventing The Industry *just like Metallica did in the 80's* but now they had become The Industry. South Park went after them for it. Dexter Holland of the Offspring noted (correctly, I might add) that Napster increased his band's sales - big downloads were big sellers. Metallica had become the old men yelling at those damned kids to get off their lawn.\n\nAnd then they released an album of old material re-recorded with an orchestra.\n\nIf Load put the nail in the coffin, Napster dug the grave and S&M shoveled the dirt onto it.\n\nI was done with them. \"Fuck you, Lars\" was my opinion.

You listened to songs like Jump in the Fire or Creeping Death and they were fucking badass. Sure, even as far back there were the softer tracks- Fade to Black, Sanitarium, etc- but on the whole the band just *oozed* a sort of unbridled attitude that stood out in stark contrast to the vapid poppy nonsense that dominated the airwaves in those days. Even the Black album had some of this feeling, despite the Bob Rock influence- it was softer, for Metallica, but there was still a lot more teeth to it than any of the grunge / alternative that it shared airwaves with. \n\nSo five years later we were in the middle of nu hell. Metal on the radio was whining self hating bullshit- you'd turn on your local Clearchannel bullshit rotation and hear unmitigated trash like Staind and Creed and Nickelback all the fucking time, sighed, and spun up a cd because everything was crap. I mean in those days the only thing you could really hope to hear with any balls to it was fucking Rammstein or Manson, it was bad times. \n\nThen Metallica announced Load, and everyone had a glimmer of hope. The badass Kings of Thrash were coming back, we'd finally have something to counter all of the total shit metal had turned into. It couldn't come soon enough. \n\nI remember going in to the store and picking up my copy of Load. I didn't have a cd player in the car, so I drove home waiting impatiently to hear it. I spun it up and what greeted me was the exact same bullshit I was looking to get away from, more whining self hating CRAP that had taken the place of metal. \n\nThis was the nail in the coffin. The Kings were not just dead, they didn't have the dignity to just fall into obscurity, they became everything they had stood in contrast to. Metal was dead- I wasn't cool enough or connected enough to hear any of the stuff coming out of DM or BM, I had no idea there was anything out there aside from the shit on the radio, so yeah, for me, metal WAS dead. It was another 5+ years before I heard anything new that captured that sound- I saw Iced Earth and Children of Bodom in Seattle in 04 and it was a serious moment of \"where in the FUCK were you guys!?\" \n\n(And how'd I hear about them?

The problem isn't as much funding, as how that money is spent. One solution is to federalize the taxes for school districts. Because the worst, most underfunded schools are in ghettoes, the problem becomes cyclical, because poor people can't afford flashy schools.\n\nAnother massive and quite uncomfortable problem is that white Americans do extremely well academically while minorities do much worse (with the exception of Asians I believe).

Without manufacturing and the unstoppably declining demand for low-skill labor, and the current criminal and impoverished state of those areas, makes economic growth very unlikely.\n\n* There are cultural and social problems with attitudes toward education in the ghetto. An appalling number of people in these areas reject education entirely. Coupled with shattered family structures, it's another mammoth problem.

The biggest problem is by far, that they are only really good for some of the less effective teaching methodes.", "id": "d8g7bde"}, {"comment": "Reliability, touch recognition accuracy and usability are still lacking, to the point where they oftentimes simply were not usable. The technology just didn't seem sufficiently mature to me (admittedly this was a few years ago).", "id": "d8gar29"}, {"comment": "I don't think it is about maturity of the technology. The biggest problem is in my opinion that the methodes where you would use them is some of the less effective when it comes to teaching. I expect that you have some teacher training, but because this is debthub, I'm going to add some context for non-teachers to better understand some of the problems with smartboards.\n\nSo first of I am a trained teacher from Denmark, which means that some of my ideas when it comes to teaching and my experience might be different from other peoples.\n\nTo understand good teaching you need to understand how people learn and form memories. Memories aren't stored as in a computer with one piece of knowledge stored at a single place. Simplified memories are stored more like webs of associations. So for example when you think \"strawberry\" it activates a part of your brain that remembers red, but also a part that remembers the taste, sweat in general, how it looks, how you would draw it, how the word \"strawberry\" sounds, the recipies you would use it in, the salat you once ate with strawberries in and so on. You can train these associations, by using them and if they are never used they slowly disappeare(That is our current belief, but research is still being done on that part). The more associations and the stronger associations, the stronger you remember it. You remember something better when you do it, because doing instead of listening builds more associations.\n\nNow this makes good sense. The more times you hear something, the better the chance you remember it, we have all tried to remember something by associating it to something familiar and hopefully we all know that to learn something you have to actuelly do it.\n\nOne of the big problem in teaching though is concentration and attention. Humans are simply not made to listen to a single person for a long time while sitting down, so we could use this information in 10 years time. A teacher might be talking, but the student might simply not be listening. The worst part is that the student might not be in control. If you have ever lost attention, while at a lecture you knew was really importent, then you know what I mean.\n\nThese two things combined means that lecture based education is really bad. The student will have a hard time paying attention and he or she will not proces the information in such a way that it is easy to remember. There are some good ways to make lectures more effective, like by taking notes you trick your brain to believe that the information is vital for you right now, because else you can't write it down! The act of writing the information down also increases the numbers of associations, so the information you write down is easier to remember.\n\nNow this doesn't change the fact that lectures are a really ineffective way of teaching. Sometimes some kind of instruction is needed, but the more active you can make the student, the better they will remember what they learn. There is lots of methodes for making students more active, from hands-on activities to cooperative learning and student-central learning.\n\nSmartboards on the other hand is a lot about the teacher. The teacher becomes the central part of the classroom and the learning and that actuelly means that the students learn less.

One of the most telling things I came across was a blog from a high school principle in the US. He wrote about noticing how his school's costs were rising after bringing in the devices, and that the costs were going to buying ant-fatigue mats for the teachers. Mats designed to reduce stress on the legs for people who have to stand in one place for a long time. Exactly the opposite of what you want an effective and engaging teacher to be doing.\n\nSince then, across a number of different education companies, I've seen some teachers use them very effectively. In language classes, or courses where there is a lot of discussion, being able to store multiple pages of board notes generated during the class that are then emailed to students afterwards is a really nice feature. Mostly they tend to go underutilized, and I wouldn't blame the teachers for that.

If we look at people who actually have lots of opportunities, like women in other countries, they often take advantage of these opportunities. It seems odd that they would do this if it just leaves them less happy, but then why do they report lower levels of happiness? The answer is that they don't have to deceive themselves and convince themselves they're happy with their limited lot. They can be exactly as happy as men are, and if you think that men would be happier if they were forced into a subordinated position, just give it a try on the men. Because the men haven't grown up with no freedom, they don't have warped preferences, and they don't tell themselves they'd be happier stuck at home with no rights, so when you try to take their rights away, they go batshit, just like the women would go batshit if they realized they're just lying to themselves.\n\nI don't want to claim that this is what's going on in Saudi Arabia - I have no particular expertise with respect to that situation.

Since we're already on depthhub and I hate verbosity for it's own sake I'll try to summarize a 5,000 word lit review...\n\nSo. Throughout basically the entire western world we basically take it for granted that women as a group are more liberal than men by a nontrivial degree.\n\nBut the thing is it wasn't always so. This is actually a recent phenomena that started in the US roughly around the end of the Vietnam war and spread throughout the west as countries reached an advanced postindustrial economy (See Inglehart and Norris' *developmental theory of the gender gap*). Before that women were noticeably more *conservative* than men throughout the west, and they still are throughout much of the developing world.\n\nTying into this is other research showing that even in the west where women are politically more liberal they still tend to be more conservative in other ways. Women as a whole show lesser tolerance for political outgroups, political uncertainty, and potential threats (See work from Golebiowska as well as Togeby).\n\nHere's where I skip going into about 50 different articles (and a book or two) from the last 40 years and summarize the plot:\n\nIn everything from subsistence up through developing economies where a majority of work is still industrial in nature women tend to support conservative ideologies which enforce traditional structures in which men work and are exposed to danger while women are supported and run the home. We saw this even in the west (most notably with White Feather feminists during WW1, and the massive anti-ERA uprising when the draft was brought up) all the way up to recent times.\n\nIn a postindustrial economy women instead tend to support liberal ideologies with strong social safety nets and social welfare policies. Instead of supporting traditional structures where men of a family provide for the women of that family they instead support state enacts policies which provide for women in general.\n\nShifting from observed evidence to my theoretical interpretations, I've argued this is because of three major factors: Modern birth control allows women to live without constantly getting pregnant, women can participate far more fully in postindustrial economies than in economies heavy on hard labor*, and in much of the west women are the overwhelming majority of custodial single parents.\n\nBecause of these and the simple medical fact women bear children social welfare policies disproportionately affect women, explaining the greater support than men.\n\nSome arab states such as Saudi Arabia are pretty bloody rich. But they also suffer from extreme inequality which cuts off much of their population from that wealth, as well as instability, violence, and widespread poverty and illiteracy. The difference between a major city and a small village can be like the difference between the US and Somalia. But like servetusm mentions it's men who bear the brunt of that violence and brutality while sheltering women in their families.\n\nSo while women in Saudi Arabia objectively have a shitty deal and the men appear to us to have more rights/freedoms, *within their society* the women have a less personal freedoms as we consider them in the west but a LOT more personal security from the overall violence and poverty in their society. The truth is on the whole neither me nnor women in Saudi Arabia have any rights. Saudi Arabia is a murderous dictatorship with brutally violent religious police and a government that has no problems torturing and killing. \n\nIt's just that we're conditioned to viewing the world in a certain way (eg rape and pakistani boys) and part of that is that we just don't give a fuck about thousands of men being slaughtered or maimed and mutilated.\n\nRemember \"Bring back our girls\"? How many people even know about their male classmates who were burned to death? Was there a \"bring back our boys\" when the taliban kidnapped a bus full of boys for child soldiers and sex slaves? Did anyone report on Boko Haram systematically committing gendercide by killing every man and male child they found?\n\nWomen in Saudi Arabia aren't allowed to drive and get lashed for being rape victims, but in 2015 alone almost 160 people (I'd bet all men) had their heads cut off.\n\nThen we come along and tell Saudi women \"Hey don't you want to live like men?\" and they look at the public beheadings, torture, mass imprisonment, poverty and homelessness (even in the US it's 70-90% male), and say \"Fuck no.\"\n\n\n*In much of the west an average man and woman of the same size and weight picked off the street are both so un-fit and overweight as to be essentially equals in strength and stamina. When you actually look at physically strenuous situations however the picture changes. In the military women that are held to the same combat fitness standard as men suffer from vastly higher rates of injuries such as stress fractures and hip dysplasia. Even among olympic athletes, who are at the very peak of human physical achievement, the top placing women rarely come close to lower placing men.\n\n"], [15, "While I'm not sure that I agree with the post nor all of the reasoning, it helped me see an alternative perspective on the issue that I previously had never thought of.

However, generally the reported life satisfaction of people in poor urban industrial communities is lower than that of people in poor rural agricultural communities - but the economic transformation that drove them to the cities has basically eliminated the choice to be a poor rural agriculturalist in the way that they were before.

Unlike the doctor example, where the medication is being forced on you, supporters of adaptive preference formation explanations of preferences for oppression generally just want to remove the oppression and then let people make choices. If they subsequently put the oppression back, that's fine (it's not even oppression, then, once they've freely chosen it), but the idea is that they need to get a chance to make the decision in a context where they have the option to choose otherwise, because if they don't have options, they'll just prefer what they can get (sour grapes).\n\n> Saudi Arabia definitely has a problem with the way it treats women, but the answer to their disempowerment isn't to disempower those have women from having a voice where we are as well.\n\nI don't think I ever said the answer to a single problem in the entire history of the universe is to disempower women from having a voice where \"we\" are as well.", "id": "d84wwcc"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d83wbnk"}], [{"comment": "So this is actually a much more complicated issue than JUST Saudi Arabia, and ties into the ideological gender gap. Since we're already on depthhub and I hate verbosity for it's own sake I'll try to summarize a 5,000 word lit review...\n\nSo. Throughout basically the entire western world we basically take it for granted that women as a group are more liberal than men by a nontrivial degree.\n\nBut the thing is it wasn't always so. This is actually a recent phenomena that started in the US roughly around the end of the Vietnam war and spread throughout the west as countries reached an advanced postindustrial economy (See Inglehart and Norris' *developmental theory of the gender gap*). Before that women were noticeably more *conservative* than men throughout the west, and they still are throughout much of the developing world.\n\nTying into this is other research showing that even in the west where women are politically more liberal they still tend to be more conservative in other ways. Women as a whole show lesser tolerance for political outgroups, political uncertainty, and potential threats (See work from Golebiowska as well as Togeby).\n\nHere's where I skip going into about 50 different articles (and a book or two) from the last 40 years and summarize the plot:\n\nIn everything from subsistence up through developing economies where a majority of work is still industrial in nature women tend to support conservative ideologies which enforce traditional structures in which men work and are exposed to danger while women are supported and run the home. We saw this even in the west (most notably with White Feather feminists during WW1, and the massive anti-ERA uprising when the draft was brought up) all the way up to recent times.\n\nIn a postindustrial economy women instead tend to support liberal ideologies with strong social safety nets and social welfare policies. Instead of supporting traditional structures where men of a family provide for the women of that family they instead support state enacts policies which provide for women in general.\n\nShifting from observed evidence to my theoretical interpretations, I've argued this is because of three major factors: Modern birth control allows women to live without constantly getting pregnant, women can participate far more fully in postindustrial economies than in economies heavy on hard labor*, and in much of the west women are the overwhelming majority of custodial single parents.\n\nBecause of these and the simple medical fact women bear children social welfare policies disproportionately affect women, explaining the greater support than men.\n\nSome arab states such as Saudi Arabia are pretty bloody rich. But they also suffer from extreme inequality which cuts off much of their population from that wealth, as well as instability, violence, and widespread poverty and illiteracy. The difference between a major city and a small village can be like the difference between the US and Somalia. But like servetusm mentions it's men who bear the brunt of that violence and brutality while sheltering women in their families.\n\nSo while women in Saudi Arabia objectively have a shitty deal and the men appear to us to have more rights/freedoms, *within their society* the women have a less personal freedoms as we consider them in the west but a LOT more personal security from the overall violence and poverty in their society. The truth is on the whole neither me nnor women in Saudi Arabia have any rights. Saudi Arabia is a murderous dictatorship with brutally violent religious police and a government that has no problems torturing and killing. \n\nIt's just that we're conditioned to viewing the world in a certain way (eg rape and pakistani boys) and part of that is that we just don't give a fuck about thousands of men being slaughtered or maimed and mutilated.\n\nRemember \"Bring back our girls\"? How many people even know about their male classmates who were burned to death? Was there a \"bring back our boys\" when the taliban kidnapped a bus full of boys for child soldiers and sex slaves? Did anyone report on Boko Haram systematically committing gendercide by killing every man and male child they found?\n\nWomen in Saudi Arabia aren't allowed to drive and get lashed for being rape victims, but in 2015 alone almost 160 people (I'd bet all men) had their heads cut off.\n\nThen we come along and tell Saudi women \"Hey don't you want to live like men?\" and they look at the public beheadings, torture, mass imprisonment, poverty and homelessness (even in the US it's 70-90% male), and say \"Fuck no.\"\n\n\n*In much of the west an average man and woman of the same size and weight picked off the street are both so un-fit and overweight as to be essentially equals in strength and stamina. When you actually look at physically strenuous situations however the picture changes. In the military women that are held to the same combat fitness standard as men suffer from vastly higher rates of injuries such as stress fractures and hip dysplasia.

In that case, it was most certainly a context of oppression and was (in time) denounced. While some of that sense of coercion still remains, it is largely contained within the one, small group: nuns.

Because of this, general societal pressure is slowly but surely taking care of many of the issues Catholics have with women's rights - Catholic men and women are doing that work themselves.

But I believe that, while we shouldn't ignore such things, we should focus most of our attention on the more egregious forms of inequality.\n\nTake most of America for an example. While we do face some inequalities in dress standards - the expectation to wear makeup and like dresses, the shirt thing, etc - those standards are most clearly not as harmful - as a whole - as the dress standards in strongly Muslim or other uber conservative places. A woman who chooses not to wear makeup will have some nasty comments to deal with, some very hurtful attitudes and may even have to deal with this effecting her professional life or choice of partners. But, in professional settings, she does have legal recourse. Disclaimer: I'm in my late 20s and have never worn makeup outside of some experiments in middle school. I rarely wear dresses and never heels. Etc. I am painfully aware of just how harmful these attitudes can be and are. I've dealt with a lot of crap and been very hurt by these expectations.\n\nBut...I know that this is most definitely not the same level, or even *close* to what women in the Middle East, particularly the most conservative portions, go through with the hijab. I lived in Morocco for a bit. I spoke mostly with other adults my age. And I can see the changes happening there. But Morocco has far stronger ties to Europe than the fast majority of Islamic countries. And even there, it has a serious impact on a woman's prospects. Most of the women still wear headcoverings, and they all *must* if they wish to enter a mosque. They cannot practice their faith without adhering to that standard. They are very much regarded as \"easy\" (just like Western women!) for not wearing a hijab. Their modesty is directly tied to their sexual status. A man who attacks a covered woman may face repercussions, from her family or the law. She will still be tainted, but something may actually be done. If she is uncovered? It is extremely unlikely something will be done by anyone. Her own family may join those who say she got what she deserves. I've met Muslim men who have actively denigrated women who didn't wear a hijab, etc. Even Western women are judged this way.", "id": "d840651"}, {"comment": ">  However, wearing shirt is closer to an equal standard than wearing headcovering\n\nThis is how people dress in Saudi Arabia: http://www.bankerinthesun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/A-Saudi-Arabian-couple-in-traditional-clothes.jpg\n\nBoth man and woman have headcovering.

It is more conservative than the West, but does that make it intrinsically wrong? As long as they are making the decision as freely as a woman in the west does when she covers her boobs (or a guy who cover his dick), I'm OK with it to the extend I'm OK with it in our culture.\n\n> If she is uncovered? It is extremely unlikely something will be done by anyone\n\nWe see the same in the west. If a drunken whore is raped her case will be taken with a grain of salt compared to an upstanding respectable college student. Not saying this is a good thing, but can we really judge them too harshly when we can't get our own camp in order?\n\nThis is a bit beyond the point I was making anyway. A woman dresses herself, if she chooses to wear Hijab, we should be OK with that. Womans liberation isn't just the freedom to go nude, it's also to go out looking like a tent.\n\n>  I've met Muslim men who have actively denigrated women who didn't wear a hijab, etc. Even Western women are judged this way.\n\nThe socially conservative man is a plague the world over.", "id": "d840q72"}, {"comment": "That is traditional dress, but that is not the way the average way that a man in Saudi Arabia dresses.

Your experience is not representative - especially since there are many more non-Catholics in America than Catholics.\n\nFurthermore, your assertion that most women do not live in bad countries of the Middle East is simply false. Even in more liberal countries like Turkey and Morocco, these large, institutionalized forms of oppression exist. Morocco is about as liberal as the Middle East gets, and yet, I saw this played out every day. I had open and frank discussions with young Muslim women about gender equality *in their experiences*. Not in the abstract, but in reality. It is part of daily life, even in the increasingly Westernized cities.\n\nAt no point have I ever said those double standards don't exist in the West. They do. It is more extreme in certain areas of the world, the Middle East being the one we're discussing. Saying that it happens elsewhere does not lessen the claims of injustice in the case of the hijab. Two wrongs do not, and will not, make a right.\n\nI've experienced some amount of harassment or catcalls in America since I was old enough to be called a woman. Those did not compare to the sheer volume of such catcalls I received in Morocco or heard given to any uncovered female.

If you say too much, you'll get your story crossed at some point and end up landing yourself in jail. \n\nFrom there, basically keep your purchases under the radar. People start asking questions if you all of a sudden inherit a lot of money after someone else goes missing. Dealing in cash is smart. Extricate yourself from the situation after a \"mourning\" grace period. Disappearing a week later is fishy. Act like nothing has changed, minus your friend went missing. You might have to sit on the money for years until you can launder it somehow. Casino winnings are an easy way to explain things. Let everyone know you're going to the casino, hire a few high class hookers, buy yourself one of those big cardboard cheques. Get a picture of the beautiful ladies handing you said cheque with your \"winnings\" written on it. Most people won't do the background work to find the casino you supposedly won at, and the photo with the cheque is enough explanation for them. Tadaa!

The thieves spiked Whittaker's drink with prescription drugs in the first instance. The second incident was the handiwork of his granddaughter's friends, who had been probing the girl for details on Whittaker's cash for weeks.\n\nWikipedia's version:\n\n>On August 5, 2003, less than a year after Whittaker won the lottery, thieves broke into his car while it was parked at a strip club in Cross Lanes, West Virginia. The thieves made away with $545,000 in cash that Whittaker carried around in a suitcase.  When asked why he would carry that much money around with him Whittaker responded \"because I can\".\n\n>In another incident, two employees at the club, the general manager and a dancer-manager who were romantically linked, were arrested and charged with a plot to put drugs in Whittaker's drinks and then rob him.  On January 25, 2004, thieves once again broke into his car, this time making off with an estimated $200,000 in cash, but this was later recovered.\n\nOP's version:\n\n>Whittaker's wife filed for divorce, and in the process froze a number of his assets and the accounts of his operating companies. Caesars in Atlantic City sued him for $1.5 million to cover bounced checks, caused by the asset freeze.\n\nWikipedia's version:\n\n>Whittaker was later sued by Caesars Atlantic City casino for bouncing $1.5 million worth of checks to cover gambling losses.

It seemed like the only folks who WERE happy was a family of Vietnamese immigrants who used the money to build a ranch to bring over their extended family from Vietnam.\n\nThe underlying premise is that if you earn $100 million building a business, people are less likely to resent you for it/beg for handouts/try to steal it than if you win $100 in the lottery.", "id": "cyxbtcr"}, {"comment": "That is because on your way to building that business, you cut fuckheads out of your life and they know it is deserved. Lottery on the other hand I feel that you never had the chance to get the point across.", "id": "cyxcabg"}, {"comment": "I think that's both on point to some degree and missing some other factors to the whole picture.  \n\nSomeone who's become very successful through business often find their peer group changes as their fortunes do - you start hanging out with other business high-rollers rather than Steve from shop class '74, your social circle ends up being a bunch of people generally of equivalent wealth and success to yourself.  And for those others, family members or old friends or what have you, they're easier to cut out, to avoid, and to occasionally decline.  \n\nAnd when you get big, over time, \"naturally\", you do get practiced at cutting people out and shutting them down when the stakes are much lower.  Not only are they used to the fact that you're never going to help them launch their dream of a craft pickle business, but you've had enough practice saying no to other people that you're able to do so this time with a bunch of tact and sensitivity.  But similarly, their feelings of investment, their feeling of entitlement to earned wealth are lower than towards won wealth.  \n\nBut part of the thing with lottery winners is that it's *luck*.  A lot of people around a winner feel that because the winner got lucky and they didn't, the winner owes them somehow - or at least isn't as fully entitled to their wealth as someone who \"earned\" it.  So while not nearly enough people struggle with asking for money from their cousin who busted it to get successful and wealthy by hard work and talent ... with lotto winnings, they're way more comfortable and way more entitled about the won money.  After all, you didn't *earn* it.  \n\nSo not only has a winner not had a chance to cut out toxic people - people who might well have been great friends when they were on more equal terms - but they don't have the skills to turn them down with grace, even if they have the spine to say no to \"sharing the good fortune\" with an old friend.  So not only does old friend go away empty handed, but their feelings and their pride and their understanding of the relationship all dented and hurt alongside.  \n\nAnd everyone they're surrounded by is pretty much in the same boat.  All too many of the people who're surrounding any of us at any given time would feel like maybe we owed them \"just a little bit\" of our winnings.  It's much harder to say no to any one if you've given to any other, and there's all sorts of folks in your life who'd love to see you share your fortune.  Your mum would be disappointed if you didn't share with your siblings, your dad if you didn't share with them, and this or that family member thinks that cousins should get some and so on.  They all gang up on the lottery winner - with more conventional success, your peer group is people who don't need to hit you up for money and whose support will insulate you from any substantial consequence to declining the few remaining in your life.  \n\nAnd getting rich by working hard isn't particularly glamourous or newsworthy.  None of your old friends really know what you're up to other than \"busy\" and \"looks like he's doing good on Facebook\" and with nothing meaningful having 'changed' to either's perception, there's no cause for them to want to reconnect.  But win big, and your name is in the papers all over town - county, state, nation.  I mean, everyone is gonna be curious AF who wins this pot and where they end up.  So suddenly all these people formerly connected to you remember you and that connection and think you *won* that money so there's no harm in just asking you to spread the luck a little...  So a whole lot more people are both aware that you have money you didn't \"earn\" and that makes them more comfortable asking for it, and unashamedly working all other angles to try and lean on you to just give them *a little* of your fortune.  Your best friend from second grade befriends your mum all of a sudden, waxing sentimental about the old days and the like.  If you won't listen to them, maybe they can get the ear of someone you do listen to.  \n\nAnd if persuasion doesn't work, good ol' litigation certainly can.  Everyone you've ever wounded any way any how is now looking for a settlement.  I mean, it's revenge and cash.  Half of them are going to offer settlements low enough they think you'll just buy them off.  The other half want to milk as hard as possible.  Your newfound fame put a target on your wealth in a way that a conventionally wealthy person is isolated and insulated from - and those threats come in a scale and volume that the conventionally wealthy don't ever need to deal with.  Money-grabbing nuisance suits are indeed commonplace for the wealthy, but never in enough volume to truly swamp a retained lawyer.  \n\nAnd in a pot on this scale, none of these things are really insulating factors for almost anyone - the change in wealth *scale* alone would exceed almost any possible winner's own social circle and would leave them just as prone to all the things that OP brought up.  No matter where you are, won wealth isn't seen by the people around you the same as earned money is, and that's the bulk of the threat.

I guess this is the case when you're engaging in idle chit-chat with strangers at the checkout counter or in an elevator, but I think other forms (say, someone you just met that your friend introduced you to) have a different subtext.\n\nMy own interpretation of small-talk is that it's sort of the awkward exposition that leads into a conversation. You talk about low stakes things, but offer up deeper topics to see if the conversation partner will bite:\n\n>1: \"Boy isn't the weather great?\"\n\n>2: \"I prefer rain actually.\"\n\nNow 1 could just shrug this off and the conversation might come to a quick close.

That's kind of the defining feature of introversion... it takes a lot more mental energy to socialize.\n\nThink of it like a battery. An introvert and extrovert both start the day fully charged at 100%. As they go through the day, small talk happens. Extroverts take little energy to engage in small talk, or are often even recharged by it, letting them spend more energy elsewhere. For an introvert, it is draining... a little here, a little there, and soon the battery down to 30%, and they're only halfway through the day. Introverts need alone time to recharge.\n\nIt's not about misunderstanding the purpose of small talk. It's about it taking a lot more effort for introverts to engage in it, so the cost to benefit ration is completely different for introverts and extroverts. It's not surprising to find that introverts often don't like it, when it costs so much more to participate in it, and the rewards are either the same, or much less."], [14, "I think that's certainly part of it. Most of the time, when engaging in small talk, I'm essentially interviewing the other person. Maybe this has a bit to do with my sales background, but people get uncomfortable when there are lags in the conversation, and if you can sit in that discomfort more, they'll open up.\n\nWhich isn't to suggest you should manipulate people in that way, it's just an interesting dynamic. Part of what OP misses, I think, with respect to small talk, is that it's most often a way to get beyond the sports team questions and into the fun stuff. Especially with folks you don't know (and a couple of beers), it can lead all sorts of places."], [11, "As yet another introvert who dislikes small-talk, as a general life skill, it's really worth sucking it up and getting good at it.\n\nWhen I was in college, I wasn't particularly social. I wanted to be, but I wasn't.  I ended up joining a frat (not because I wanted to be social, but because all my friends joined and I liked the brothers, house, etc).  Much like with a workplace environment, I ended up shoulder to shoulder with a bunch of disparate people that I really didn't have much in common with, aside from Super Smash Bros and the desire to have a great frat experience.  Building off of this, I figured that even though I hated small-talk, it has a small value in making others feel wanted. Everyone wants attention, everyone wants to feel included, so I was willing to \"play the game\", so to say, because even though not everyone there was worthy friend material, I recognized that all of our experiences in that house would be much better if we all got along.  I'd say it worked.\n\nNow that I'm in an office environment, it's easy to feel isolated tucked away in my office.  Small-talk helps me bridge the gap with others, and my workplace is much more diverse than my frat was.  I caught on that everyone else wanted to get along as well, and so far it has greatly benefited me, even though all I try to do is offer a few words upon seeing someone.  \n\nFor those who still aren't convinced, introverts in particular need to exert more effort into being social in order to maintain a good rep at the workplace. It sucks, I know, but you'll be passed over for promotions and accolades and such if you don't have a presence. Your contributions will be ignored or forgotten if people don't think about you very much.  It's not wrong to soft manipulate others by being nice, acknowledging them, and giving them attention, and it helps you just as much as it helps them.  Not every connection needs to be a lifelong friendship, and you never know when someone will help you out just because you seem like a nice person to them.  It really isn't hard to remember a few details about each person you interact with on a daily basis, either.

Emphatic... related?\n\nThe answer is yes and no. It is yes if you go back far enough in time (like back to 5000 BCE) to the language that became Greek, which we call Indo-European. This is the basis behind Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit, so it gave rise to languages all the way from Celtic to Germanic to Latinate to Hindi to Arabic. However, after Greek really takes shape (let's say around 2500BCE), two roots emerged out of one. So in Indo-European they're related; by the time you get to Greek, they'd become something different enough that they function as different words for the most part.\n\nThe word \"phatic\" comes from the Greek adjective \"phatos\" which means \"spoken\" and comes from the word \"phemi\" which means \"I speak.\" The word \"emphatic\" comes from the word \"emphaino,\" which means \"I narrate, explain\" and comes from the word \"phaino\" which means \"bring to light, cause to appear\" or just \"appear.\" Examples of this word root in use in English are \"phenomenon\" (literally, that which has appeared) or \"epiphany\" (literally, \"come into view). Even the word \"fantasy\" is distantly related to \"phainein.\"\n\nBoth phemi and phainen come from the Indo-European root \"pha\" or even earlier \"bha\" which means \"light.\" Both Greek words are about revelation, and that idea of light is still there in \"phainein\" but is mostly gone from \"phemi.\"\n\nVery interesting question!\n\n", "id": "d3zr6uv"}, {"comment": "Very cool how the different languages are related when you go back far enough. \n\nLanguage evolution is very intriguing in how the original idea linked to a sound is carried over to more complex constructs. \n\nThis process of extrapolating from initial roots always conjured for me an idea of an ancient \"counsel of language\" that would define how new concepts are named; only of course it actually is a more adhoc process over many generations. \n\nThreading and reconstructing all that is like a giant puzzle.", "id": "d3zu7wo"}, {"comment": "I definitely wish that people like us could be in the majority instead of having to listen to the neurotypicals lecture us about how *unsocial* we are.

In my experience people, when people initiate in this phatic small talk OP described, they're not only performing \"social grooming\" but also looking for a hook to move the conversation to the solidarity talk aspect of small talk. That hook, however, has to lead to a conversation that's easy to follow and relate to. For example:\n\nPerson 1: \"Hey, how are you?\"  \nPerson 2: \"I'm doing great, just got back from Europe!\"  \nPerson 1: \"Oh awesome where did you go?\"\n\nIn this case, Person 1 can immediately connect to 2 with an obvious follow up question that opens the door for more casual conversation hooks. \"How was it? How long were you there for? I'm so jealous, welcome back to the grind.\"\n\nHowever, if the hook leads to a place where person 1 is not easy to or uncomfortable providing support, the hook is too heavy and will make the conversation feel forced.\n\nPerson 1: \"Hey, how are you?\"  \nPerson 2: \"Not great, I have a bad stomach ache.\"\nPerson 1: \"Uhh... Sorry to hear that.\"\n\nAll of the sudden person 1 is put into a situation where they have to consider if they are making 2's situation worse by being there and continuing the conversation or if they are now obligated to assist in a way they were unprepared to or their relationship doesn't comfortably allow. Is Person 1 supposed to drive out to the store to get Tums? Are they supposed to not share a story they are excited about because it would make the other person remember how bad they have it?\n\nNow in that last situation, Person 2 can turn a heavy hook into an appropriate casual hook by immediately taking over the conversation and deflecting the uncomfortable-ness from his conversation partner:\n\nPerson 1: \"Hey, how are you?\"  \nPerson 2: \"Not great, honestly. Have been feeling sick. But I'll get over it, how about you? How are you?\"  \nPerson 1: \"Sorry to hear that. I've been doing well...\"\n\nIn this case, Person 1 feels absolved of any responsibility to do something they may feel uncomfortable doing.\n\nAnd, of course, if the conversation goes something like this:\n\nPerson 1: \"Hey, how are you?\"  \nPerson 2: \"Fine, yourself?\"  \nPerson 2: \"Fine.\"\n\nYou can sense the awkwardness there.

An introvert and extrovert both start the day fully charged at 100%. As they go through the day, small talk happens. Extroverts take little energy to engage in small talk, or are often even recharged by it, letting them spend more energy elsewhere. For an introvert, it is draining... a little here, a little there, and soon the battery down to 30%, and they're only halfway through the day.

I wanted to be, but I wasn't.  I ended up joining a frat (not because I wanted to be social, but because all my friends joined and I liked the brothers, house, etc).  Much like with a workplace environment, I ended up shoulder to shoulder with a bunch of disparate people that I really didn't have much in common with, aside from Super Smash Bros and the desire to have a great frat experience.  Building off of this, I figured that even though I hated small-talk, it has a small value in making others feel wanted. Everyone wants attention, everyone wants to feel included, so I was willing to \"play the game\", so to say, because even though not everyone there was worthy friend material, I recognized that all of our experiences in that house would be much better if we all got along.  I'd say it worked.\n\nNow that I'm in an office environment, it's easy to feel isolated tucked away in my office.  Small-talk helps me bridge the gap with others, and my workplace is much more diverse than my frat was.  I caught on that everyone else wanted to get along as well, and so far it has greatly benefited me, even though all I try to do is offer a few words upon seeing someone.  \n\nFor those who still aren't convinced, introverts in particular need to exert more effort into being social in order to maintain a good rep at the workplace. It sucks, I know, but you'll be passed over for promotions and accolades and such if you don't have a presence. Your contributions will be ignored or forgotten if people don't think about you very much.  It's not wrong to soft manipulate others by being nice, acknowledging them, and giving them attention, and it helps you just as much as it helps them.  Not every connection needs to be a lifelong friendship, and you never know when someone will help you out just because you seem like a nice person to them.  It really isn't hard to remember a few details about each person you interact with on a daily basis, either.

It's a good place to start because those may be the criteria but every single one of those principles has grey areas - that is what gets blurry. Each of those principles outlines has links to further articles that explore those concepts and their grey areas. \n\nI'll say this - viruses happen to touch on the gray areas for many of those concepts. So by understanding those seven processes you have the founding information you need to start exploring *how* it gets blurry. \n\nSo for all the criteria given in that link, how do viruses fit in?\n\n> 1\\. Homeostasis: regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, sweating to reduce temperature\n\nViruses don't have any \"internal environment\" to speak of - they utilize a host environment. However other parasites, even simple ones like bacteria, do satisfy this one. You could even blur this line with something like a [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion#Origin_and_evolution), which is technically an organelle but is theorized by some to have once been a simple bacterium that became symbiotic with early eukaryotic organisms. Mitochondria maintain very specific gradients of molecules to function.\n\n> 2\\. Organization: being structurally composed of one or more cells \u2014 the basic units of life\n\nAgain, viruses and viroids do not satisfy this point (cells have membranes.) That said, many viruses do have an [envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope) which is a functional equivalent. Viruses are also highly organized when encapsulated/enveloped, but a big difference is that they are self-assembling based on the physical properties of their constituent molecules rather than assembled by a physical apparatus.\n\n>3\\. Metabolism: transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components (anabolism) and decomposing organic matter (catabolism). Living things require energy to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life.\n\nViruses *have a need* for this one in order to exist and function, but they are entirely dependent on their hosts for it to happen. So...they hit on this point, just not in the way everything else does. Does that mean they aren't alive, just because they aren't entirely self-sustaining? There are many other parasites that aren't entirely self-sustaining on this point either.\n\n>4\\. Growth: maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter.\n\nSee point 3 about viral dependence on host metabolism for this gray area. It's inextricably linked.\n\n>5\\. Adaptation: the ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of evolution and is determined by the organism's heredity, diet, and external factors.\n\nViruses are 100% subject to evolutionary processes and adapt in exactly the same ways that other simple cellular organisms like bacteria and single-celled eukaryotes do. In a way, viruses are *most* extremely subject to this as they are entirely dependent on those \"outside processes\" to function. If their coat protein or effector genes mutate to become nonfunctional, they can't do jack. However because it's those same proteins, for example, that host cells use to develop immune response, there is specific selection pressure on the virus for mutations that maintain function while introducing structural variation of the proteins. There are also some really freaking interesting pathosystems with [multipartite viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipartite_virus) and [synergistic viruses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC156963/) that introduce even more complexity into this \"adaptation\" process.\n \n>6\\. Response to stimuli: a response can take many forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun (phototropism), and chemotaxis.\n\nViruses absolutely can respond to stimuli: \"dormant\" virus reactivation. See [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2753116/). \n\n>7\\. Reproduction: the ability to produce new individual organisms, either asexually from a single parent organism or sexually from two parent organisms.\n\nAgain, viruses are totally and completely dependent on their hosts for this one, but they *do* reproduce. But what does \"the ability\" mean, exactly? Lots of parasites/symbionts are dependent to some degree on another organism to reproduce and complete their own life cycle. Viruses just happen to be the most extreme case where they *entirely* depend on the host machinery to do it.

In my own opinion,  which is shared by pretty much every other virologist I've met,  they'd fall into the 'non-living' category as judged by our current ideas of what life is.   The obligate intracellular parasites argument is good but there are other such parasites such as some bacteria.   What truly makes viruses non-life in my eyes is their universal inability to produce either their own protein or energy independently (ie they need their host to do it for them).

We tend to pay far more attention to the controversial predictions of one man (Peter Wadham, in this case) over the more conservative forecasts of the broader scientific community.\n\nWadham was wrong about 2016, but the reasons behind his prediction remain sound. It's not just that the area of ocean covered by ice is shrinking. It's also that the composition of that ice has changed. Most of the thick, durable, multi-year ice \u2013 the kind of ice you can land a plane on \u2013 has gone. What's left is fragile. The Arctic ice cap's days are definitely numbered.\n\nTake a look at what's happening now. This graph shows the latest data:\n\nhttp://web.nersc.no/WebData/arctic-roos.org/observation/ssmi1_ice_ext.png\n\nThe grey bar is the old normal, and the various lines show you what's been happening in recent years.\n\nThe graph shows a dramatic dip in summer sea ice extent in 2012, and this is what let Prof Wadham to get excited and make his prediction about 2016. But the sea ice went on to recover fairly quickly, and hasn't reached that low again.\n\nBut now look at 2016. We didn't have quite the dramatic dip of 2012, but it was still pretty bad, and then look at how much poorer the *recovery* has been. We may not have a had a record summer, but it seems to be shaping up for a record winter, and there's no particular reason to think this trend won't continue.\n\nThis is happening. The people who live on the edges of the ice fields see it with their own eyes. Precise climate change forecasts are a mug's game, as Prof Waham learned to his cost, but the trend is impossible to ignore.\n\n> http://www.sciencealert.com/a-mini-ice-age-is-coming-in-the-next-15-years\n\nThat's interesting, but I won't put too much weight on one model proposed by one mathematician just yet, just as I didn't put too much weight on Prof Wadham's forecast.

For the good of the public, there are some things that they just can't see because they're too irrational and stupid to process or contextualize them.\n\nI don't understand how the revelation of everyday communication within a presidential campaign is \"interfering\" in a presidential election. Why are they saying things that would be so offensive to the people whose votes they're trying to win? Are they lying to those voters? Do they think little of them?\n\nAs close Hillary confidante Eric Schmidt once said, \"If you're doing something you don't want others to know about, maybe you shouldn't be doing it.\""], [1, "I'm just going to point out that Wikileaks is mostly likely to be predominantly \"western\" organization - some of their identified staff are an Australian, an Icelander, and a Brit.

There are several reasons for the lack of Russian leaks, it seems like an appeal to ignorance to assume they're controlled by them simply because they haven't directly damaged them much yet.\n\nI'd agree that them saying that they have a huge leak on Russia in 2010 and then not publishing it is cause for concern, but to assume that means they're directly controlled by them seems like a huge leap. It seems more likely that they were enticed or threatened out of it. In combination with the possibility that the leaks would likely have very little effect since they were coming from a western organisation, it doesn't seem unlikely that they accepted Russian aid for security reasons (since the U.S. was actively exerting global pressure for arrest and deportation of Assange to face trial for espionage) and hope for a larger platform in exchange for not releasing material they deemed insufficient to begin with. Remember that Assange said:\n\n> \"We have [compromising materials] about Russia, about your government and businessmen,\" Mr. Assange told the pro-government daily Izvestia. \"**But not as much as we'd like(...)**\"\n\nSuggesting the material might not have been proof of anything, just indication of the occurrence of widespread corruption (which has been publicly known for a long time in Russia).\n\nWikileaks is a English-speaking western publisher for whistleblowers/inside information, so it's natural that they have a lot more access and appeal to western whistleblowers. You don't see much leaks about Japan or SE Asia from wikileaks either; it doesn't seem to be a strong enough basis to claim they're controlled by them either.\n\nI do agree that their interests have probably aligned closer with Russia than the U.S. after the U.S. began efforts to prosecute him for espionage after the publication of the war logs and all the other Manning material; but I think it seems more likely that the Russian connection to them was more in the nature of opportunistic support, rather then concentrated control.  \n\nPersonally I'd be very glad if the targeting of their publications was less strategic, but I think they've realized that mass-dumping information has a dampening effect on its' impact. A lot of their very valuable and damaging information has been met with a very weak public response in the U.S. particularly - due to uncooperative or hostile media, and seemingly due to a rejection of outside critique from the public. In addition to the U.S. pressure on their allies worldwide to arrest and have Assange deported, probably to face a life-time in prison/execution, with maybe some black-site torture on the way there, I think it's obvious they've chosen to concentrate their resources on what they perceive as the largest threat to public freedoms and information in the West, as well as the largest threat to their continued existence; namely the U.S."], [-2, "Am I the only person here who is surprised that people still don't know this?"], [0, "[removed]"], [-2, "[removed]"], [-2, "Can you honestly beleive that he could stay unbiased when the US Secretary of state asked if they could drone strike him?    \n\nWikileaks has been a massive service to the country and we owe assange a debt of gratitude.

He has every right, both as a journalist and a person to use his platform to go after the people attacking him. If it's okay for the NYT and other papers to show total bias, it's okay for WL too.\n\nAt the end of the day, we all owe Julian (and Edward and Chelsea) a debt of gratitude for parting the veil and showing us the character of the people in charge, and what they're really up to. Even if WL sits on every story they don't like, all the things they release are real. Without them we wouldn't know just how fake HRC really is and how cheated Bernie really was in this election. We saw through WL the true face of the Dem party, and it was ugly.\n\nThat is a service for all of those who would consider whether to vote Dem or not.\n\nAt this point, given your profound beating at the polls, liberals should be entirely focused on the message and stop trying to crucify the messenger.

Seconding it. Liberal here, as well! I started my deep soul searching back in the early twentyteens, when Obama was signing orders to allow Americans to be killed without due process, among other things. Proud to say I didn't vote for him a second time, and definitely didn't vote for HRC. That's my personal bias out of the way.\n\nI just want to point out that the DNC had chosen to support Clinton before any other candidate had a chance to attempt a run. It was very biased from even before Bernie appeared. The DNC owed it to help Bernie, and instead in the WL emails from Podesta, we see they were saying things like they wanted to squash him, or beat him to a pulp, and get him out of the way for the chosen one, HRC.\n\n(Also, take a look at the downvotes on this discussion!! Isn't it strange that reasoned, Pro-truth posts are getting downvoted on a hub where you're supposed to upvote reasoned, deeply informed posts?? Smacks of a pro-HRC agenda...) \n\nPeople here are much too eager to dismiss what people throughout history have died to get a piece of: the truth. People should be praising Wikileaks for its ability to give us the truth without any bloodshed, violence, or cost. It's truly an amazing thing. Don't take it for granted.\n\nThat said, if you think Wikileaks is biased... Start your own org to spread the secrets of the Other you seek to debase. A lot of people want Wikileaks to start spreading info on all players in the American political game. Although, that desire is probably not honest, it seems they just want to try to dismiss Wikileaks for bias (Where were you guys calling for Wikileaks to spread American secrets when it released info on Russia in the past??). \n\nTruly, Wikileaks only puts out what it is given. Today they openly asked in the AMA for Trump leaks, like they have asked for in the past. \"So what, they could just hold onto what they have and release info for one side!\" \n\nHere's how you know they aren't lying when they say they have no Trump materials: CTR asked for Trump material during the election. Nothing came of that call for material. Do you really think if CTR had gotten anything, they wouldn't have run it up the flagpole on the (proven biased and controlled) media outlets? \n\nIt's safe to say the absence proves there is no material on Trump (CTR and the media certainly ran with muddy, presidentially-unrelated smears with no problem). That, or someone just hasn't gotten the Trump leaks because: A. He speaks his mind and lets his dirty thoughts out in public, B. He doesn't have a secret server with huge security flaws that let it get hacked. It certainly isn't C. No one is trying!\n\nSo in my opinion, it's safe to say the leaks aren't biased. There just isn't any material to leak on Trump, and as /u/the_straylight_run, the lack of dirt on Trump doesn't change that Clinton had enough dirt on her to bury her and her election efforts, entirely. \n\nPeople should be concerned with what's on the table. Anything less, asking for a different plate, concern trolling about why there isn't material on other people, is just trying to avoid the truth, again, in my opinion. \n\nThere's having \"scrutiny\" for Wikileaks, and then there's mass downvoting dissent and refusing the truth that you have in front of you.\n\nSidenote: /u/the_straylight_run, love Neuromancer!", "id": "d9vdx4u"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d9vtwuu"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d9vubcd"}, {"comment": "Trump had plenty of dirt out in the open, people just ignored it after a while.

Why would Russia a country that is still fighting the Cold War with us just with a smile want the best for America? They want the worse for America.

It seems more likely that they were enticed or threatened out of it. In combination with the possibility that the leaks would likely have very little effect since they were coming from a western organisation, it doesn't seem unlikely that they accepted Russian aid for security reasons (since the U.S. was actively exerting global pressure for arrest and deportation of Assange to face trial for espionage) and hope for a larger platform in exchange for not releasing material they deemed insufficient to begin with. Remember that Assange said:\n\n> \"We have [compromising materials] about Russia, about your government and businessmen,\" Mr. Assange told the pro-government daily Izvestia. \"**But not as much as we'd like(...)**\"\n\nSuggesting the material might not have been proof of anything, just indication of the occurrence of widespread corruption (which has been publicly known for a long time in Russia).\n\nWikileaks is a English-speaking western publisher for whistleblowers/inside information, so it's natural that they have a lot more access and appeal to western whistleblowers. You don't see much leaks about Japan or SE Asia from wikileaks either; it doesn't seem to be a strong enough basis to claim they're controlled by them either.\n\nI do agree that their interests have probably aligned closer with Russia than the U.S. after the U.S. began efforts to prosecute him for espionage after the publication of the war logs and all the other Manning material; but I think it seems more likely that the Russian connection to them was more in the nature of opportunistic support, rather then concentrated control.  \n\nPersonally I'd be very glad if the targeting of their publications was less strategic, but I think they've realized that mass-dumping information has a dampening effect on its' impact. A lot of their very valuable and damaging information has been met with a very weak public response in the U.S. particularly - due to uncooperative or hostile media, and seemingly due to a rejection of outside critique from the public. In addition to the U.S. pressure on their allies worldwide to arrest and have Assange deported, probably to face a life-time in prison/execution, with maybe some black-site torture on the way there, I think it's obvious they've chosen to concentrate their resources on what they perceive as the largest threat to public freedoms and information in the West, as well as the largest threat to their continued existence; namely the U.S.", "id": "d9w25ci"}], [{"comment": "Am I the only person here who is surprised that people still don't know this?", "id": "d9vfhb7"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d9vkxei"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d9vwl5u"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d9v9jt5"}], [{"comment": "Can you honestly beleive that he could stay unbiased when the US Secretary of state asked if they could drone strike him?    \n\nWikileaks has been a massive service to the country and we owe assange a debt of gratitude.

Now, such blatant tax avoidance does look bad for politicians in the West, and that's where we'll really see head roll in the short term.  The Prime Minister of Iceland had to resign so quickly because he lied about it or at least was very misleading in a recent interview (so a large part of this is *lying* rather tax avoidance), and also he sold his share in the company to his wife for for $1 exactly one day before a new law went into affect that he would have to declare it.

Buzz words aren't very useful.", "id": "d1r99to"}, {"comment": "I mean it in a very specific sense, though I've noticed it around reddit more recently, which is strange to me. It's been bouncing around political science for years.  Notice that I discuss crony capitalism in the \"non-democratic\" countries section, not the section about \"the West\".  I didn't even think of the way I see it sometimes on /r/politics or whatever because that's about the equivalent of calling every thing you don't like \"fascism\".   Here's [a quote from one of the Wikileaks cables](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08TUNIS679_a.html) about crony capitalism in Tunisia, just because Tunisia has been on my mind recently:\n\n>Seemingly half of the \nTunisian business community can claim a Ben Ali connection \nthrough marriage, and many of these relations are reported to \nhave made the most of their lineage.  Ben Ali's wife, Leila \nBen Ali, and her extended family -- the Trabelsis -- provoke \nthe greatest ire from Tunisians.  Along with the numerous \nallegations of Trabelsi corruption are often barbs about \ntheir lack of education, low social status, and conspicuous \nconsumption.  While some of the complaints about the Trabelsi \nclan seem to emanate from a disdain for their nouveau riche \ninclinations, Tunisians also argue that the Trabelsis strong \narm tactics and flagrant abuse of the system make them easy \nto hate.  Leila's brother Belhassen Trabelsi is the most \nnotorious family member and is rumored to have been involved \nin a wide-range of corrupt schemes from the recent Banque de \nTunisie board shakeup (Ref B) to property expropriation and \nextortion of bribes.  Leaving the question of their \nprogenitor aside, Belhassen Trabelsi's holdings are extensive \nand include an airline, several hotels, one of Tunisia's two \nprivate radio stations, car assembly plants, Ford \ndistribution, a real estate development company, and the list \ngoes on.  (See Ref K for a more extensive list of his \nholdings.)  Yet, Belhassen is only one of Leila's ten known \nsiblings, each with their own children.  Among this large \nextended family, Leila's brother Moncef and nephew Imed are \nalso particularly important economic actors. \n \n>The President is often given a pass, with many \nTunisians arguing that he is being used by the Trabelsi clan \nand is unaware of their shady dealings.  Roger Bismuth \n(protect), a strong supporter of the government and member of \nChamber of Advisors, told the Ambassador that the problem is \nnot Ben Ali, but \"the Family\" going too far and breaking the \nrules.  Nevertheless, it is hard to believe Ben Ali is not \naware, at least generally, of the growing corruption problem.\n\nAnd so forth.  That's what I'm talking about, I don't mean Hilary Clinton giving a lecture at Goldman Sachs or however people sometimes use it on Reddit.  It literally didn't occur that people sometimes talk like that, sorry for any confusion.\n\nThe way that companies were privatized in the Soviet Bloc, the connections between businessmen and politicians in China, etc., that's what I mean by \"crony capitalism\" and that's how it's long been used in political science.  A quick search suggests it may have originated after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In places with crony capitalism in the sense I'm thinking, there's often a common word for the kind of political connections needed to succeed in business: *guanxi* in China, *wasta* in the Arab world, etc.  We talk about \"social capital\", or \"connections\" or \"knowing the right people\", etc. but we have nothing that signifies that sort of reciprocal relationship.  \n\nIn the last little bit (perhaps only widely since Occupy Wall Street, or even more recently), I've noticed it's been applied to American politics, to implicate a broad, corrupt relationship between business elites and political elites, generally in the context of campaign finance reform, sometimes in the name of financial reform more generally.  I'm in favor of both types of reform, but to call either \"crony capitalism\" is dumb, or at least a gross extension of the original meaning of the term to a degree that makes the phrase essential meaningless.  Huh, looking into it, Paul Krugman, who I often like, was using the [term in America as early as 2002](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/15/opinion/crony-capitalism-usa.html) (during the Enron scandal).  But anyway, when I talk about \"crony capitalism\", I mean, the type of economic environment where the government can take over your business and sell it very cheaply to one of their allies (not at auction) in an arrangement that has no respect for the rule of law but has the aura of legality because, hey, it was the government and the police who did it.  Where the whole economic system has the outward appearance of a normal, free market capitalist system, but the internal functioning requires bribes, corruptions, and reciprocal relationship between.  Where if I have a company, I'm going to consider appointing the president's sister-in-law's nephew as a vice-president because it will help getting contracts.  It's not a buzzword, but rather (I think) a useful descriptor of how the economy actual works in much of the world, where there's the appearance of a free market, but extensive informal state control via personal connections and sweetheart deals just below the surface.", "id": "d1rbbic"}, {"comment": "When your post kept going and adding substance after substance, I should have known it was yodatsracist.", "id": "d1rjngt"}, {"comment": "If they're a multi-national corp it makes a lot of sense to set up an offshore company.

It not quite the whole story, in fact it's bordering on \"we have always been at war with ISIS\" revisionism.  \n\nHe completely jumped over the period of the period when they were a recipient of NATO funding & training. He doesn't mention their [US supply line of Libya-Turkey-Syria](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line). This is a *somewhat large* omission to say the least, in context to the question asked. I'll not go into the details, Hersh's article covers better than I could ever hope to. \n\nSo, did Obama \"found\" ISIS? No. But would they exist as-is today without NATO support and the situation we created in Syria? Not a chance. \n\nISIS represented an excellent opportunity for the west to kill two birds with one stone. Being largely the former Iraqi army, getting them *out* of Iraq was a major win, reflected in the reduced level of violence with Iraq during this period. At times we were even declaring Iraq a success from this. Having them then take on pro-Russia Assad was the cherry on top. But as always, play with fire & you get burned. They didn't do so well in Syria & turned back to Iraq, a far easier target. They were also welcome there in Sunni areas where the now Shia-dominated army were never welcome, hence why they didn't put up much of a fight for neighbourhoods they despised & had been essentially been oppressing. A few decades under Saddam created an environment of revenge for them against the Sunnis & by [banning Sunnis from any form of government representation or participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification) it was a guaranteed shitshow. One that was fully intended imho, but that's another debate.  \n\nI think the far more interesting question is \"When did ISIS exist in the western media?\". Back when Syria was kicking off the rebels were doing all sorts of nasty stuff, literally eating their victims hearts on Liveleak. Our news was desperately trying to avoid these stories & get public consensus for \"intervention\", with our propaganda channels like \"Syrian Observatory of Human Rights\" and \"Barada TV\" stepping over anything bad done by the rebels & presenting an entirely one-sided view. Unfortunately with this propaganda failing and the internet providing a glimpse to our new allies true nature, the volume of videos grew to the point that these \"moderate rebels\" were proven to be anything but. Public support for intervention fell to all-new levels. Worse still, they had started to attack western interests in Iraq & now were even becoming a threat to the oil supplies. \n\nSo the tact changed; instead of invading Syria to take on Assad we MUST take on ISIS, this grave new threat seen by the world. They were then re-badged as \"supreme evil\" (no longer \"moderate rebels\") and our propagandists kicked into action, publishing story after story about them under their new \"ISIL\" moniker, one creepily adopted by the entire western press literally overnight. All of a sudden they were everywhere, the switch being quite jarring to those few without the news-media memory of a goldfish. \n\nBut are we actually at war with ISIS? Sort-of. Like Russia, we bomb them when they threaten our goals but we grant them a free pass to operate against our own foes. Both sides are playing this pass the parcel game where they try to push the mess over the dividing line. It's all a bit fucked up really, particularly for those who once lived in the firing line.

[ISIS on the other hand is] notable for actually keeping, holding, and administering territory as a conventional (aspirant) state.\n\nSo I talk in one of the follow-up replies to the post about how one of the things that we analyze about these groups to distinguish them is their intent-- who they want to target and why.\n\nThe second metric to judge a group like this is their capability. The intersection of those two points-- a group's *intent* to target something and their *capability* to carry out the attack -- tells you something about the kind of threat that that group poses.\n\nI think in very general and provisional terms, what distinguishes a \"terrorist group\" from other kinds of militant groups is on the intent side, that is, their willingness to go after certain kinds of targets, notably civilian targets, and often by indiscriminate means.\n\nBut from a professional perspective, we often eschew using a term like \"terrorist group\" just because in practice the important thing is that they are militants-- non-state actors looking to use extrajudicial violence to carry out some kind of political or politically oriented objective-- not that they are terrorists. Given that militant groups, regardless of whether or not they directly go after civilians, quite often employ weapons like explosives or rockets that can have an indiscriminate effect, means that whether or not a group are technically \"terrorists\" or not, or whether a particular attack is a \"terror attack\" or not, doesn't necessarily matter all that much.\n\nWith all of that as a preface, I would say that the most important distinctions between IS and AQ are on the *capability* side of the ledger. Core AQ was never in a position to transition from a group that could direct cells of attackers internationally to actually being an *insurgency*. I think they wanted to do so, and their \"franchising\" of their brand to groups like AQI (which eventually became ISIS) or AQAP in Yemen, or al-Shabaab in Somalia was hit or miss in attempting to do so.\n\nBut it's clear from the reproaches of Zawahiri and others to the AQI leadership that they did not think that simply establishing an insurgency was sufficient to declaring a state. \n\nNow, they made that decision on strategic grounds, but I don't think, on historic grounds, that you can make that conclusion that an insurgency cannot act as a state. So, in Vietnam, for instance, to give an example that I'm familiar with but not an expert on, you had what the US at the time termed \"VietCong Infrastructure\" which basically operated as a fully-fledged parallel state in South Vietnam, with mayors and tax collectors and all that. That kind of model, that not only will we be *an* insurgent group in Iraq but that we will be *the* insurgent group in Iraq, I think is at least one distinguishing feature on the intent side for AQI. But only in Iraq were any of the al-Qaeda franchises ever really capable of doing so, and core AQ never even came close. They were only ever able to operate within their broader host organism, be that the Taliban in Afghanistan, the tribes in Yemen and so on.\n\nSo I think you can see the difference in approach between the groups almost from the outset in 2004, but I think ISIS' ability to have actually done it, to have managed this territory, is more a question of their higher degree of capability to do so within their strategic of objectives as a formerly insurgent group than of AQ's eventual intent or willingness to do the same thing. AQ just failed to do so.\n\n> ISIS looks to be on the retreat on essentially all fronts, what happens next?\n\nI think we can already see some of what comes next for IS. We have already seen statements from their leadership to the outside world to the effect that if you can't come to Syria, go to other IS territories like Libya, and if you can't go to those territories then carry out attacks wherever you are. While some of these attacks in the west (like the Paris/Bataclan attacks) were carried by operatives who have come *from* Syria, we're increasingly seeing attacks by individuals who have simply been inspired to carry out attacks where they are without ever necessarily being able to establish contact or command and control from the central group (although some cases are interestingly kind of borderline or mixed, [for instance I thought this news story was quite interesting](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-attacks-germany-saudi-idUSKCN10J0UB).) But in any event I think that trend will continue.\n\nOn the ground in Iraq and Syria we know, from previous losses of IS territory, that basically once they lose a city or location that that frees up a whole lot of fighters to use elsewhere. Their strategy, as I mentioned in the post, from the outset has been to attack central areas in order to give themselves breathing space on the periphery. So for example [there's enormous political pressure in Iraq in the aftermath of major suicide bombings in Baghdad to redeploy front line forces to secure Baghdad and the southern provinces.](http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/180520161) When that happens you end up with one suicide bomber forcing the redeployment of whole brigades and regiments, so it's an incredibly effective tactic and one that will continue.\n\nPerhaps most concerning to me is what will happen if and when the \"Manbij corridor\" from Turkey into Syria is closed. US and [French intelligence estimates are that something 500-1000 foreign fighters are still crossing from Turkey into Syria to fight for IS each month.](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/100-jihadists-entering-syria-from-turkey-each-week-report-.aspx?pageID=238&nID=101935&NewsCatID=352) Kurdish forces under the \"SDF\" label have recaptured the city of Manbij but the corridor itself is still open. Where do those fighters go and what do they do when they can no longer get into Syria? I'm very fearful for Turkey about what the answer to that might be. I'm also concerned that, given Turkey is surely just as aware of that possibility as I am, that the YPG/SDF closing of the Manbij corridor might be a strategic red line for Turkey's vital national security. Obviously that is on the speculative end of this, but it is something to watch closely.\n\nThe more open ended question is what happens if and when IS is defeated in Syria and Iraq entirely. Progress is slow, but what happens when Baghdadi is killed in a drone strike, when Mosul falls, when Raqqa falls and so on.\n\nIt's possible that these territories might well be pacified, but I do not see any slowdown of the international Jihadist ideology in our life time. 9/11 was carried before there was an Islamic State, and there will be future 9/11s and other large-scale attacks after the Islamic State is gone.", "id": "d6fxvq6"}, {"comment": "> The more open ended question is what happens if and when IS is defeated in Syria and Iraq entirely.

They're thinking \"Ok if we beat the bad guys this will end and we can go back to normal\" but the thing with jihadism/wahhabism/whatever you want to call it is the people are second to the ideology. Until we deal with the ideology, which [is a much bigger task](http://pastebin.com/ksCCw8c5), something is always going to grow to fill the vacuum.\n\nThat's why then-President Bush was warned that Iraq and Afghanistan were not conducive to establishing a stable democratic state without an absolutely herculean investment of manpower and material both in occupation and rebuilding. \n\nA lot of people think analogize the extremist-controlled parts of the middle east to Nazi Germany but personally I think inner city Chicago and Detroit are far better analogies. They're regions where people are so lacking in opportunities, education, and infrastructure and so crippled by generational poverty and other longrunning issues that they're the perfect breeding ground for predatory \"gangs\".\n\nDemocratic/Economic Peace Theory being what it is I think this is the new normal.

Many lack religious literacy and could . . . be regarded as religious novices.\u201d\n\nBut I think that's actually exactly the point of groups like this. By presenting themselves as kind of the ultimate and most puritanical form of Islam, and offering redemption for previous transgressions through Jihad and martyrdom, al-Qaeda, ISIS and other radical Jihadist groups have actually been really good at attracting these kinds of \"religious novices.\"\n\nISIS I think has taken it even a step beyond what was being described in 2008, in that they are perfectly happy to recruit or encourage attacks by people who are downright mentally unstable. Core AQ was, for the most part, more intellectual than that.\n\nMoreover, I think the whole reason for individuals like this would find an appeal in these groups is not because it matches their own religious impieties but rather the exact opposite. As Graeme Wood wrote in [his excellent piece for the Atlantic:](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\n\n> \"The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. *Very Islamic.* Yes, it has attracted psychopaths and adventure seekers, drawn largely from the disaffected populations of the Middle East and Europe.

", "id": "d6fxg4l"}, {"comment": "> was the impetus for the \"founding\" of ISIS the US invasion of Iraq?\n\nIt depends on what you mean. Zarqawi went to Iraq and then re-named his group AQI, which would then rename itself ISI and then ISIS-- all of that was because of and would not have been possible without the US invasion of Iraq (or at least, in the case of Zarqawi going there in 2001/2002, with the correct hunch that the US would be in Iraq soon).\n\nBut we can also equally imagine a situation in which that doesn't really matter. If the US had gone in and instantly enacted a COIN strategy before the insurgency took hold, then there might not have ever been any space for Zarqawi's group to ever take hold as a full-blown insurgency and been just yet another fringe al-Qaeda franchise like their attempt to branch into Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat's basically the position they were in when the US left Iraq. They were on the run, isolated, disorganized. US withdrawal, combined with the simultaneous outbreak of the Syrian revolution, created the space for this group to re-assert itself in a way that was impossible from 08-11.\n\nIt's only after that ISIS actually becomes \"ISIS\", the kind of group that is doing what we now see.\n\n> Also, is the idea that they were kicked out of Al-Quaeda somewhat accurate?\n\nEffectively, yes. I get into this in the post. Once AQI became ISI their connection was already rather ambiguous.

To the extent that IS ended up with US-supplied arms and funds they tended to get them by picking up what was left behind by the Iraqi army. There's an excellent article that's just come out about how western-supplied arms ended up in IS hands via the Syrian weapons market [here](http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/20160808/death-of-a-syrian-arms-salesman#full) that is quite good.\n\nIf what you mean is that \"ISIS\" is sort of some conglomeration of US backed groups that then took off their masks and said [\"Look at me, we're ISIS now\"](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nOAPQJvJ-4E/U_Aj37SPOHI/AAAAAAAAD-E/BTq64Nyo5Nc/s1600/10269443_733706139999237_688573683621056836_n.jpg) and it just blew up in the US' face, then no, that is clearly not the case. We knew about, had been hunting, and came within a hair's breadth of destroying AQI/ISI from 2008-2011, there were no illusions about what a Sunni Islamist insurgency in Syria would look like and partly for that reason there virtually was no US involvement in backing Syrian rebel groups for several years, at which point these kinds of concerns were at the forefront. That some groups that got US funding then turned hardline is undeniable, but they are a comparatively insignificant fraction of the jihadi movement in Syria, not least because there just wasn't enough money or weaponry involved for that level of blowback to even have been possible.\n\nTo the point about the role of outside groups in their funding, I think what is unique about IS is how much more money they have got in comparison with other extremist groups. Al-Qaeda certainly had plenty of international donors. They never had anything like this. The FT has done some excellent reporting on their funding, for example these articles (which if you click through from the google search you can access for free) [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=diverse+funding+and+strong+accounting+ft&oq=diverse+funding+and+strong+accounting+ft&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.4738j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=diverse+funding+and+strong+accounting+ft&oq=diverse+funding+and+strong+accounting+ft&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.4738j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=ft+isis+oil).

He doesn't mention their [US supply line of Libya-Turkey-Syria](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line). This is a *somewhat large* omission to say the least, in context to the question asked. I'll not go into the details, Hersh's article covers better than I could ever hope to. \n\nSo, did Obama \"found\" ISIS? No. But would they exist as-is today without NATO support and the situation we created in Syria? Not a chance. \n\nISIS represented an excellent opportunity for the west to kill two birds with one stone. Being largely the former Iraqi army, getting them *out* of Iraq was a major win, reflected in the reduced level of violence with Iraq during this period. At times we were even declaring Iraq a success from this. Having them then take on pro-Russia Assad was the cherry on top. But as always, play with fire & you get burned. They didn't do so well in Syria & turned back to Iraq, a far easier target. They were also welcome there in Sunni areas where the now Shia-dominated army were never welcome, hence why they didn't put up much of a fight for neighbourhoods they despised & had been essentially been oppressing. A few decades under Saddam created an environment of revenge for them against the Sunnis & by [banning Sunnis from any form of government representation or participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification) it was a guaranteed shitshow. One that was fully intended imho, but that's another debate.  \n\nI think the far more interesting question is \"When did ISIS exist in the western media?\". Back when Syria was kicking off the rebels were doing all sorts of nasty stuff, literally eating their victims hearts on Liveleak. Our news was desperately trying to avoid these stories & get public consensus for \"intervention\", with our propaganda channels like \"Syrian Observatory of Human Rights\" and \"Barada TV\" stepping over anything bad done by the rebels & presenting an entirely one-sided view. Unfortunately with this propaganda failing and the internet providing a glimpse to our new allies true nature, the volume of videos grew to the point that these \"moderate rebels\" were proven to be anything but. Public support for intervention fell to all-new levels. Worse still, they had started to attack western interests in Iraq & now were even becoming a threat to the oil supplies. \n\nSo the tact changed; instead of invading Syria to take on Assad we MUST take on ISIS, this grave new threat seen by the world. They were then re-badged as \"supreme evil\" (no longer \"moderate rebels\") and our propagandists kicked into action, publishing story after story about them under their new \"ISIL\" moniker, one creepily adopted by the entire western press literally overnight. All of a sudden they were everywhere, the switch being quite jarring to those few without the news-media memory of a goldfish. \n\nBut are we actually at war with ISIS? Sort-of. Like Russia, we bomb them when they threaten our goals but we grant them a free pass to operate against our own foes. Both sides are playing this pass the parcel game where they try to push the mess over the dividing line. It's all a bit fucked up really, particularly for those who once lived in the firing line.

I wouldn't say it was to \"cover for\", more vilify given the change of approach for the regime change. Every enemy needs a name, you can't fight something in the press without a name. \n\nThe radicals had been leading the actual Syrian rebel gains for quite some time at that point.

Poor effort.\n\nIf, on AskHistorians, I said such and such used to be a respected historian but their recent books have been consistently poorly sourced to the point that he had to switch presses because his old publishing house didn't find his stories credible and as such I no longer feel like I can trust their research, no one would bat an eyelid. The same is true of recent Seymour Hersch pieces. \n\nNo one is arguing against the greatness of his previous reporting, from the Vietnam era to the Iraq War he's blown open scandals, but his post-2013 reporting is well just unconfirmed. The first story of this era, which I think was the story alleging the chemical attack in Ghouta, Syria was done by the rebels not the regime, was offered first to the *New Yorker*, which had been Hersh's primary home for two decades, and then the *Washington Post*. Both declined to publish the story because they felt it wasn't sufficiently sourced or corroborated ([citation](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/08/seymour-hersh-syria-report_n_4409674.html)), with the WashPo specifically saying they didn't feel it was properly sourced. This has been the problem with all his recent articles, as /u/CptBuck points out. \n\nThe New Yorker helped break Abu Graib (Hersh's reporting) and the WashPo helped break a lot of the Snowden stuff. These are publications that do not shy away from well-founded criticisms of the US government. They did not find Hersh's case convincing. Neither does much of the rest of the media (here is a [Vox piece](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8584473/seymour-hersh-osama-bin-laden) and [another](http://www.vox.com/2015/12/21/10634002/seymour-hersh-syria-joint-chiefs)). Neither do I, to be honest. I can't think of any one in any outlet that I read and respect who has backed up any of these poorly sourced post-2013 stories that Hersh has published in the *London Review of Books*. It's striking. It's a little extreme to posit that /u/CptBuck is the patsy and Hersh is the truth teller. In reality, the more common opinion is that Hersh may be being taken for a ride (see the Vox articles, for example--I focus on post 2013 but others put the date earlier, more like 2006). \n\nThere's an old axiom that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\". Hersh has long provided both, but his recent work has made similarly extraordinary claims that rely on what seems to many people as rather thin evidence (that other journalists have been unable to confirm).  Hersh may prove to be right, who knows, but he hasn't been able to convince me, the US media whose believed him in the past, or even his own previous editors like David Remnick that he's actually on to something. \n\n>The only real evidence we have to go on, then, is Hersh's past record. And this is what his supporters have said in the past: Hersh was right on My Lai in 1969 and Abu Ghraib in 2004, so we should trust him now. But in those and other blockbuster reports, Hersh presented more than anonymous quotes from \"a former adviser.\" He presented physical proof: government documents, internal reports, photographs. We are given no such proof here.\n\n>It is difficult to trust this story solely on Hersh's record for another reason: His record over the past decade has been highly questionable. Since 2006, Hersh has reported a stream of increasingly spectacular and thinly source stories: that the US considered dropping nuclear bombs on Iran, that US special forces are secretly run by ancient Illuminati-style orders such as Opus Dei, that the US secretly trained Iranian terrorists in Nevada, that Syria's 2013 chemical weapons attacks were a \"false flag\" launched by Turkey, and so on.\n\n>None of these reports has ever been confirmed. That stands in stark and concerning contrast to My Lai and Abu Ghraib, which were quickly confirmed by numerous other reporters.\n\nAnd more than that, most of these stories seem to be at odds with what other journalists *do* feel confident about knowing (internal debates within the state department/joint chiefs) which makes many of them not just neutral but suspicious of this whole section of Hersh's career.

My Lai and Abu Ghraib were not readily admitted to either. The former took years to expose & if it were not for the photographic evidence of Abu Ghraib that too would be in question. \n\n> There's an old axiom that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\".\n\nI agree. The extraordinary claim here is that the CIA only supports moderates.

There's a lot in this post I disagree with - it ignores several  factors that I feel are important to understanding America. \n\n(1) America is diverse - in geography, population density, urban v. rural, and in cultures. European countries, even after substantial immigration via the EU, are significantly more homogeneous than the US.  It is not possible to discuss policing in the US separate from this diversity.\n\n(2) Germans apply a social pressure to one another that Americans simply don't. Social norms are more readily enforced. This is especially true outside of US suburbs :-)\n\n(3) In my experience, Germans often can't comprehend how empty the middle of the US really is. The idea that you can drive for hours down a straight road seeing no small villages, major cities, etc. - this is something that has to be experienced to be understood. These places aren't the wild west. However, remoteness requires a personal self-reliance that is quite different from the relationshp that, for example, east coast Americans have on social services (fire, police, etc.).

Rehabilitation of the offender is not part of the programme, which helps contribute to recidivism. After spending many years behind bars, little to no efforts have been made to ensure that they become contributing members to society. Instead, they are homeless, jobless, and only find welcome among those of similar circumstances.\n\nAnother part of the problem is that it seems the American justice sysgem is bent on not only punishing, but punishing severely. Years long sentences for minor crimes, three strikes laws that led to lifetime imprisonment for any three felonies, no matter how minor in nature.  Public urination can and has landed people on sex offender registries.  I presume that is because of USA attitudes that genitalia and breast are exclusively sexual organs. And of course, the political climate is such that politicians that remotely suggests reform can see their careers implode before their eyes.  Sex offenders can be tracked by the public, encouraging vigilante justice.

The up-side is that they can physically stop crimes from occurring or arrest criminals after the fact, but the downside is that they are human. They're not emotionless automatons, they feel fear, anger, and all the other emotions you do.

Words can't even begin to desc... ahem, anyway. \n\n>Plus, the rotary is rigged up incorrectly as it has no cooling source for the condenser and it's out in the open rather than in a fumehood.\n\nEh, you don't *need* a water source hooked up if you're not trying to drive off solvents. The cold glass alone inside the condenser is enough to condense solvents if you know what you're doing, such as heating a reaction mix. The rotary is the only source of heat that I spotted in the pics unless I missed something. But look at the other pic, it looks like he knows about the concept of condensation and can hook up the water hoses if he wants. \n\n>There's also a random overhead stirrer in the fumehood (box contraption on the right of the sticker in the fumehood). Random because it's used to stir large volumes of reactions that are too big to be sufficiently agitated using a magnetic stirrer bar, yet the owner of this lab is not kitted out for large scale. It's just sat in the hood rather than being put away. Shows they probably don't know what it is and it's there because it \"looks cool\". Again, highly suspicious. Even more scary is they'll attempt to perform large scale chemistry. Some more perspective, remember how 3 years full time makes you barely competent? I've met a lot of people who hold a PhD and several years experience in industry who are great Chemists, but can't work on large scale safely which goes to show how dangerous it can be.\n\nThis whole paragraph is garbage. You can use an over-head stirrer in place of a stir bar to mix small volumes, you just need the shaft and some fittings. Some of the PhDs in my lab prefer them over stir bars because they're more flexible in their usage (can run viscous solutions, can control speed easier, can run larger volumes). And we don't put them away. They're hanging there out of the way and they're set up for immediate use. Putting overhead stirrers away is stupid. They take up space and some leak oil when flipped. \n\n>Speaking of which, fumehoods are a lot like kitchen extractor fans - they can be installed in a really shitty fashion. Just because it's installed, doesn't mean it's actually working. That fumehood, if used to extract toxic fumes, doesn't come readily attached with a filter, it needs to be attached to a system which filters out the fumes. So, he'd just be pumping air out murdering birds and wildlife. On the topic of disposal, he's got nowhere to get rid of any solvents and byproducts he makes. This is also a massive environmental hazard.\n\nThe only good bit about this comment. Those fumes are (presumably) being directly ejected into the atmosphere, which is bad. I didn't see any dedicated hazardous waste cans, which is bad. I didn't see a separate wash sink, which is bad. No spark-free environment? Bad. No fire-suppression system? Bad. No shower nearby? Bad. This kiddie stuff is fine but once you get more serious then I have to be very, very concerned. All of that shit should absolutely not be in the air, in the ocean, or in landfills. Or your skin, or your eyes, or your lungs. All of the haz waste from my lab is picked up by a haz waste processing company. It's expensive but it must be done. What does this kid do with haz waste? Nothing. His dad probably takes it to his real lab for disposal.  \n\nAlso another reason why I think it's his dad's lab who works in a chem lab: absolutely no analytical equipment. You need at least a meltemp or something to figure out what the fuck you made. And don't get me started on how expensive analytical equipment can get. His dad probably shit-mixes at home and brings in a sample for analytical work.

But look at the other pic, it looks like he knows about the concept of condensation and can hook up the water hoses if he wants. \n\n>There's also a random overhead stirrer in the fumehood (box contraption on the right of the sticker in the fumehood). Random because it's used to stir large volumes of reactions that are too big to be sufficiently agitated using a magnetic stirrer bar, yet the owner of this lab is not kitted out for large scale. It's just sat in the hood rather than being put away. Shows they probably don't know what it is and it's there because it \"looks cool\". Again, highly suspicious. Even more scary is they'll attempt to perform large scale chemistry. Some more perspective, remember how 3 years full time makes you barely competent? I've met a lot of people who hold a PhD and several years experience in industry who are great Chemists, but can't work on large scale safely which goes to show how dangerous it can be.\n\nThis whole paragraph is garbage. You can use an over-head stirrer in place of a stir bar to mix small volumes, you just need the shaft and some fittings. Some of the PhDs in my lab prefer them over stir bars because they're more flexible in their usage (can run viscous solutions, can control speed easier, can run larger volumes). And we don't put them away. They're hanging there out of the way and they're set up for immediate use. Putting overhead stirrers away is stupid. They take up space and some leak oil when flipped. \n\n>Speaking of which, fumehoods are a lot like kitchen extractor fans - they can be installed in a really shitty fashion. Just because it's installed, doesn't mean it's actually working. That fumehood, if used to extract toxic fumes, doesn't come readily attached with a filter, it needs to be attached to a system which filters out the fumes. So, he'd just be pumping air out murdering birds and wildlife. On the topic of disposal, he's got nowhere to get rid of any solvents and byproducts he makes. This is also a massive environmental hazard.\n\nThe only good bit about this comment. Those fumes are (presumably) being directly ejected into the atmosphere, which is bad. I didn't see any dedicated hazardous waste cans, which is bad. I didn't see a separate wash sink, which is bad. No spark-free environment? Bad. No fire-suppression system? Bad. No shower nearby? Bad.

Nothing. His dad probably takes it to his real lab for disposal.  \n\nAlso another reason why I think it's his dad's lab who works in a chem lab: absolutely no analytical equipment. You need at least a meltemp or something to figure out what the fuck you made. And don't get me started on how expensive analytical equipment can get.

As somebody who did only have a Bachelors, I often wondered why companies wouldn't take anybody than less with a Masters and after working in an academic research group, the gulf in experience became very apparent.\n\nI still think it's unfair that people who are in Chemistry programs and want to do Synthesis don't have access to an integrated Masters program (For example, I did Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry.

It's also no surprise to see \"PhD minimum required\" for Synthesis vacancies.  \n\nSo, I stand by my point in saying that BSc's and MChem's after finishing their courses aren't as good at Synthetic Chemistry as people might imagine them to be for the reason that the exposure to practical Chemistry is probably one of the least across programs.  In a full time program at a \"decent\" University, I taught second year undergrads who had Synthesis labs twice a week for about a third of the academic year.  The rest were different kinds of labs.

Someone 3 years into a proper chemistry degree is not an unsafe incompetent monkey in the lab, synthesis or otherwise.

Competence, abso-fucking-lutely.  Will they be synthesising extremely complex molecules using state of the art techniques? No, of course not. Will they be regularly performing synthesis of compounds aimed at increasing their understanding and abilities with minimal supervision safely?

Some others misquoted his post history and it looks like some troll also screwed around the post and misattributed things to him.\n\nAnd then /r/chemistry stickied a post making fun of him while he tried to defend himself and give more proof it was him.\n\nHere's what I can tell you.\n\n* OP is in high school. Not college. (He did do an internship at a university, but he's not an undergrad.) And certainly not a middle-aged man. I can vouch for him personally.\n* The lab is his own. He's provided proof in the threads, and again, I can vouch for him personally.\n* He bought the fume hood from Boeing, there's an auction listing [here.](https://investmentrecovery.boeing.com/surplus/auctiondetail.aspx?auctionid=50044)\n* He's a _much_ better chemist than I am. Seriously, he's younger than I am and I've asked him for help with my own projects.", "id": "d0cy2c7"}, {"comment": "It really looked like the kid got the reddit run over. Glancing through the thread I couldn't even get into it, the comments were mean and kinda silly. And the actual post this bestof refers to kinda made me wonder if it was written by someone who hadn't been in a lab since college or was in college. Not trying to malign him, just that is just the attitude all the grad students I have dealt with had. \n\nIn production labs, not saying it is unsafe or anything, but a lot of the mechanical part of chemistry becomes entirely mundane and demystified. I've never thought a hood was anything special.

In fact, the opposite is true, **any** opinion uttered by Kim is the right one. He has to listen to exactly nobody. In fact, there is proof out there that this is why his uncle was killed. He acted like too much of a man-behind-the-curtain and Kim removed him for the slight. \n\nA whole bunch of North Korea's problems are the direct results of the fact that the Kims never had to listen to anyone. Even North Korean problems with food security are the result of truly crackpot theories that originated with the beliefs of the Kims. Ever hear about the [Nampo dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nampo_Dam)? A major North Korean public works program, purely dreamed up by the Kims, and a complete catastrophe. It was built in an effort to irrigate more land, because the Kims didn't understand agriculture all too well, it lead to a huge loss of North Korean arable land to the rising water levels.\n\nWhat he has to do is pamper the elite. Which is why he gives lavish gifts, and that the North Korean state is involved with everything from fake currency to drug smuggling. Furthermore, at different times in their career, the Kims have all played the three main power centers of North Korea against each other. Kim Il-Sung mainly used the KWP to upset the army, and the bureaucracy. Kim Jong-Il used the People's Army against the KWP, and the bureaucracy. Kim Jong-Un has mostly been using the bureaucracy, even slashing key positions within the army. \n\nIn fact, there are plenty of analysts that believe that the North Korean nuclear program is meant as a means to scare the world but also to sideline the army more than it is now. \n\n> It would be like if the CEO of a major corporation tried to cut executive salary and benefits, the board of directors probably wouldn't be okay with that.\n\nThat's a really bad comparison.
