What I didn't know; is that they continued with the Apollo missions, I honestly thought that Apollo 11 was the first and last...

(I looked stuff up afterwards, since I was curious).\n\nI sound like an ignorant douche when it comes to NASA's history; I honestly love them... I just lack knowledge of their history- in that regard I guess I've been ignorant... It's just that you rarely hear about anything besides Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong (and occasionally Buzz b/c he's still alive).\n\nIn middle school and high-school, I do remember seeing stuff on the Moon Landing in history textbooks, but we never covered it; even so, (from what I remember) the information was limited to Apollo 11. I'm currently in 12th grade, and the only time I remember being \"educated\" on NASA, was in either 3rd, 4th or 5th grade where our teacher showed us a video of them orbiting (and trying to land) on the moon. She said it was a big deal b/c they hadn't realized how rugged the terrain was?\n\nEven now, I'm astounded that NASA had been able to land people on the moon back then.. I mean, think about it: we landed people on the moon when TVs were in black and white,... when computers were room-sized... That seems bizarre to me. Also how the margin of error on a mission was so slim. \n\nI started loving NASA when a friend introduced me to the game \"Kerbal Space Program\". The Science and Physics into building and testing rockets is just awesome :D\n\nThe political aspect & the fact that our government funded so many missions is also quite astounding... When now, it's a huge deal on whether they'll fund NASA for a year...\n\nI can't wait to see a mission to Mars from NASA... Really hope the politics and money stay in support... \n\nAnother thing; the movie humanizes astronauts... They're regular people too. (Not some adult who's been training to become an astronaut since they've been born...)\n\nHonestly; watching the movie, made me sad that I couldn't go to space and walk on the moon too... It made me sad, that because of Politics- the vast unknown of space won't even be explored...most of what we'll ever get to see are pictures...

How many did you take.\n\nBilly: Oh, I'm just fucking around. I only took 1.\n\nMe: Few OK, that's not so bad.\n\nBilly: Just kidding, I took 4. \n\nMe: 4! Oh shit.\n\nBilly: Just kidding it was only 2, I figured I needed more to get the juices flowing because of how much blood I have.\n\nMe: Pretty sure that's not how it works. \n\nBilly: Really? Cuz then I took another 2.\n\nHe took 4. \n\nThen immediently got a call from one of his friends who was saying goodbye as he was deploying to go over seas.\n\nDude lost his shit after that.\n\nEver see a 300lb+ guy, tripping balls, crying with a mouth full of candy while sweating through all of his clothes?\n\nIt wasn't pretty. \n\nWe went to the park and had a blast.

There's just not many more directors out there who can compare with the work of Mel Brooks or Richard Pryor as their brand of comedy was pretty unique.    Also you don't have very many comedic actors these days that even remotely compare to the likes of Harvey Corman, Tim Conway, Gene Wilder, the guys from Monty Python, etc.   \n\nPlus the audience has changed a lot.

You had completely ridiculous movies like Men In Tights, Hot Shots, Airplane, Don't Be A Menace, Naked Gun,  Young Frankenstein, Monty Python, Scary Movie, Austin Powers etc.  that people loved.   I think one of the differences is that these movies had at least some production value.  Meaning a lot were actually pretty well done with some pretty smart jokes in them.   \n\nI think too one thing that killed the genre is that parody movies kept getting shittier through the years... You had movies like Police Academy or Scary Movie whose sequels got worse and worse, but they kept pumping them out anyway to cash in on the franchise.

(Example of importance of state rights: legal marijuana is gaining a foothold via medium to smaller size states where it never would if only the Fed ruled supreme)\n\n\nThat being said I would be open to reducing the # of states in a few places where the delineations are slight, artificial, and insignificant (for ex. its hard for me to imagine a situation where North Dakota votes differently than South Dakota on anything).

Slow down, reset, and go back through the code (it will seem like you're wasting time, but in the long run this will go much faster). Verify all of the assumptions you're making using your debugging tools.

Fucking bag of dickheads. I used to think that Breitbart/Fox/Inquisitor were all crazy conspiracy sources. But in the last few days I've started picking up my wikileaks/clinton news from the rando sites (after vetting the source email from wikileaks itself - usually the interpretations of those emails border on hyperbole). \n\nComing from a liberal this has to be one of the biggest biases in Western world media I've seen in my life. \n\nHere is the original email that the independent is referencing from wikileaks\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52046#efmABYACC\n\nIn it appears that some guy called Band in 2012 (quick googling reveals him to be a staffer) was getting salty at Chelsea (CVC) for openly talking about her own personal \"investigation\" into the Clinton foundation for monies received from the Clinton Global Initiative. He's pissed that she told some Bush staffers (Bush 43 kids?) about the \"investigation\" who went and told some Republic higher ups (i.e. not smart). Podesta (Band's boss?) basically agrees with Band regarding the situation even adding that Band is basically understating the gravity of the situation (\"you are perfecting your skills for understatement\"). Band replies adding that Chelsea's lack of discretion in combination with some ongoing \"investigation\" into her use of foundation money for the wedding and general lifestyle makes for \"not a good look\" too. \n\nWhat is the investigation? We don't know. Did it find that Chelsea used funds? We don't know. Is it reportable news? Yeah I think so. \n\nAnd then you have the only mainstream U.S. media source, the NYT, come out with their own article regarding this. And it's a load of shit. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/us/politics/bill-chelsea-clinton-foundation.html?_r=0\n\nIn it they contend that Chelsea's \"love and devotion\" showed how much she cared for her family that she started her own independent investigation into the foundation. It heavily implies that the Clinton aides (including our man Band) may have used the foundation which concerned Chelsea who \"only wanted to defend her father's legacy\". Then the NYT throws in some random email from Chelsea to Hillary regarding Benghazi in an attempt to paint her as an altruistic and thoughtful American citizen. It's perplexing why that quote was added into the article - it has nothing to do with the original Wikileaks email from Band to Podesta. But what's more pathetic is that the NYT could draw all these conclusions from that short email in a bid to defend Chelsea and Hillary. \n\nThey're all in the fucking pockets of the Clintons.

I feel fortunate that Austin's maintained a steady growth through the years.  That brings problems, but they're not the kind of completely unanswerable questions like \"how do we get people to stop moving away when we have no money and all of the jobs are leaving?\"\n\nThere's still a lot of vibrant culture in Austin; if you want to see what a completely sterile city looks like, just check out Dallas.  There's a place that doesn't really feel like it's about anything.  There are definitely pockets where Austin still really feels like it used to be.\n\nYou really have to go to South Austin for that and I don't mean the '04 / South Congress area, because that's been gentrified to hell for sure.  But, to be fair, that's always where the well-to-do hippies lived and that's like 3/4 of a hipster right there.  But if you go a little deeper south than that, like 78745, you'll find a lot more working class people in neighborhoods that aren't getting torn down by house flippers or condo developers.\n\nAnd not only that, but with a higher cost of living, you also tend to get a lot more higher paying jobs.

Mankirk was married and had a child, we called him to see if he was sleeping so we could get the raid going but as the phone was ringing our GM asks us \"wait does anyone know Mankirk's real name? I'm going to feel stupid calling and asking for Mankirk...\". We had no idea what his real name was, so when his wife answered the phone we had to do just that. Needless to say she had no clue, then he apparently had to ask her a series of questions to get her on board like \"does your husband spend a lot of time at the computer?\" And stuff before she would take him seriously enough to wake him up.

My memory could be off because I never use this stuff in my day-to-day life but here's how I remember it.\n\n> ....but I, to this day, cannot understand what the fuck that means.\n\nOne of the things I love about my teachers is how the tried to help us apply these kinds of abstract types of things.  Calculus based physics is awesome but only if you have a good foundation in the underlying math.\n\nSo what you described was the first derivative.  2x^2 = 4x \n\nFirst derivatives tell how how something is changing over time.\n\nThe power rule for first derivatives helps you figure that out right?  Take the exponent of 2 times the constant before the variable which is also 2, reduce the exponent by 1 and BOOM - you have the easy way to calculate first derivatives.\n\nWhat does it mean?  It depends on the context.  One of my favorites is how derivatives and anti-derivatives (integrals) move us from:  \nDistance -> Speed -> Acceleration -> Instantaneous Acceleration\n\nSo the first derivative tells us how the previous thing was changing over time.  So velocity tells us how distance is changing over time.  Acceleration tells us how velocity is changing over time, etc.  The anti-derivative goes the opposite way.\n\nSo if you velocity is represented by 2x^2 then your acceleration can be determined by 4x, I think.

It takes, like you say, finding yourself at complete rock bottom, to figure out a lot about oneself. I've been there, and I'm slowly making my way up to the new me. I also hated myself alot, and sometimes I hated myself for hating myself. It's a vicious and merciless circle in the mind, and I had a lot of suicidal thoughts, which is scary as hell.\n\nOne of the things that have helped me is what they call a loving-kindness meditation. They are sometimes focused on loving every \"bad\" aspect of yourself, meaning you start sending love and compassion to the sides you are used to hating. An example could be:\n\n* Start with visualizing a memory from when you were really happy, loving and at ease. Maybe not a memory from your time with your ex, but it might work as well. Be in this memory for a little while, and try your best to \"wake\" the feelings from the memory. No matter how much love you feel while you do this, go on to the next step.\n* Try to take this feeling with you to your next visualizations. Basically, you will visualize all your \"bad\" versions, and give these unconditional love.\n* Give it to the one that makes mistakes, to the one who hates others, hates yourself, to the one who is tires, stressed, frustrated, to the one who puts others above yourself. This can go on forever, just try to cover up all these aspects of yourself, and just give them love.\n*Also, visualize you meeting yourself outside on a walk, and hugging yourself. Does the trick for me. \n\nIt is very counter intuitive to send love to these aspects of yourself. Especially to the one that attacks your mind with all the self-hate and shame. You might think \"But if I love that side of me, won't I nourish it and make it even more dominant?\". No. It will make you more distanced to these thoughts, and you might realise that these thoughts don't define you. In time, if you do this as a daily routine, you might actually start loving yourself. \n\nI have not reached anywhere near the point of constantly being at ease and loving myself, but I believe I will get closer to it with time and practice. I hope it can help you as well.\n\nGood luck, stay strong!", "id": "d2u8qad"}, {"comment": "All the victims of torture completely agree.", "id": "d2tqzow"}, {"comment": "Some people get off on being tortured....", "id": "d2tratc"}, {"comment": "that's why they agree!", "id": "d2ttg5u"}, {"comment": "They're the ones that decided to get married", "id": "d2txnpo"}, {"comment": "My only ephiphany is that \"Happiness comes from within\".

Short of giving you his mugshot with the name written under it, it was pretty clear 'who' the killer was in the 7 hours they had to build this world up before introducing him properly. You see his last name pop up in almost every episode when Rust is investigating the 'sprawl' by episode 5. The whole episode before he's revealed centers on them learning about the killer's family so when the episode ends its clear who he is. I'm trying to remain as vague as possible so as not to give actual spoilers for anybody who hasn't seen it.\n\nThere was never going to be a Scooby Doo moment where Rust pulls off the Yellow King's crown to reveal Michelle Monahan was actually the killer. And in reality Rust realizes (with the audience if they didn't catch that during the reveal with Detectives Fuck and Suck) that he actually met him when he went to investigate Marie Fountenot's school so you kind of even have that moment. \n\nThe problem was that the killer was boring, not that he was sprung on us out of nowhere. He didn't live up to the hype that we had built up in our minds and that was the point. He was always just a loose end they needed to tie off for their own peace of mind so that they could feel like they gave justice to their original victim and all the people killed because they didn't catch him in 1995.

Without a smartphone who knows?\n\n>GPS/radio/knowledge of typical traffic patterns and trouble areas where you are traveling.\n\nA GPS with traffic updates subscriptions costs as much as a smartphone, works slower, with worse graphics, and does infinitely less.\n\n>Again, just do your research before going out.\n\nYes, that's what we all did in the 80s.  So we frequently wound up having to make unnecessary trips \"Oh man, I was just out there, if only I'd known there was an auto supply around the corner\".\n\n>Again, just do your research before going out.\n\n\"Hey guys, this is running longer than we expected.  Why don't you go out and grab some lunch while you wait?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I can't.  I didn't research the area before I left.\"\n\n\"Go anyway?\"\n\n\"Okay!\"  <---- get's food poisoning at a restaurant with 112 one-star yelp reviews.  If only he'd known.\n\n>Why do I need access to every document at all times?\n\n\"Hey guys, the police just arrested me because the gun I sold last year was used in a robbery.  Can you go into my desk and see if you can find the bill of sale, then fax it over?  Oh?  It'll take you a few hours?  No problem, I don't mind sitting in jail.\"\n\nor\n\n\"Officer, there seems to be a misunderstanding.  I sold that gun, and I can show you the bill of sale right here on my phone if you have a moment?\"\n\nWhy do you need access to documents at all?  Because they contain valuable information that you occasionally need.  And when better to have those documents than the moment you realize you need them?\n\nYou're out of town, and have a bad ear infection.  It isn't responding to the standard antibiotic.  You're in urgent care and they want to try a different drug. You remember you're allergic to SOMETHING that starts with an X or a Z, but it's been about 7 years, and you can't remember which.  You're regular Dr's office is closed today, and their emergency on-call person will take half an hour to call you back after you left a message, plus another half hour to an hour to get into the office and find your records.\n\nMeanwhile, if you had a smartphone, then you can look at the google keep note you left yourself that reads: \"Allergic to Xamathan\", or find the text to your mom: \"Hey, I think I'm allergic to Xamathan\", or find the google search you did that contains \"xamathan hives\".\n\n>Being able to exist in the world without relying on your phone at all times is a useful skill that too many people these days are losing.\n\nBeing able to hunt for food is also a useful skill that many people don't have.  But this is called progress.  We live in a world with technology and divisions of labor.   The skills you're talking about are obsolete in the modern world, and only become useful for moments at a time when due to unusual circumstances technology fails.\n\nIf you're refusing to buy a smartphone because the apocalypse might happen, and you don't want to be rusty when you are searching through the yellow pages looking for a plumber... then you have a very strange sense of reality.", "id": "d74uy89"}, {"comment": "They are also magical porn squares.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "da73rzx"}, {"comment": "This message is way too long for a bot.

Issues of longevity etc aside. Is that not the case?", "id": "da779bf"}, {"comment": "Sure it does. The high torque gives it a lot of power and ability to quickly take off and land. But we already have airports with landing strips where they have the space to take off and land so it's not really important. The important thing for a plane is the range it offers. Both Airbus' and Boeing's newest planes, the A350 and B787, are ultra-long range planes.\n\nThe killer is the weight of the batteries. A Tesla 85 kWh battery pack weighs [540 kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S#Battery). Even if that info is not 100% correct it still weighs at least 2-300 kg.  \nA car has a fuel tank of 60-80 liters which gives it higher range than a Tesla. The fuel tank full can weigh maybe 100 kg. So batteries are at least twice as heavy with less range. (Yes it's simplified)\n\nThe fuel capacity of an A380 is 323 546 liters. In batteries (with the very generous assumed weight of batteries to only be twice) that'd be 647 092 kg of batteries with less range still. This would painfully cut into the profit margin of the airline as they'd have less available weight to sell to passengers and others wanting to ship things on planes. Not to mention that the batteries would need replacing after a set amount of uses. So that's a new thing that would need service and cut further into the profit.\n\nWith hydrogen you operate in sort of the same way as today. You fill the tank and go. The hydrogen gets replaced every time and the \"charge\" time is the same as it used to be. Turnaround times can be as low as 45 minutes. For an A380 it can be 90 minutes. You don't get to charge to 100% in that time, but you can fill up a plane with fuel (or hydrogen) in that time.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I believe in battery technology as well. But it just can't fulfill the same role as gasoline does today. Hydrogen can. But battery tech will be useful for inner-city driving. But at the same time, why not just use Hydrogen when the bi-product is just water.

At those speeds, you simply cannot ensure nothing will go wrong.  Maybe if you could keep the hydrogen exclusively in its containment vessel, but because it needs to be utilized in a reaction it must leave that containment, meaning there will always be a way for a valve to stick or a tube to break.\n\nYes, we can mitigate the risks, but I prefer batteries for two reasons:\n\n1) They're already much safer, cheaper, and more widely available, and I believe we should focus our research and energy on them rather than splitting focus.\n\n2) You can turn any energy source into electricity, which can then charge a battery.  So we can still use Hydrogen in safe locations, then pump the power to charging stations.  Getting Hydrogen to power stations all around the world is much more challenging and again opens up risk in both creation, transport, and storage. ", "id": "da7vd2o"}, {"comment": "Batteries cannot replace fuel that releases co2. They're heavy and simply not fast enough to charge. I like the example of planes. Planes are extremely weight sensitive and every single kg you can remove is good for everyone involved. The 85 kWh battery pack Tesla offers weigh somewhere around 540 kg. A full fuel tank of 60 liters weigh maybe 100 kg. Scale that up to plane-size and you'll see it's completely impossible. Not just weight-wise but you'll need to charge up completely with a turnaround time as low as 90 minutes for an A380. With hydrogen you just fill up the same way as you did before.  \nImagine the batteries (and amount of lithium) it'll take to power a giant cargo ship from east-China to somewhere in Europe. \n\nGetting hydrogen to filling stations is trivial. We already do it with gas and diesel, but in the future the trucks delivering will run on hydrogen so the only bi-product of delivering is water. Also, with electrolysis filling stations can create hydrogen from solar power right then and there, or with wind power. Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. If we can power our planet with the most common element, and it's only bi-product is water it's completely genius.\n\nThere's a reason traditional car companies are investing more into hydrogen powered vehicles. The fuel is easily available and it fulfills the same role as gas and diesel cars today. Batteries fill a niche of city-driving and that's great but it's just a stopover.

Now get me off the teller line and give me a raise because I'll have a much more intensive job imo. \n\nAs it so happens at the end of the quarter we were also going over major changes in everyone's work responsibilities and we're all getting our titled changed. \n\nSo I go through the whole nine. I have an interview with my boss, about the position, basically what's expected of me *when* I take the position. I tell him how much of a bump I'm expecting or I flat won't take the position. \n\nNext I have an actual interview with the Area manager and the branch manager it goes great. \n\nAt this point I feel all the formalities have taken place. I'm just waiting on the offer and the pay. \n\nI honestly think my expectations for pay fueled what happened next. \n\nPrior to the title changes. There was one banker and one me. A person who was hybrid that handled overflow and did the banker's job when she was gone. And 2 tellers and a partime teller. And two managers. \n\n\nAfter the role changes. The banker is gone and there's me and the two tellers. One teller remains a teller. The other is lateraled to what I was transitioning into. A \"Universal Banker\". So now there would be a Universal Banker and the real banker me. But now management decides. There needs to be no full time banker and 2 Universal Bankers can take the brunt of the work. \n\nSo now I'm not going to be a banker. I'm going to stay in my role and do the banker's work and a tellers work and no title change no raise. \n\nNow during this time another role opened up for a lesser Universal role that didn't involve banker work. \n\nSo I demoted myself into that role. Cause fuck this place giving me more responsibilities and no pay raise. And I kept my salary. And the funny thing about it all is the recruiter who finalized my self demotion said. You won't take a pay decrease cause in fact you're already about where you should be for this role. So to me they were trying to pile more work on me knowing I was getting underpaid. Recruiter spilled the beans on that one. On top of that I was already getting paid more than everyone who worked there as the newest person in the branch sans managers. So now I've demoted myself and am still making more than everyone there except the managers.

This is not because everyone on Reddit is a misogynist, but rather it is hard for them to understand something they never experienced. Add on to that the perceived notion that men's issues are being ignored, and that some how invalidates any argument a feminist makes. Reddit is the first to point out when a woman is being sexist, or the double standards. That is because those are issues directly experienced by the majority, but issues like \"a man can't be raped\" or \"no support systems for men who are victims of domestic abuse\" ARE feminist issues. I do have to say though that the despite them being feminist issues it is rare to find an impartial feminist. A woman is more likely to ignore those issues for the same reason; they are not issues experienced by them, thus are deemed invalid and or less important. that type of thinking and behavior only creates a bigger divide and causes more problems. \n\n\nAnother issue being, when you hear about how people you identify with can exhibit negative traits it comes across as a personal arrack.

Recent studies have found that transgendered people have a distinctly different brain structure than cisgendered people of the same sex, indicating that there is an underlying biological basis for gender identity.\n\nIt's hard to say if there are transgendered animals because gender is mostly a social construct and we can't really ask a buck if it identifies as a doe and wants to have its antlers removed. So there might be transbucks and transdoes but all we can really say is what the *sex* of an animal is, not its gender. That said, there are a lot of animals that can switch their sex back and forth, so the idea of transman having gender reassignment surgery to change their female body into a male body isn't as unnatural as some might think.", "id": "d646l4h"}, {"comment": "Respect.

He now does it during the day at random times. Dad put out 2 more traps, but we've seen nothing. He also lays on other bed and stares at floor forever, like he sees it in the other bedroom.\n\n> It's more insane. He just sit's on the floor like a statue without moving for hours staring at the floor for it to appear. The bathroom scales were propped up in the corner and Che knocked them over & around dad said. Mouse must have gone in the corner behind the scales, lol. Che went crazy moving them\n\n> He was also on the prowl back and forth to the back sliding door corner...his other obsession.

We had a great relationship at times, but any real commitment was hard because of both our personalities. But because of our friendship & emotional connection, we had a tumultuous relationship. \n\nAfter we'd been apart for a while and both had new partners, I moved to a city 800 miles away. About a year later she inexplicably told me that she'd accepted a job offer in the same town, and that she'd like it if we could try to make things work. Both 22 or 23 at that time, we were both living very different lives & I specifically was having too much fun to make things serious. Hooked up some, but she rebuffed my tries at being friends and things got sour. For a few years, we didn't talk at all. \n\nUntil I was 28 & we were both going to our ten-year HS reunion, the same weekend as our mutual friend's wedding. So we went to both events together, had a blast. From then we talked on the phone a few times over the next few months. We'd been talking specifically about working together on opening a food truck. From everything I deduced on her side, we both felt comfortable in that platonic role. And we talked about it in detail, I thought it was unambiguous. But apparently what the fuck do I know?\n\nUntil she calls me and abruptly tells me that she's in love with me. We talk all night, and then the next night and basically every day for four months. In that time things get as serious as they've ever been between us. I've never had anyone say these things to me, profess love for me that way. And looking back, I na\u00efvely thought I loved her the same way. \n\nIn that time we end up renting an apartment together in the new town where we were planning on doing the food trick. She gets there a few weeks after me, and immediately things were wrong. \n\nShe was unbelievably distant, like a different person, and the only thing I could think was that she regretted such a big step, moving in together. She denied this, and claimed I was pushing her away. I suggest we take things easy, sleep in separate beds, & try to find a way to make it work. This is all in the first three weeks of moving in together. She brought 2 different guys home for hookups in that time we were 'trying to make it work,' but whatever. \n\nMonths later things have deteriorated because of both of us. I'll tell you it was her fault, she'd say the opposite. She moves out after 6 months of the worst living situation of my life. When that happened, I woke up to her loudly boxing up my most important kitchen appliances (I'm an aspiring chef) to take them. She won't answer my questions or respond, so I start unpacking my things. She starts hitting me, I put my hand out to stop her, she threatens to report me for sexual assault, and I call the cops. \n\nShe got arrested that night for domestic assault (she drew blood). I've not talked to her since then. That was March 2015. \n\nTldr EXES ARE EXES FOR A REASON", "id": "d1q58xf"}, {"comment": "Wow. Good on you for staying strong.

To quote the policy \n\n>You are welcome to take the time away that you would like, so long as your manager approves and you are getting your work done, achieving your goals, and ensuring (as much as possible) that your time away is covered by the rest of the team. We ask that the time you take be of a reasonable duration and does not cause undue stress to the rest of your team. Please be considerate of major project deadlines and your role in supporting or leading key projects when determining how long you will be away from work. \n\nSo as long as stuff is getting done, and it isn't going to screw over your team you're pretty much golden.\n\nWhich also kind of answers your third question. People don't abuse it because it would screw over their team, and if you do that a lot you're not going to be around long. I mean really, what's the point of having the job if you're just going to abuse the hell out of vacation and be gone all the time. It's kind of obvious to everyone what you're doing. \n\nAlong with that, the company does a damn good job weeding out undesirables in the hiring process and only taking the best. Getting hired here was one of the most rigorous hiring procedures I'd ever been through with 7 separate interviews on different things over the course of several weeks. They pretty much ensure that the only people that get to the end of the process are people who are hard workers, innovators, and all around great people to work with. They even tell you right in the interview process, they don't hire \"jerks\". I have yet to meet a single person here who is a slacker and would even think to abuse the policy in the first place.\n\nThe best part is, in the end it's one less thing to stress over. I don't have to worry if I'm going to run out of vacation days. I don't have to worry if me coming down with the flu for a few days is going to mean I can't travel to see the family over the holidays. I don't have to worry if I've slaved away enough to rack up enough vacation hours to take a breather for once. I just can, and it's downright beautiful. Working here has been the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I'm working harder than I ever have, and I feel WAY less stressed about things at work than I ever have. I actually enjoy coming in a seeing my coworkers. I enjoy getting up to go to work. It isn't a drudgery that I do just because I have to to live. \n\nI wish more jobs were like this for the sake of everyone else :( I have way too many friends who have never had a job that treated them like a person but they have to stick with what they've got or go for broke. The work environment here in the states is awful.", "id": "cyge3jw"}, {"comment": "My job is like that too. I travel a lot and have been there 18 years. I could never work anywhere else.

", "id": "cyggd75"}, {"comment": "Sure thing!\n\nI think a lot of the reason why policies like this don't get implemented more widely is because of the question \"What stops people from abusing it?\". Instead of focusing on positive things like how this can *benefit* the workforce, they instead focus on negative things like \"what are all the ways someone could fuck this up for us\". If all we ever worry about is how someone who is dick could take advantage of something, and form all our policies around keeping those dicks from doing so, the policy kind of ends up being a dick instead. \n\nWhat should be happening is that policies should be created by gauging their benefit to the company, to employee morale, to the work efficiency, and so on. Instead of worrying about if a dick can 'work the system', remove the dicks from the system. They don't deserve to reap the benefits of the position if they're going to act that way. They get fired. Everyone else will be happier for it.\n\nThe company I work for tries really hard to center everything it does on some core company values the founders put together. Keeping those in mind have kept our company as awesome as it has been.

Said it was unlimited, advertised it in their recruitment materials and in interviews, and they still tout it in interviews they do for industry publications, but then when I quit they claimed you actually had to earn each day of leave on a per month basis. I forget the ratio, something like working 1 month for every 2 days leave.\n\nI worked there 6 months, earned 12 days, took 19, and therefore owed 7 days of pay which they took out of my final salary. Only found out when I saw my pay slip.\n\nThing is, it's not an unusual situation. Any other company, pro-rata vacation allowance is normal and makes sense (you don't want someone working two months, taking two weeks leave, then buggering off). What left me salty is they described themselves exactly like yours, about treating staff responsibly and not counting days. But then they turned around and nickel and dimed me on my way out.\n\nThat said, I quit because they were a bunch of tunting cwats, so what should I expect?", "id": "cygp5hg"}, {"comment": "Most people who can do what OP is doing right now can't be trusted with unlimited vacation days.

The US Department of Defense awarded contracts as early as the 1960s for packet network systems, including the development of the ARPANET (which would become the first network to use the Internet Protocol). The World Wide Web (sometimes abbreviated \"www\" or \"W3\") is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by URIs, interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet using a web browser and (more recently) web-based applications. It has become known simply as \"the Web\".

A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.\n\nOn 4th of September 2016, Christian Bale switched of his computer - the gateway to the internet and it's memes - and began a short hiatus.

Based on the original story by J. G. Ballard, Bale played an English boy who is separated from his parents and subsequently finds himself lost in a Japanese internment camp during World War II.[5] In 2000, he garnered critical acclaim for his portrayal of serial killer Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. He is known for going to great lengths to portray characters in films, notably for the psychological thriller The Machinist (2004), where he lost 63 pounds (28.5 kg) to play the role of Trevor Reznik.[6]\n\nBale went on to receive greater commercial recognition for his performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). His portrayal of Dicky Eklund in the David O. Russell-directed biographical film The Fighter (2010), earned him critical acclaim and a number of awards, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He has since gained further acclaim as well as subsequent Academy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and Golden Globe nominations for his roles in Russell's American Hustle and Adam McKay's The Big Short.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1\tEarly life\n2\tCareer\n2.1\t1986\u20131998\n2.2\t1999\u20132001\n2.3\t2002\u20132004\n2.4\tThe Dark Knight trilogy\n2.5\t2006\u20132009\n2.5.1\tTerminator Salvation incident\n2.6\t2010\u2013present\n3\tPersonal life\n4\tIn the media\n5\tFilmography\n6\tSee also\n7\tReferences\n8\tExternal links\nEarly life[edit]\nBale was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, the son of Jenny (n\u00e9e James), a circus performer, and David Bale, an entrepreneur, commercial pilot and talent manager.[7][8][9] Bale has three sisters.[10] His mother is English and his father was born in South Africa, to English parents; Bale has remarked, \"I was born in Wales but I'm not Welsh \u2013 I'm English\".[4] He spent his childhood in Wales, Surrey and Dorset in England, and Portugal.[11][12] Bale acknowledged that the frequent relocation had a major influence on his career choice.[13] He attended Bournemouth School, but left at age 16.[14]\n\nHis first acting role was a commercial for the fabric softener Lenor in 1982. A year later, he appeared in a Pac-Man cereal commercial playing a child rock star. In 1984, he made his stage debut in The Nerd on London's West End with Rowan Atkinson.[15] Bale's parents divorced in 1991, and while his mother and sister Sharon stayed in Bournemouth, he moved with his father to Los Angeles, California at age seventeen.[16]\n\nCareer[edit]\n1986\u20131998[edit]\nBlack and white photograph of Christian Bale\nA 14-year-old Bale in Stockholm, Sweden in February 1988 while promoting Empire of the Sun\nBale made his film debut as Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia in the made for television film Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna in 1986,[17] which was followed by leading roles in the miniseries Heart of the Country and the fantasy adventure Mio in the Land of Faraway, in which he appeared with Christopher Lee and Nick Pickard. His performance as Jim Graham in Empire of the Sun (1987) earned him widespread critical praise and the first ever \"Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor\" award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.[18] The attention the press and his schoolmates lavished upon him after this took a toll on Bale, and he contemplated giving up acting until Kenneth Branagh approached him and persuaded him to appear in Henry V in 1989.[18] In 1990, he played the role of Jim Hawkins opposite Charlton Heston (as Long John Silver) in Treasure Island, an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic book.\n\nBale starred in the musical films Newsies and Swing Kids, the latter about teenagers who secretly listened to forbidden jazz during the rise of Nazi Germany.[19] Bale was recommended by actress Winona Ryder to star in Gillian Armstrong's 1994 film Little Women.[18] Bale also voiced Thomas, a young compatriot of Captain John Smith, in Disney's Pocahontas (1995) and in 1997 played Arthur Stuart in Velvet Goldmine, Todd Haynes' tribute to glam rock.[19] In 1999, Bale contributed to an all-star cast, including Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci, and Rupert Everett, portraying Demetrius in an updated version of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.[19]\n\n1999\u20132001[edit]\nIn 1999, Bale played serial killer Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, director Mary Harron's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel. Bale was briefly dropped from the project in favour of Leonardo DiCaprio, but DiCaprio eventually dropped out to star in The Beach, and Bale was cast once again. He researched his character by studying the novel and prepared himself physically for the role by spending months tanning and exercising in order to achieve the \"Olympian physique\" of the character as described in the original novel.[20] He went so far as to distance himself from the cast and crew to maintain the darker side of Bateman's character. American Psycho premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival to much controversy. Roger Ebert condemned the film at first, calling it pornography[21] and \"the most loathed film at Sundance,\"[22] but gave it a favourable review, writing that Harron had \"transformed a novel about bloodlust into a film about men's vanity.\" Of Bale's performance, he wrote, \"Christian Bale is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor.\"[23]\n\nOn 14 April 2000, Lions Gate Films released American Psycho in cinemas. Bale was later approached to make a cameo appearance in another Bret Easton Ellis adaptation, The Rules of Attraction, a film loosely connected to American Psycho, but he declined out of loyalty to Harron's vision of Bateman, which he felt could not be properly expressed by anyone else.[24] In 2000, he again played a wealthy murderer, this time in John Singleton's Shaft. Bale's first role after American Psycho was in the John Madden adaptation of the best-selling novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Bale played Mandras, a Greek fisherman who vied with Nicolas Cage's title character for the affections of Pelagia (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz). Captain Corelli's Mandolin was Bale's second time working with John Hurt, after All the Little Animals.\n\n2002\u20132004[edit]\nFrom 2002 to 2003, Bale starred in three feature films, such as Laurel Canyon (2002), which was generally well received by critics.[25] This film marked the second time he worked with actress Kate Beckinsale, his co-star in Prince of Jutland (1994). Critics generally focused on star Frances McDormand's performance over the rest of the cast, however.[26] The post-apocalyptic action fantasy film Reign of Fire was Bale's first action vehicle, and had compared to all his previous work, an immense budget estimated at US$95,000,000.[27] Bale entered into negotiations about starring in the film with reservations, but director Rob Bowman convinced him to take the lead role.[28] Bale played Quinn Abercromby with Matthew McConaughey's Denton Van Zan. They trained for their respective roles by boxing and working out.[28]\n\nEquilibrium was Bale's third film of 2002, costing US$20 million to produce but earning just over US$5 million worldwide.[29] In Equilibrium, Bale played John Preston, an elite law enforcer in a dystopian society. Equilibrium featured a fictional martial art called Gun Kata that combined gunfighting with hand-to-hand combat. According to moviebodycounts.com, the character of John Preston has the third most on-screen kills in a single movie ever with 118, exactly half of the movie's total of 236.[30]\n\nAfter a year's hiatus, Bale returned in 2004 to play Trevor Reznik, the title character in the psychological thriller The Machinist. Bale gained attention for his devotion to the role and for the lengths to which he went to achieve Reznik's emaciated, skeletal appearance. He went without proper rest for prolonged periods, and placed himself on a crash diet of generally coffee and apples,[31] which reduced his weight by 63 pounds (4 st 7 lb or 28.6 kg) in a matter of months.[32] By the end of filming Bale weighed only 121 pounds (8 st 9 lb or 55 kg),[31] a transformation he described as \"very calming mentally\"[33] which drew comparisons to Robert De Niro's alternate weight-gaining regimen for his role as Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film Raging Bull.[34] Bale claimed that he had not worked for a period of time before he was cast in the film: \"[I] just hadn't found scripts that I'd really been interested in. So I was really dying for something to arrive. Then when this one did, I just didn't want to put it down. I finished it and, upon the kind of revelation that you get at the end, I immediately wanted to go back and re-visit it, to take a look at what clues I could have gotten throughout\".[35] The Machinist was a low-budget production, costing roughly US$5 million to produce, and was given only a limited US release. It was well received, with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 77% of the critics' reviews tallied were positive.[36]\n\n\nPart 2: The Dark Knight Trilogy\n\n", "id": "d7cpik2"}, {"comment": "Oh, NOW I get it!

"], [49, "Last night I was driving home from a party. I'd had two drinks right at the beginning and then nothing but water for a few hours - in other words, I was completely safe to drive. But in case I'd decided to get drunk and cab home I'd brought a flask of whiskey, which was in my left inside jacket pocket. I had my wallet in my right inside jacket pocket, and there were a couple of glowsticks on the passenger seat that I'd been wearing at the party. \n\nAnyway. I'm driving home and I see red & blue lights up ahead, and what looks like an ambulance blocking the three rightmost lanes. Shoot, I thought, someone must have gotten in an accident. So I get over to the left - but as I'm approaching I think, hmm, that ambulance doesn't have any flashing lights on top - \n\nOh. It's not an ambulance. It's a drunk driving checkstop. And I have glowsticks on the passenger seat, meaning I probably just came from a party, and I have four ounces of Spiced White Owl whiskey sitting pretty in my pocket. (As a sidenote, I highly recommend Spiced White Owl. Just not in your pocket when the police are making sure you're not driving drunk.) \n\nSo I pull into the checkstop and roll down my window, reasonably sure I don't smell of alcohol but sweating all the same.\n\n\"License and registration, please,\" the officer says levelly.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I respond, maintaining my composure. \n\nI very nearly reach into my left inside jacket pocket.\n\n*Recall, NobilisUltima,* my brain whispers, *that despite the fact that you usually keep your wallet in your left inside jacket pocket, at present it instead contains a hand grenade that will explode and tear to shreds the lovely night you just had at that party if this police officer sees it. Try the right.*\n\nI retrieve my wallet from my *right* jacket pocket, get my license, and open the glove box to find my registration. I pull a couple of things out - my owner's manual, an envelope whose contents I don't remember - a brief flash of panic bolts through me as I frantically try to think of any time I actually confirmed that my registration was in my car. *OhmyGodwherethefuckisit* - found it. Phew. The ink of my VIN is a little smudged, I anxiously note, I hope that's not some kind of violation. The registration is in a plastic cover, which I remove as I hand both documents to the officer. He walks around the back of the car to check them and I roll up my window. \n\nIt's worth noting that I've never gone through a checkstop before. I have no idea what standard operating procedure is - do they ask you to step out of the car? Would they need a warrant to ask to see the contents of my pockets? What if - before I can continue to work myself into a panic, the officer returns and tells me to pull into the rightmost lane, and have a good night. \n\nI put my license back in my wallet and my registration back in the glove box, forgoing the cover for the sake of speed. I thank the officer and do as he says, not daring to break my poker face until I break down in pent-up, hysterically nervous laughter several blocks away. Good *Lord*. That could have been about the worst night of my life - again, not that I was actually under the influence in any way, but the whiskey would have been hard to explain and I still wouldn't have quite blown a zero on a breathalyzer. But all's well that ends well, I think, as I pull into the parking spot behind my house. \n\nOh, I should put my registration away. I pop the glove box and take out my registration - wait, why does it say 2012? Frigid fear floods through me - am I going to get a ticket in the mail? Surely the officer would have mentioned something - but then I spot a similar-looking paper still sitting in the glove box. Odd, I think, and pull it out - wait, there are another two underneath it?\n\nIt is at this point that I realize that I have **four registrations in my glove box, three of which are not only expired, but are** ***not even for my vehicle.*** I have **three** old registrations for my old '98 Civic and only one for my current car. *Why do I still have those?! What purpose could they possibly serve?!* I'm pretty much a model driver, I never go more than five over the speed limit and I signal religiously, so I don't anticipate being pulled over, but *why would I keep those?!*\n\nI look closely and realized that the one with the smudged VIN is, in fact, my correct, valid, up-to-date registration. Holy fuck. I had a one-in-*four* chance of giving the police the correct documentation, without which who knows if they might have discovered the alcohol I had on my person. So basically I had the same reaction as OP when the officer let me go, without even knowing just how close to a ticket I was.\n\n**TL;DR:** went through a drunk driving checkstop, visibly coming from a party, with a flask of whiskey in my pocket and a 25% chance of giving the cop an invalid registration.

I'd had two drinks right at the beginning and then nothing but water for a few hours - in other words, I was completely safe to drive. But in case I'd decided to get drunk and cab home I'd brought a flask of whiskey, which was in my left inside jacket pocket. I had my wallet in my right inside jacket pocket, and there were a couple of glowsticks on the passenger seat that I'd been wearing at the party. \n\nAnyway. I'm driving home and I see red & blue lights up ahead, and what looks like an ambulance blocking the three rightmost lanes. Shoot, I thought, someone must have gotten in an accident. So I get over to the left - but as I'm approaching I think, hmm, that ambulance doesn't have any flashing lights on top - \n\nOh. It's not an ambulance. It's a drunk driving checkstop. And I have glowsticks on the passenger seat, meaning I probably just came from a party, and I have four ounces of Spiced White Owl whiskey sitting pretty in my pocket. (As a sidenote, I highly recommend Spiced White Owl. Just not in your pocket when the police are making sure you're not driving drunk.) \n\nSo I pull into the checkstop and roll down my window, reasonably sure I don't smell of alcohol but sweating all the same.\n\n\"License and registration, please,\" the officer says levelly.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I respond, maintaining my composure. \n\nI very nearly reach into my left inside jacket pocket.\n\n*Recall, NobilisUltima,* my brain whispers, *that despite the fact that you usually keep your wallet in your left inside jacket pocket, at present it instead contains a hand grenade that will explode and tear to shreds the lovely night you just had at that party if this police officer sees it. Try the right.*\n\nI retrieve my wallet from my *right* jacket pocket, get my license, and open the glove box to find my registration. I pull a couple of things out - my owner's manual, an envelope whose contents I don't remember - a brief flash of panic bolts through me as I frantically try to think of any time I actually confirmed that my registration was in my car. *OhmyGodwherethefuckisit* - found it. Phew. The ink of my VIN is a little smudged, I anxiously note, I hope that's not some kind of violation. The registration is in a plastic cover, which I remove as I hand both documents to the officer. He walks around the back of the car to check them and I roll up my window. \n\nIt's worth noting that I've never gone through a checkstop before. I have no idea what standard operating procedure is - do they ask you to step out of the car? Would they need a warrant to ask to see the contents of my pockets? What if - before I can continue to work myself into a panic, the officer returns and tells me to pull into the rightmost lane, and have a good night. \n\nI put my license back in my wallet and my registration back in the glove box, forgoing the cover for the sake of speed. I thank the officer and do as he says, not daring to break my poker face until I break down in pent-up, hysterically nervous laughter several blocks away. Good *Lord*. That could have been about the worst night of my life - again, not that I was actually under the influence in any way, but the whiskey would have been hard to explain and I still wouldn't have quite blown a zero on a breathalyzer. But all's well that ends well, I think, as I pull into the parking spot behind my house. \n\nOh, I should put my registration away. I pop the glove box and take out my registration - wait, why does it say 2012? Frigid fear floods through me - am I going to get a ticket in the mail? Surely the officer would have mentioned something - but then I spot a similar-looking paper still sitting in the glove box. Odd, I think, and pull it out - wait, there are another two underneath it?\n\nIt is at this point that I realize that I have **four registrations in my glove box, three of which are not only expired, but are** ***not even for my vehicle.*** I have **three** old registrations for my old '98 Civic and only one for my current car. *Why do I still have those?! What purpose could they possibly serve?!* I'm pretty much a model driver, I never go more than five over the speed limit and I signal religiously, so I don't anticipate being pulled over, but *why would I keep those?!*\n\nI look closely and realized that the one with the smudged VIN is, in fact, my correct, valid, up-to-date registration. Holy fuck. I had a one-in-*four* chance of giving the police the correct documentation, without which who knows if they might have discovered the alcohol I had on my person. So basically I had the same reaction as OP when the officer let me go, without even knowing just how close to a ticket I was.\n\n**TL;DR:** went through a drunk driving checkstop, visibly coming from a party, with a flask of whiskey in my pocket and a 25% chance of giving the cop an invalid registration.

The vast majority of them are there to have fun and have a good time.

I've watched the parks change in the last eight years I've been there and I've heard from many of the much older cast members. The Disney idea that I try to maintain is that my job is to make sure the guest is happy. If I make a mistake, if ANYONE at Disney makes a mistake, I just apologize and do what I can to fix it. I try to give the guests the best experience. I work with management that is too focused on trying to get the biggest profit they can. Management that when something is wrong will say \"that's just how it is\" instead of creating a solution or make the guest feel like they aren't being listened to or have to fight for what they want (and IMO they aren't expecting anything outrageous.)\n\nIt always amuses me when someone asks how it is to work there. I usually reply \"Its the Happiest Place on Earth.\" And if they press me a little more I tell them the pay isn't great, but thats not why I'm there. Truth is, most days I'm stressed out just walking into the place. It feels like a constant battle between what I believe is Disney level of service and the just-good-enough that my managers want me to give.\n\nOne day I was working in the Main St Mad Hatter and an elderly lady walked in. She was shopping for her granddaughter as her and her mother were watching Mr. Lincoln. This woman tells me about how her granddaughter was born with some illness and they were told she probably wouldn't make it to Five years old. She was Eight now and had gone through countless surgeries and they were at the parks to have a little fun before she went into another series of surgeries. They were worried that she might not even survive this round.\n\nWell, that isn't exactly the tale that makes Mickey happy. I want to do something for them. I can't just tell her \"That sucks, I'm sorry.\" As we're talking for a good twenty minutes I arrange for us to get her granddaughter a hat for free, doesn't matter what she wants. It's on us. We're settling on a tall [princess cone hat](http://www.yourwdwstore.net/assets/images/1/10000/8000/000/400005468216.jpg) when she talks to her daughter and learns that the next series of surgeries will leave the child in a head brace, unable to wear any hats.

The fact is social anxiety is a mental disorder, a malfunction in a person's brain. It can affect you physically, and on a daily basis. People like to say they have social anxiety if they're shy or something, but there are tons of people who have the actual mental illness. Telling someone to get over social anxiety is like telling a depressed person to cheer up.

I hope any struggling teenagers reading this realize that they don't have to succumb to social anxiety or feel like it's going to ruin their life.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "daps7m4"}, {"comment": "I'd have some anxiety if I was naked too", "id": "dap79cx"}, {"comment": "Welcome to the internet my boy", "id": "dap7dfb"}, {"comment": "Medication and therapy cost money.

And even though some competitors don't come back, there are plenty of returning athletes (along with their families, friends, etc) that I very distinctly remember from earlier games. Each time I see someone like these parents, who I remember SO vividly from the last Olympics, I feel this odd combination of surprise and delight, in addition to a certain level of familiarity. It's almost lIke bumping into an old friend that you haven't spoken to in years, but can immediately pick up where you left off. Every time I see someone like these parents, it draws me a little bit more into the Games and reminds me of all the amazing moments I've witnessed during past Olympics.

Applying the law of thermodynamics assumes, blatantly, that it wouldnt be able to.\n\nOK this one doesn't really make sense to me.\n\n> Secondly, the law of thermodynamics would mean everyone has the same basal metabolic rate. This is demonstrably not true.\n\nThis makes sense. Often, when people try to lose weight, they try to find a set number of calories for them to eat from a calculator. This number may be too high or low depending on the person. For some people, I guess maybe the number of calories required to lose weight may be too low. (this is just what I am trying to interpret. I do not actually believe this because if you are >200 pounds, no amount of calories to lose weight at a reasonable rate is too low).\n\n>third, it requires that the body be a perfectly efficient calorie burning machine. See above. Perfectly efficient and uniform.\nAlso demonstrably not true.\n\nHer argument could be that some people's bodies will try to store fat and, instead, make the person tired to compensate for the drop in calories. I do believe that losing weight is not the same difficulty for everyone. It may be more difficult for some to the point that it's very, very hard.\n\n>Fourthly, the law of thermodynamics would mean hormones and glucose have no bearing on weight gain or loss.

If I'm just playing with friends, I prefer the madness of items (is there anything more satisfying than home run batting your friend into space to end a match?). \n\nIf I want DURRRRR ALL ABOUT SKILL BRO DURRRR I'll play Street Fighter. Taking the items off in Smash is like playing Mario Kart without items because YOU SHOULD NEED TRUE DRIVING SKILL TO WIN BRO. ", "id": "dafkp9e"}, {"comment": "Melee is a more technical game than street fighter.\n\nCome at me.", "id": "dafn5bg"}, {"comment": "Items in Mario Kart can't really be compared to items smash.  Items in Mario Kart are a balancing/comeback mechanic, where you get better items as your placement drops.  You ever notice that you can never get a star or thunderbolt if you are in first place.  In smash, items spawn randomly with no regard to who is winning or not.  Items in smash are also way too OP, to the point where it over-centralizes the metagame.  It goes from a game that requires you to out think and out perform your opponent to win, to a game that is about camping and controlling items.  A high level player only needs to grab that one first item that randomly spawns in, and then he can use that one item to secure the next item that drops and so on. He now has a huge advantage over his opponent and will most likely win, unless he losses his control over the items.
