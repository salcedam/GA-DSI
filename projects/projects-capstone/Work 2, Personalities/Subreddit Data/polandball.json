He's speaking during all this video in South-Polish highlander local dialect (that's why he often says \"heeey!\") He says that he will sing a song as his grandfather did in 1939 during a party in Zakopane (Polish southern city, highlander folk centre). From 0:19 he sings a polish highlander song \"Hej bystra woda!\" (\"Hey! Swift waters!\"). From 0:32 he says that he will sing how he in 1995 had fun on disco. In this song he sings something about his brother-in-law, that he's not afraid of Siklawica (a waterfall in Southern Poland)  because he has 2 bullets to his rifle in his house. Then he sings that he's feeling great. From 1:17 he sings another highlander song \"Hej g\u00f3rol, ci ja g\u00f3rol!\" (\"Hey highlander! I'm your highlander!\"). From 1:28 Mr. Edzio dressed as a woman says that he will teach him (as a man) how to sing. Then he (as a woman) sings som weird shit that even I as a Pole can't understand shit. Something about playing drums, vodka, and bar fights... From 1:52 that cute lady sings something about her beloved Bodzio (aka Mr. Edzio). From 2:04 Mr. Edzio sings another highlander song \"W murowanej piwnicy\" (\"In brick basement [danced a highland robbers]\"). From 2:11 Mr. Edzio (as a woman) says that the cute lady's shoe's breaking (common Polish saying when we see a frocked up lady). Then another bullshit singing that it will be okay, ambulance is on the way and I can't understand the rest... Anyway, from 2:29 he shouts that everybody sing that together, and then they sing another highlander song \"G\u00f3ralu, czy ci nie \u017cal?\" (\"Highlander, don''t you regret?\"). Fron 2:44 is some kind of techno version of Mr. Edzio's song. Everything will be fine, everything will be great etc. It's a funny clip.

So it's the actual governing party which has close ties with groups that want to repudiate Japan's apologies in the past as well as restore things like Japan's right to wage war and modify the more liberal aspects of its constitution.\n\nEven though the actual leaders tend to be more moderate, they end up doing things like paying respects at the resting place of class A war criminals to placate their base.

Our other option was a full-scale land invasion, and the death toll projections from that-- on both sides-- would have been catastrophic, possibly genocidal. \n\nThis is a common statement about the dropping of the bombs that is completely incorrect. Simply put, the nukes were not perceived as being special until **after** they were dropped. \n\nThey were not part of some either/or where the choice was to nuke or to invade. They were not ordered by the president. They were not part of some special plan to intimidate the USSR. They didn't even cause Japan to surrender. \n\nThe dropping of the nuclear bombs were simply the next big bombing technology and a natural growth from fire bombing -- itself a relatively recent invention. This is one of the most important things to understand. No one dropping the bombs at the time thought there where anything more than the next step up: the iPhone 7 to fire bombing's iPhone 6s. They followed the same chain of orders and plans as the fire bombing. They were order by the same people (i.e., LeMay, et al). Yes, afterwards they did create a big shock and as a result there is as been a massive effort to revise history to explain them which is where you get the nuke or invade false dichotomy. There was no \"special purpose / plan / stratagem\" involved in dropping the nukes.\n\nThis also leads to a just silly underplaying of the USSR's role in the war against Japan. The way the USA teaches it the Japanese war was just \"the Pacific war\" ignoring all of Japan's huge land based empire in continental Asia that powered it's economy and ability to make war. Much of the hardest slog against Japan was in Manchuria and in China and those were mostly fought by the USSR; the CPC and KMT being to busy fighting each other to meaningfully resist Japan. This was Japan's most important holdings: where all the resources were that it needed to keep fighting. And this was guarded by Japan's most hardened veterans. And it was once the USSR had liberated the area and was posed to join the US in a two front invasion that Japan surrender. We have the records of the Japanese discussions leading up to the surrender -- it wasn't the nukes that drove it. They were afraid they would be partitioned between the USA and USSR like Germany  -- this was the driver behind the decision -- and so they chose what they felt was the lesser evil.  \n\nThis is not to downplay the USA's massive contribution in the war against Japan. And granted, of course, in both Europe and Asia, the USA did pay for a lot of the USSR's expenses. While the fight in Europe was won the backs of the USSR, the USA did the largest share of the fighting against Japan. But the fighting split against Japan was more 50% USA, 40% USSR, 10% others rather than the 90% USA that often is expressed by USA extreme nationalists.\n\nEdit...

Montenegro is sleeping. BiH is talking to itself and has severe case of split personalities.\n\nAlso it is just me or you just constantly say Serbia this, Serbia that. Reason why capital of communist Yugo was in Belgrade, not anywhere else is just because it was there during kingdom too. Not because of fascists. If we would give the capital to the people that had the most achievement during the resistance, capital would not be in Belgrade, but either in Zagreb or in Sarajevo (Serbs were really only numerous during the last years of fighting and during late 1943 Croats were the most numerous group in partisan movement).

For a young soldier with all of his service ahead, asking this question shows disrespect, and the right to ask, or rather say these words is reserved only for those who are at the end of their service. Israelis who travel abroad after the long time in the army usually spread this phrase among non-Hebrew speakers who just want to learn a couple of words in Hebrew to impress their friends. Anyway, I got to see a couple of people during my trip that \"\u05e2\u05d3 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\" was one of the few phrases they knew in Hebrew.\n\n* The second plate reads \"\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\" which doesn't correspond to a Hebrew word. My best guess is that he tried to write \"\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d0\u05e1\" (usually written \"\u05e0\u05de\u05d0\u05e1\") - meaning \"to be sick off\", which corresponds to \"\u05e2\u05d3 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\". I'm not sure what OP meant, but certainly what's there isn't a word nor a combination of words.\n* ~~On the Kippah itself it reads \"\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05d4...\" which looks like a part of a sentence.

For a young soldier with all of his service ahead, asking this question shows disrespect, and the right to ask, or rather say these words is reserved only for those who are at the end of their service. Israelis who travel abroad after the long time in the army usually spread this phrase among non-Hebrew speakers who just want to learn a couple of words in Hebrew to impress their friends. Anyway, I got to see a couple of people during my trip that \"\u05e2\u05d3 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\" was one of the few phrases they knew in Hebrew.\n\n* The second plate reads \"\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\" which doesn't correspond to a Hebrew word. My best guess is that he tried to write \"\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d0\u05e1\" (usually written \"\u05e0\u05de\u05d0\u05e1\") - meaning \"to be sick off\", which corresponds to \"\u05e2\u05d3 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\". I'm not sure what OP meant, but certainly what's there isn't a word nor a combination of words.\n* ~~On the Kippah itself it reads \"\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05d4...\" which looks like a part of a sentence.

Not sure what OP meant there either, but that's it.~~\n\n**Edit:** as /u/GangsterJawa pointed out, it does seem to correspond  a recent [\\(horrible\\) pop song](https://youtu.be/YJsi8g_Hsvo) that I've thankfully managed to avoid for the last six months.

The Xia was succeeded by the Shang, then by the Western Zhou. In the Eastern Zhou, imperial authority collapsed, and various states fractured into the Spring and Autumn, then Warring States. The Qin united China during the Warring States and founded the Qin Dynasty. It was succeeded by the Western Han dynasty, but then a brief Xin dynasty interrupted it, of which then the Eastern Han succeeded it. The Eastern Han would collapse into the Three Kingdoms: Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The three were united under Western Jin. Then, the barbarians invaded and founded the Sixteen Kingdoms: Former Liang, Later Liang, Northern Liang, Southern Liang, Western Liang, Former Yan, Later Yan, Northern Yan, Southern Yan, Former Qin, Later Qin, Western Qin, Former Zhao, Later Zhao, Cheng Han, and Xia. The remnants of the Jin became Eastern Jin. The sixteen kingdoms evolved into the Northern Dynasties, which were Northern Wei, which then broke into Western Wei and Eastern Wei, evolving into Northern Zhou and Northern Qi respectively. The Eastern Jin became the Liu Song, succeeded by the Liang, Southern Qi, and finally Chen. The Sui dynasty unified China, and was succeeded by the Tang. Toward the end, the Liao dynasty was founded by Khitans in the north, and in the souh, it broke into the Five Dynasties, Later Liang, Later Tang, Later Jin, Later Han, and Later Zhou, and the Ten Kingdoms, Wu, Wuyue, Min, Chu, Southern Han, Former Shu, Later Shu, Jingnan, Southern Tang, and Northern Han. The Northern Song dynasty would unite them all. In the north, the Liao was chased to the west to become the Western Liao, or Qara Khitai. The Jin and Western Xia took its place. The Jin also conquered the northern part of the Song, which then laid the basis for Southern Song. All four dynasties were conquered by the Mongols, who founded the Yuan dynasty. The Yuan was succeeded by the Han Chinese Ming, who in turn was succeeded by the Manchu Qing. The Qing was overthrown by the Tongmenghui, later Guomindang. The Guomindang founded the Republic of China, but the original Beiyang government was weak, and the country fell under warlords. The Beiyang was replaced by another Guomindang, who established the Nanjing government. They would have to fight the Imperial Japanese, and later the commies.

The Xia was succeeded by the Shang, then by the Western Zhou. In the Eastern Zhou, imperial authority collapsed, and various states fractured into the Spring and Autumn, then Warring States. The Qin united China during the Warring States and founded the Qin Dynasty. It was succeeded by the Western Han dynasty, but then a brief Xin dynasty interrupted it, of which then the Eastern Han succeeded it. The Eastern Han would collapse into the Three Kingdoms: Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The three were united under Western Jin. Then, the barbarians invaded and founded the Sixteen Kingdoms: Former Liang, Later Liang, Northern Liang, Southern Liang, Western Liang, Former Yan, Later Yan, Northern Yan, Southern Yan, Former Qin, Later Qin, Western Qin, Former Zhao, Later Zhao, Cheng Han, and Xia. The remnants of the Jin became Eastern Jin. The sixteen kingdoms evolved into the Northern Dynasties, which were Northern Wei, which then broke into Western Wei and Eastern Wei, evolving into Northern Zhou and Northern Qi respectively. The Eastern Jin became the Liu Song, succeeded by the Liang, Southern Qi, and finally Chen. The Sui dynasty unified China, and was succeeded by the Tang. Toward the end, the Liao dynasty was founded by Khitans in the north, and in the souh, it broke into the Five Dynasties, Later Liang, Later Tang, Later Jin, Later Han, and Later Zhou, and the Ten Kingdoms, Wu, Wuyue, Min, Chu, Southern Han, Former Shu, Later Shu, Jingnan, Southern Tang, and Northern Han. The Northern Song dynasty would unite them all. In the north, the Liao was chased to the west to become the Western Liao, or Qara Khitai. The Jin and Western Xia took its place. The Jin also conquered the northern part of the Song, which then laid the basis for Southern Song. All four dynasties were conquered by the Mongols, who founded the Yuan dynasty. The Yuan was succeeded by the Han Chinese Ming, who in turn was succeeded by the Manchu Qing. The Qing was overthrown by the Tongmenghui, later Guomindang. The Guomindang founded the Republic of China, but the original Beiyang government was weak, and the country fell under warlords. The Beiyang was replaced by another Guomindang, who established the Nanjing government. They would have to fight the Imperial Japanese, and later the commies. The commies won, and founded the People's Republic of China, which it remains to this day.\n", "id": "d9zektw"}, {"comment": "May I introduce you guys, to the Great Wall of Text about China", "id": "d9zzdk6"}, {"comment": "So that is the Great Wall of text you guys talked about last time.", "id": "da0isdr"}, {"comment": "Thats great and all but i think it'd probably just go back to the qing dynasty", "id": "d9zmftw"}, {"comment": "Or just go back to the Cultural Revolution with China stabbing himself repeatedly", "id": "da0ejfc"}, {"comment": "That was what I posted as a list of old Chinese states", "id": "d9zeqrc"}, {"comment": "That might all be very interesting, but ain't no body got time for this.", "id": "da7hqy5"}], [{"comment": "Its not Italy alast", "id": "d9ym96c"}], [{"comment": "Yep, now hit Italy twice, i want to see what happens.", "id": "d9ymwr6"}], [{"comment": "I was expecting a Senegal pun (although that sort of would have been a stretch).", "id": "d9yqijo"}], [{"comment": "Next panel is probably Prussia eating everything, including France.", "id": "d9zfltz"}], [{"comment": "Love the unrelated stats equations in the background.", "id": "d9z5ukv"}], [{"comment": "I don't see why none of them are panicking.

But in that case the eastern front casualty number you gave is too low. 8 million already accounts for killed and captured, injured adds another 5 million.\n\nYou should also be more careful how you present the data. The number of German soldiers who were captured on the western front is significantly larger than the number of German soldiers that fought in the western front. This has much to do with crushed eastern armies desperately trying to escape from the eastern theatre. Racing to surrender to the west was a matter of survival for many. I'm one of those weirdos who really does believe that [casualties reflect the intensity of the fighting.](http://wwiiprojectwebsite.weebly.com/uploads/2/7/8/6/27867227/1487847_orig.gif)\n\nAlso, be careful about implications regarding the effectiveness of Allied bombing of German industry in the broad sense. It's unknown how effective the Allied bombing campaign was, particularly since German industrial output not only continuously grew throughout the war, but accelerated up until the resource shortage caused by the loss of eastern territories. Germany didn't even transition into a war economy until the near end.\n\nThe German army did not withdraw out of Operation Zitadelle because of the Allied invasion of Italy. What happened was several German units were transferred out from the battle to head west weakening the German offensive, but the fighting kept going for weeks. Realistically, the Soviet reserves were so much larger than had been estimated that it's difficult to assess whether keeping those units in the east would have changed the outcome.", "id": "d0woukr"}, {"comment": "Thank you for the info, I was working off memory.

The Allies spent a significant amount of their war effort into conducting the bombing campaigns which were pushed through in large part for political and ideological purposes. Legitimising the bombing campaign was a constant issue in the face of widespread criticism that it was ineffective in addition to being inhumane, and they wanted to demonstrate that the campaign was not wasteful. The British even attempted to measure their efficiency as man-hours of German industry lost vs man-hours of British war industry for the bombers put in. Always consider the source and how a particular narrative would help or hinder it. \n\nMuch of the controversy ensued when economic historians post-war tried to estimate the efficacy of the Allied bombing campaign and were unable to make any determination whatsoever. Some economic historians even suggest that the campaign was negligible and made no meaningful impact on the war. The moderates took a position that the potential remained higher than the accomplished result. Even so, basically everyone was forced to admit that the wartime stated aim of using aerial bombing to force Germany into submission was an abject failure, in part because Allied assumptions about German operations were fundamentally wrong.\n\nSpeer agreed with the Allies that the Allied target selection methodology was largely correct, but went on to add that to exploit the opportunity they would have had to commit significantly more resources into bombing the targets repeatedly for a sustained period of time, which did not happen. Instead, the Germans were warned to the systemic weakness and were quickly able to disperse production and reorganise in such a way as to avoid the same exposure. You should also be careful using Speer as a source. He was a clever and suave individual who intimately understood how to maneuver himself politically, his profession of apoliticality helped his own personal interests in that regard, especially with the Americans. He was known to tell the Allies what they wanted to hear and sometimes would mask agreements designed to flatter in the form of a contradiction. \"Tell the idiots what they want to hear\" is a typical German mindset.", "id": "d0xstad"}, {"comment": "And the vast majority of those casualties comes from the early days of Barbarossa in which the Axis had surprise, numerical superiority, and not haing just purged their entire officer corps on their side.

Late war, thhhe RKKA and the Wehrmacht had roughly equal to pro-RKKA kill ratios, although that is ultimately irrelevant as the Red Army won despie it.

Finns drank *paloviina* or *viina*, which is comes from the Swedish word [br\u00e4nnvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A4nnvin). In 1932, what Alko sold wasn't vodka, but things like [P\u00f6yt\u00e4viina](http://www.ilmajoenmuseot.fi/museon-katkoista/poytaviina-alkon-ensimmainen-oma-tuote-on-poissa/). P\u00f6yt\u00e4viina  [was originally a potato vodka](http://www.t.fbsk.info/fi/uutiset/Poytaviina_80v/), but apparently because of the war, it was made not from grain or potato but from wood. So, it was known as \"stick br\u00e4nnvin\". About 25% of wood is hemicellulose, and sulfite chemical pulping, it is hydrolyzed into sugars, which can be fermented into ethanol. France, being on the wrong side of the front, refused to sell metal caps to Finland, so Finns had to fashion caps from wood, which only reinforced the idea of a stick br\u00e4nnvin. The name P\u00f6yt\u00e4viina (\"Table Br\u00e4nnvin\") also led to nicknames like M\u00f6\u00f6peliviina (furniture br\u00e4nnvin).

Granted, because of that it's not the most original joke I've ever made, but I'm really happy with how the comic turned out. Thanks for voting for it!\n\nContext:\n\nPanel 1 - Obvious reference to the berndmade [\"Ukraine is fast!\"](http://i.imgur.com/x6iS85J.png) Even beyond that comic, Ukraine's love for [salo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salo_(food\\)) and stealing pigs is [well](http://i.imgur.com/UyEZyQx.png) [documented.](http://i.imgur.com/YDyI7hm.png)\n\nPanel 2 - An homage to /u/Pyram1de's *excellent* comic [\"B\u0131p B\u0131p!

Wikipedia says about the 1939 movie: \"The title of the film is taken from a nursery rhyme, and bears no relation to Billy Wilder's acclaimed 1959 comedy film Some Like It Hot starring Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis.\" Or is it a remake of something else?\n\n> The Magnificent Seven vs. Seven Samurai\n\nI only watched the original of these, but I was going to watch the newer one as well because I head it was good.

Passing is very difficult, so you watch the train go 'round and 'round till the guy that got to the first corner first wins.  NASCAR, by contrast, has almost continuous passing.\n\n2)  F1 cars are less tolerant of bumping - bumping is an integral part of NASCAR (to help people, actually) but incidental contact is often shrugged off.  The cars can race closer together as a result - and of course when there is a crash, it can involve a lot of people.  One guy spinning out on a 45mph corner is virtually non-existent.\n\n3)  There is less domination by one or a few particular team due to raw money spent.  The fields are more standard and consequently more competitive.\n\n\nWhat you like is what you like, I don't generally think badly of F1 fans, other than when they pan other forms of racing as inferior, particularly when they don't really know much about it.\n\nI also periodically see the American GT series, which is sort of a mini-LeMans circuit, with multiple classes of cars on the course at one time (leading to a lot of passing) with the faster cars having the additional challenge of having to navigate through the rest of the field.", "id": "d3o86j5"}, {"comment": "NASCAR is a contact sport. If F1 is soccer, then NASCAR is American football. Its a bunch of dudes trying to wrestle a 2 ton block of solid horsepower (with almost no computer aid) around a track in the middle of a hurricane (The winds and turbulence those cars kick up is insane). \n\nThe cars are clawing and fighting their way along, and its a very aggressive sport. \n\nOn the other hand, F1 is all. About control and precision. Hitting the perfect driving lines and sticking to the apex of turns. While NASCAR is just putting your foot down and shouldering your way up through the crowd of cars. ", "id": "d3o8z4x"}, {"comment": ">While NASCAR is just putting your foot down and shouldering your way up through the crowd of cars.\n\nThis is not true at all.\n\nI won't try and argue that NASCAR requires more precision than F1. Because it doesn't. But it is not as brute-force as you think. To win a NASCAR race, you have to do a lot of mental calculations. \n\nEx: I'm running in second, the guy in first is running the same line as I am. I won't make up this gap by running the same line, so I try the high line and try to get a run off the banking to catch him in the straightaway. Going into the next turn, I dip right next to the side of his car and pull way up to the high line, taking air off of his car and making him lose downforce and momentum. Pulling off of that turn, I have the high line, thus meaning I get another run, meanwhile my competitor has to slow down a little to regain control of his car due to the lack of downforce. I now have the lead.\n\nNow it's never quite that simple, and sometimes a driver has to try many different lines before finding one that works, but that's an example of what you have to do to pass.

Notice how there was no \"shouldering your way up through a crowd of cars.\" This stereotype that NASCAR is all about flooring it and turning left is absolutely asinine and I do hope one day it disappears.", "id": "d3oebos"}, {"comment": "What I said was a gross simplification.

Passing is very difficult, and you can see the skill it takes from the driver to be able to seize the position in front of him. Bumping is frowned upon in F1 because the cars are so light and because they're moving so quickly. Even the slightest bump can send a car airborn and the results can be catastrophic if the driver is unlucky. A crash in F1 can involve anywhere from one driver to half the field. Crashes are entertaining sure, but huge pileups aren't something I want to watch. As for 45mph corners, I don't think you'll find much of that in any of the main racing leagues. I know you addressed the whole oval thing earlier, but I do like the track variety a lot in F1 and IndyCar. In regards to team parity, F1 is very much a sport centered around money and technology.

Originally regional, these cultures spread across the country as it expanded. \n\nFischer explains that Southern backcountry culture is derived from \"Scots-Irish\" (actually an intermingling of Irish, Scottish, and English) people on the borders of Northern England, Southern Scotland, and in North Ireland from the 1600s. \n\nSome markers of the Southern backcountry culture are honor, clan-orientation, a tendency toward a warrior pride, and supporting willfulness in children.  This is a result of the centuries of warfare in the borderlands where the original Scots-Irish settlers came from.\n\nThis is quite distinct from, say, Virginia culture, which was all about gentrification, hierarchy, the \"gentleman\" class, wealthy plantations, and the like.

Why is it that the allied war crimes are not as well researched as the axis ones. How come that those who are did not result in persecution of the criminals? \n\nNuremberg was meant as the first time in history where no victor's justice would be imposed on the loser, but the ignorance towards allied and especially soviet crimes stoped that right in it's tracks, besides the ethnic cleansing, which was condemned by the allies publicitly, but then they carried out the biggest ethnic cleansing in history.\n\nTo this day the ex allied nations don't persecute their war criminals in most cases. Wether it is torture or outright murder, it will never be harshly persecuted, because these countries rely heavily on their soldiers, and you get fewer recruits if you regularly imprison your baddies.\n\nWhich is why you can't respect certain armies. Not because of the individual serving, but because there is zero ambition to ensure they are clean armies, fitting for supposedly democracies.\n\nAny war is dirty for sure, but you can at least ensure that your own criminals get punished accordingly.

The soviets clearly encouraged massacres via their anti german propaganda by f.ex. Ilya Ehrenburg, who failed to discriminate between germans and nazis in general, as did he fail to discriminate between soldiers and civillians in his calls to kill germans. Later he claimed he only intended that to be applied on the german soldiers invading and massacring on soviet lands, but that's hardly more than an excuse.\n\nFact is though, that the soviets saw how that propaganda resulted in complete and utter anarchism. Drunk soldiers committing crimes and officers who would not dare to interfere, out of fear of being killed by their own men. The soviets put an effort into activly reducing the crimes, arguably with mediocre success. \n\nSo while the soviet propaganda on one hand may have played a huge role, it was rather the lack of discipline and the amount of alcohol looted that fueled soviet war crimes. If the western allied propaganda had been any worse, surely there would have been more massacres than the occasional shooting of PoWs.\n\nAlso for some warcrimes that are relativly undisputed, it would be f.ex. the Laconia incident, the battle of bismarck sea or even monte cassino.", "id": "d3dn0kg"}, {"comment": "Is it really debated though that there was a large scale ethnic cleansing in a lot of prussian territories aswell as mass rapes?

There's some consensus that abuse was widespread. But influential Russian historians are quick to refuse any allegation that the Red Army actively encouraged them.

There hasn't been a trend to assimilate everyone into broad racial categories. Claiming Canada as White doesn't make sense within a Canadian context. Also, unlike the US, ethnicity is not considered a mutually exclusive affair (i.e., single choice), rather when answering any ethnicity question is a multiple choice affair. Classifying Canada as a \"White\" country just doesn't make any modern or historic sense and is very offensive because it discriminates against the broad number of ethnic groups that are descended from European stock. This is also one of the main reason Canada is so much more diverse than the US.\n* You're misrepresenting thing.

This joke that is so bleeding obvious but seems to elude Americans to much our amusement. The fact that \"cheeky nandos\" is a thing doesn't mean British people think highly of Nandos. In fact it's notoriously shit. It's the kind of restaurant you take you girlfriend to in order to break up with her ffs because it's cheap but resembles a restaurant enough that she'll be disinclined to make a scene.\n\nCheeky means audacious, impudent, naughty and bold, like if a kid  makes a joke to their teacher, they're being cheeky. You're not being downright insubordinate like punching their teacher in the face, they're just being playfully disrespectful. Lads types in England tend to want to be cheeky, they're not the full out chavs who want to be taken seriously because they're so gangsta. They want to portray themselves as affable rogues, good with the ladies, everybody's mate, able to handle themselves but not overtly aggressive, always up for laugh. This is why cheeky was such a common word for them to overuse. Cheeky pint during their lunch break, cheeky spliff before school, cheeky blowie in the disabled lavs, whatever. Then it just started getting overused for comedic affect, cheeky pot noodle, cheeky curry, cheeky packet of crisps, things that weren't really cheeky at all.\n\nCheeky + Nandos hit a chord because it just summed up the stupidity of that culture really. Calling things cheeky all the time even when they weren't remotely cheeky, combined with the fact that Nandos is such a shitty chain restaurant that's barely above McDonalds in the scheme of things and definitely the kind of place lad types frequent, just made a perfect storm of parody.

The \"autonomous communities\" are an attempt at having your cake and eating it, too. Let me explain...\n\nI lived through the transition after the Franco regime, and I remember it vividly, although I was but a very wee lad at the time.\n\nNow. In 1977 you had a bunch of people from different political tendencies drafting up the Spanish constitution. At the time things were REALLY tense in Spain. Terrorism from both right and left; the military making angry noises and apparently half an inch away from revolting and starting a putsch; a bunch of left-wing lawyers freshly murdered by right-wing hit-men in Madrid; the Spanish Communist Party freshly legalised (which led to a bunch of very high rank commanders of the military to resign, and added to the ANGRY noises from the military...).\n\nThe whole thing was on a knife's edge.\n\nThe people drafting the constitution were doing a high-wire act without safety net. They were from all across the political spectrum, and although there were disagreements among themselves, they all knew that the situation was rather dangerous.\n\nThey accepted that some kind of self-governance should be given to Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia, at the very least. But they were also very much aware that saying outright \"OK, federal states, and that's it\" would possibly be the straw that would break the camel's back and would trigger an army revolt.\n\nSo, the more conservative drafters (who would have wanted a \"unitary\" state but were aware that it would not be really, really possible) suggested this concept of \"autonomous community\" instead. The more liberal drafters understood that it was a way of kinda \"moving towards\" federalism, at least as much as it was possible at the time.\n\nThe whole thing was a compromise. It was what was possible in the then-current situation. I have the feeling that, very likely, the drafters of the constitution themselves felt that, later on, the constitution should be amended, that it was possible to refine it and make it better. That it was a first step, the best possible compromise under the circumstances -- that nothing more than that was realistically possible.\n\nAnd so it was done... But, unfortunately, that refinement never came. The process to amend the Spanish constitution sets up a rather strict set of conditions (which were put there so that it would not end up suffering the fate of previous Spanish constitutions, which were amended at the whim of the people in power), and because this constitution was \"good enough\"... It has been left untouched for close to 40 years.\n\nNow, this Spanish constitution is the longest-lived one Spain has ever had. It has done its job. It helped give stability to the country in a very dangerous time... It was not a bad piece of work.\n\nUnfortunately, in some quarters there is great resistance to start the process of amending certain aspects of the constitution that are definitely improvable. Whether it is a feeling of fear of the unknown, a feeling of excessive reverence for \"THE\" constitution, a feeling of \"changing the basic articles of the constitution is a pain in the ass\", a feeling of \"the way this is set up right now suits our goals magnificently\", or a combination of all four... I cannot say.\n\nBut it is as if you have a temporary fix-up that ends up becoming permanent, and that is never a good thing.\n\nPity. The Spanish constitution itself is a great example of the art of the possible, and it was the best that was possible at the time. But I am of the opinion that amendments are needed. It played its role in its current form, and it needs a bit of an overhaul in order to become a more effective instrument of policy.\n\nJust my 2 eurocent! :)", "id": "d4sysnd"}, {"comment": "In software we have a saying, \"broken gets fixed, but crappy is forever.\"", "id": "d4tb5ly"}, {"comment": "Catalan Krai and Galician Autonomous Oblast agree with you.", "id": "d4srkpz"}], [{"comment": "Bloody Scots (and english, welsh and northern irish it seems)", "id": "d4sbzix"}, {"comment": "The reaction from Wales has been nothing short of hilarious.

Seems unnecessarily complicated. ", "id": "d7tn5cz"}, {"comment": "It's for historical reasons. Kanji were introduced (earliest date 50CE) much earlier than either alphabets were invented (earliest date 471CE).\n\nAlso the glyphs used in the alphabets comes from writing Chinese characters cursively. See [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Hiragana_origin.svg), top row is Chinese characters, middle row is Chinese characters written cursively, and bottom row is Hiragana (Japanese alphabet).\n\nAlso, se u/loulan pointed out, old Chinese is considered prestigious, sort of like Latin in Europe. Although few spoke Latin daily since the Roman empire fell, people nonetheless used Latin for formal records all the way to today in some fields (biology, legal, religious). Similarly, both Korea, Japan and Vietnam recorded their official history and also some official documents in Chinese even after developing their own writing system.", "id": "d7tol51"}, {"comment": "So that's why Chinese cursive, simplified Chinese and hiragana are about equally hard to read for me.\n\n", "id": "d7towa3"}, {"comment": "Interesting.

Japanese has a lot of homophones. *A lot.* Also because words aren't spaced apart or distinct in any way, which doesn't help either. Old japanese videogames, back when there wasn't enough memory to store thousands of kanji in the cartridges and stuff, would use hiragana with spaces for its text and dialogue.\n\nTo be fair, though, reading kanji does kind of feel intuitive once you learn their meanings. Deciphering meaning based on symbols rather than sets of letters is pretty fun. What is not fun is the readings that each kanji has. Even if a single kanji has, like, only 2 readings (one japanese and one chinese), there often are archaic exceptions in certain words and so on. It's really stupid in my opinion. \n\nYou literally don't know how to read a new word despite knowing its spelling. This is especially true with proper nouns. For example people from outside Osaka will frequently read Tennoji as Tenooji. It is written as \u5929\u738b\u5bfa (ten-nou-ji), but the nou reading is an exception and the standard way to read that character is ou (oo).

Remember, \"the medium is the message\". Much of what makes Japanese literature distinctive, like puns, jokes, and particular expressive styles, is dependent on the nature and form of kanji and would get lost in translation from kanji to kana. (Korea has this same problem, which is why they still have to make their students learn Chinese characters, that are never used in everyday life, in order to properly read classical Korean literature.)\n\nThis ties in to another advantage of the complexity of the Japanese writing system: there's more interesting stuff you can do and more ways to express yourself creatively with it. Different Chinese characters can be used to pronounce the same syllable, and each one has different nuances and suggests different things. You can use kanji characters for some words and kana for others, and the way you do it will have different implications as well. Getting rid of kanji would mean sacrificing that expressive flexibility.\n\nAnd then there's the technical problems: for instance, Japanese is very phonetically simple relative to other human languages, which means that all the Chinese loanwords they borrowed resulted in a ton of homophones that simply cannot be distinguished effectively without kanji.\n\n", "id": "d7tq233"}], [{"comment": "It's hard to imagine there is a time where China and Japan were actually friends.\n\nIt's words like \u81ea\u6bba that reminds us China and Japan are but one and the same.", "id": "d7t28gx"}, {"comment": "Who doesn't love some suicide.", "id": "d7t2yu7"}, {"comment": "I don't think Japan and China have ever had good relations.

We aren't really going to see a major decline in American influence for quite some time; even if the current historically unique unipolar moment ends, we'll revert to a bipolar international system like we had during the Cold War. The possibility of a decline of American status to \"first among equals\" is pretty much impossible until the 2050's even based on the most optimistic predictions for the economic growth of emerging powers, and based on China's recent economic troubles those seem likely to be inaccurate.

If you allow for a real democracy in all regards, wealth is no longer protected and politics would be about taking from each other. So you either have to limit democracy in order to maintain inequality (the sort of inequality that might be socially useful - that those who do the most get the most and so on), or  limit inequality (in a social democratic sense - do some redistribution to make sure that inequality get not out of hand) to maintain both order and democracy.\n\nThis issue was already known back then. The  modern western implementations starting in the 18th century pretty much chose the way of obstructing democracy, in a way that allows the rich to be over-represented. Initially by giving votes only to those with a certain social status and/or income, later through the structures of parliaments and senates and the political influence of the wealthy and well-connected elites.\n\nIf one looks at the Marxist/Historical materialist position of the process that lead from feudalism to state democracy and capitalism (an increasingly powerful merchant class that looked for a political framework to secure their wealth and to invest  into production)  this makes quite some sense. As a wealthy merchant you get the public legitimacy by giving everyone a bit of participation, you get the protection of your private property, and there is no authorative nobleman or king above you who can force their will on you at their discretion. \n\nObviously this step from feudalism to democracy and capitalism was quite a leap, and now the question is whether the remaining issues can be solved within capitalism, whether they cannot be solved at all, or whether there is a way communism can be implemented the way it was originally intended to, without the authoritarian aspects its second-world implementations developed.", "id": "cztl1od"}, {"comment": "Hey OP, the comic is already running stronk so I won't take it down for you to make a quick fix but handing out a [](#yellow-card) card for the use of line tool in the last panel (layering of the sky).\n", "id": "czthwoe"}, {"comment": "So no line tool with anything but panel divisions?

Invariably with poor social status, a bad upbringing often in poverty, sub-par education, substance abuse, victims of physical, mental and sexual abuse, a lack of role models and so on. Everything that creates thuggery in every society.\n\nIt is not because of the football club they support. Your point is moot. It applies as much to Scots in general never mind football fans.\n\nIt's surreal that you've linked that George Square debacle and appear to blame it on Rangers fans as if that is the causal factor. Much like the extreme Republicans that plague Scotland and were there that infamous night their football affiliation had absolutely nothing to do with it. What breeds that extremism? History and social conditions. The latter overwhelmingly fuels that antisocial behaviour. Scotland was split in the same manner from even before 1707.\n\nWhat stops the rest of the Rangers support from going rabid? What stops you?
