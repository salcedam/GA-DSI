But what exactly makes this \"lo-fi\"?", "id": "d9ly5ve"}, {"comment": "Like most genres, \"lo-fi\" is hard to define. That said, a few or more of the following statements are true regarding most tracks classified as \"lo-fi hip hop.\" \n\n1) The artist partially, or often completely, eschews the latest technology in music production (computer software). Instead, the artist uses older hardware gear such as an SP-404 or MPC. The SP-404, which is very popular among producers of \"lo-fi,\" offers several distinctive effects that are pretty-much hallmarks of \"lo-fi,\" namely: beat repeat/stutter, resonant analog-esque high-pass and low-pass filters, side-chain compression, and vinyl distortion/emulation. The first three of these are clearly evident in this song.\n\n2) The artist samples from old, damaged records or tapes. A damaged vinyl record naturally sounds \"crunchy\" or \"distorted.\" It should be noted that, while this sonic effect is theoretically similar to the distortion used on guitars in rock music, in practice, it sounds very different. Nevertheless, it is a form of distortion. Distortion entails eliminating some frequencies in order to enrich the harmonics of others. \n\n3) Both percussion and melody are slow-moving and somewhat sparse. For example, in many rap genres (think trap/drill), fast, 16th note hi-hats are very common. A lot of lo-fi productions don't have hi hats, and when they do, they're almost always 8th notes or some sort of 8th note swing. Because they are slower and more \"meandering,\" melodies in \"lo-fi\" are often comprised of longer musical phrases; instead of the common 2 or 4 bar loop found in a lot of hip-hop, \"lo-fi\" beats often use 8 (like in the track above) or 16 bar phrases.\n\n4) Technically I covered this in #1, but I'm going to repeat it on its own because it is by far the biggest commonality I have heard among \"lo-fi\" tracks: intense low-passing. That is,\nmost lo-fi tracks have very limited high frequency content, often nothing above 10khz or even 5khz. Before the digital age, it was very hard to reproduce these high frequencies. By limiting them, \"lo-fi\" achieves what might be called an \"older\" sound.", "id": "d9m37b0"}, {"comment": "I logged in to upvote and thank you. So...

Via Chicago is one of my all time favorites and opens with the line, \"I dreamed about killing you again last night, and that felt alright to me.\"\n\nEven some of Bright Eye's music can be pretty dark - Lifted, or the story's in the soil, keep your ear to the ground -- that's a great album.\n\nXIU XIU for some more experiemental, alternative music:\n\nOn the instrumental front, I think Godspeed!

It's like American's trying to play Cuban/Brazilian/African music. It's possible and it has been done before, but it usually lacks vocabulary and authenticity aside from some very specific musicians. TLDR: We grew up with this music, they didn't. \n\nAs for this, I honestly didn't like it and this is an example of guys trying to play jazz, but they're lacking a lot of basic ingredients. The first one is that there's no interaction between the band members due to Ryo not really giving space or clear direction of where he's going (not playing musical phrases.) Up until the run at the 4:00 mark, it sounds like he doesn't know what to improvise over his left hand comping. He's playing some great substitutions, but he doesn't reflect it in the right hand which makes it sound pretty weak in quite a few spots. \n\nNow compare this to McCoy Tyner's Supertrios from the same year.

It was big in Japan even before the war, being a large part of the youth subculture in the 20s and 30s, and during the occupation, it only increased in popularity and cultural penetration driven by the desire of GIs for entertainment and their interactions with the locals. There has been a ton of interplay between American and Japanese culture since Perry opened them up, and jazz wasn't overlooked. Read an early Murakami novel, they're packed with references to classic jazz records. Someone who started releasing jazz in the mid--70s and waswas born after the war like this guy almost certainly grew up exposed to jazz. They're by far the second most prolific and accomplished jazz country for a reason. \n\nThis is honestly just an ignorant post.

If you can sit here and say that they are the same, then you really don't know American history as well as you think.  \n\nMy whole original point was explaining why a lot of Japanese players have a different sound than players from the US.

Its like being a person who cannot eat meat but you're against vegetarians and vegetarian food because long ago some vegetarian cult allowed a sociopath to get into power and he caused the whole cult to destroy itself.

Still not what we think of, really. \n\nI feel like [American Football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Uj2JpvsvX4) is a good example of when emo started moving in the direction we associate with it today. Heavy indie influences with the prototypical wispy guitars and washed out vocals. Soon after, what most people think of as emo emerged e.g. Dashboard Confessional, The Get Up Kids, Jimmy Eat World, Fall Out Boy, etc. \n\nAs is the way of things, soon after reaching mainstream success emo began to fall off and out of popular music. It's been making a slow revival since the early 2010s. There's a bunch of examples, like [Dads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SX3KNG6exM), [The World is a Beautiful Place and I am No Longer Afraid to Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68GruRH19Lc), [The Front Bottoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PNAGxtJHcU), and [Radiator Hospital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDaFEGxOsXg). \n\nYou'll sometimes see bands that fit his description described as math rock. Dads in particular. There's definitely a strain of technical emo music still kicking.\n\nAnyway, now you know about emo!

So when I think of those bands, and the ones that I listed, It's hard for me to also categorize someone like Sunny Day Real Estate as punk. I just don't hear it in their sound. Oddly, Sunny Day's wiki lists them as 'emo' and articles on a Googley-fu say that they essentially founded the genre. (I did not know that). \n\nAnd I'm not taking anything away from them. Great band and certainly influential. But I just don't hear them as a punk band. If anything, a post-grunge band. \n\nBut that raises, I think, an interesting question and perspective on 'what is punk rock?' Ramshackle Glory, I believe sets a great portrait for folk punk.

It has blended with pop and become more mass friendly and commercialized. Punk didn't evolve, it sold out. That being said, this band fucking rocks. ", "id": "d1kehju"}, {"comment": "Please at least think a bit before you make bold accusations like my statement being ''fantastical disparaging horseshit''.\n\nPunk Rock grew out of Garage Rock. Garage Rock got it's name from people finding those bands amateurs, young amateurs who might rehearse in their parents garage. At the time, Garage Rock was not considered a distinct genre. It was considered Rock N' Roll. Rock N' Roll is the first, traditional, original genre of Rock. Punk Rock (Punk as in a young/inexperienced/violent person) is just rock n' roll stripped down, in it's rawest, purest, straight to the point form. \n\nWhat punks hated were things like PROGRESSIVE ROCK. Or any rock band that played soft and slow.  That's what they rejected. Not Rock N' Roll, Rock N' Roll was what Punk pretty much directly grew out of. Garage bands like MC5, The Sonics, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, etc. Which some now call ''proto-punk'', as they layed the groundwork for punk music.\n\nPunk did evolve. Into many different styles, some of which are extreme. How is playing a different way selling out? Are all Crust Punks selling out because they make a specific sound of Hardcore Punk with (Extreme) Metal elements? I assume you'd answer no, and there's a million of those bands.\n\nA lot of of early punk actually has elements of pop music. The Ramones were heavily inspired by 60's bubblegum pop. They're considered one of the first punk rock bands, and even sang about girls n' high school n shit. I don't see how adding melody and hooks to the genre is inherently a negative thing. Commercialized? Only a small amount of more well known bands. Most punk bands are just making whatever the fuck they want to make, and there's tons of em still making the same hardcore punk songs over and over.\n\nIf you think this band rocks and did not ''sell out'', then there's tons of Punk out there that sounds different from what it used to that you'll probably like, as this is NOT the traditional sound found in 70's/80's Punk Rock music, and it has pop elements.", "id": "d1kfg1d"}, {"comment": "Punk Rock came from bands like Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, MC5, the New York Dolls, and T-Rex.\n\nIt developed on two continents and branched into a bunch of different sounds, yeah. Your original comment narrowly described punk as a stupid simplification of Rock and Roll and a lesser evolved form of modern music. That \"progress\" notion is bullshit. \n\nThere are all kinds of punk from the British scene with The Clash and the Sex Pistols and Crass and X-Ray Spex and the Exploited. Or the New York scene with the Ramones and the Slits and Patti Smith and a shit ton of other great bands. \n\nI personally prefer the 80's hardcore scene (Black Flag, JFA, Wasted Youth, Dead Kennedys). My dad is the bassist for 7 Seconds and my uncle is the singer. I grew up in this shit and lived for it. \n\nI get why people want to call this modern fusion of a million types of music \"punk\" but it's really fucking not. Does it incorporate punk elements? Sure. All forms of music borrow some things from each other. That's how culture works. We share it and absorb, adopt, or appropriate it. The same reason people felt like calling Blink 182 a punk band was a misnomer and instead were placed into genre called pop punk, I don't think PUP fits the punk label. \n\nIf we're going to arbitrarily call music whatever we want we might as well just call everything classical music since most genres developed from that.

It's DIY, everyone could pick up an instrument and play if they had something to say. I never meant to say the genre made ''progress'' now, it's just that it started as only simplified rock n' roll.  You know, the Damned, the Heartbreakers, the Clash, Sex Pistols, Stiff Little Fingers, etc. Simple does not mean worse, in fact I love simple music, it has a lot to do with why Punk's my favourite genre.\n\nPunk has become a broad umbrella, just like Metal. Metal does not refer just to traditional Heavy Metal like Dio. It can mean a vareity of sounds that evolved from Heavy Metal. Ofcourse, at some point it's so different it can get called it's own thing. Emo (as in Sunny Day Real Estate or Braid or some shit) evolved from Punk, but it became entirely it's own thing and not a punk genre.\n\nI like to call things punk in the broadest sense possible.

That knocks out 99% of the music people know about right there, including all the hyped darlings dominating other music lists. We check popularity on last.fm, spotify, and youtube, culling anything that's big or internationally known. We try to be less hard on non-US artists with regional fame.\n\nThen the mods sit in IRC and listen, thread by thread, album by album. If it bores us, it's out. If it blows more than 2 people's hair back, it's probably in. We only pass judgement on genres we love, so there are guys for hiphop, guys for metal, guys for electronic, etc - everyone has a specialty or three. We make lists, try to sort em into categories based on whatever comes in with the haul, then try to cobble together playlists from them.\n\nAt some point we run out of time or patience (or both!) and say fuck it, it's done.

I do appreciate the hard work you guys have put in, it seems comprehensive for the genres. What I'm really unable to find is harder edged indie, or rather something that rocks hard without confirming too much to genre conventions of something like metal or hardcore. Stuff I've enjoyed lately on that end would be the last Titus Andronicus album, the God Damn debut and Metz. I found a grunge band called Milk Teeth the other day, they're great. I also really enjoyed the Joanna Newsom record. \n\nMost of the indie stuff I'm finding is too abstract or chillwave-y and the math rock is tending towards the widdly rather than muscular or big (I really enjoyed Caspian and the last Alpha Male Tea Party).\n\nBut really I think I'm just feeling old and out of touch with all this new young people music haha", "id": "cz4gumd"}, {"comment": "Perhaps [something like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-mBP4f0d5o) The album is [here.](https://drewofthedrew.bandcamp.com/) Found that one a bit too late for the list.

There is still new good thrash but compare it to the amount of black metal albums that people get excited over and it is staggering.

And in all this time (three months), I've only seen Caravan Digger mentioned twice on Reddit, and their video that I saw was posted on their own youtube-channel, not on rehosted channels, and it did not have a lot of views in Nov-Dec, it was in the low five figures IIRC.\n\nIf /r/ListenToThis has such narrow and obscure qualifications for admittance in its ranks that \"Lonely Digger\", three months old, may not be counted, you are getting progressively more elitist than is good for you.\n\nAlso, no bot has come for me so far.", "id": "cz508f4"}, {"comment": "The analogy (not argument) is flawless. Metallica was a founding, formative, and top-popularity metal band. If you listen to any metal at all, then you know Metallica. Caravan Palace enjoys a similar position as one of the first and most well known electroswing bands. If you listen to electroswing at all, you know Caravan Palace. Parov Stelar is the only other electroswing artist at that level of fame who has been around since the beginning.\n\nCaravan's [last.fm numbers](http://www.last.fm/music/Caravan+Palace) are over our threshold, which means they don't get consideration in the bestof list. \n\nRemoving them has nothing to do with elitism - we're not removing them for quality reasons, they are a top quality world class artist. It is because they are now *off-topic* for a subreddit that is *exclusively* about new and overlooked artists. They are no longer a new artist or an overlooked one, and most subscribers here have already heard of them. \n\nEvery single artist in this bestof will be banned from here eventually for the same reasons, to make room for more artists that don't even exist yet. Turnover helps keeps this place from becoming boring and repetitive. Just take a look at our [2popular4us](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/wiki/2popular4us) list for more examples like this.\n\nWe *would* like to have a new release exception for submissions, where for up to three months, new releases at a higher popularity threshold (up to 7-8 million which would include Caravan at the moment) could still be submitted, but *only* if the track was from that new release album. Unfortunately the bots aren't smart enough to do this yet, so we're stuck being more draconian than we'd necessarily like to be about new releases.\n\nGenerally, if an artist outgrows listentothis it's time for them to move to /r/music and they'll be popular enough to do well over there. If they aren't being posted, you should be the one posting them. Moderators have no control whatsoever over what people choose to post, they can only choose to remove it afterwards.\n\nBots here don't police comments for music, they only deal with link submissions. Comments are pretty much unmoderated except for some standard anti-dox and anti-racism filters most defaults run. If people want to share Caravan in the comments (or talk about Metallica) we don't mind that at all.", "id": "cz50vad"}, {"comment": "Fair enough!

It uses way to many of its own assets including the singing so definitely not.\n\nHeres what vaporwave is in my mind, as someone that spent many months obsessed with, it hence my name. \n\nVaporwave is a music that trys to first emulate and then build upon Pop songs from the late 70s - early 90's. Of course the easiest way to sound like pop from them is to sample it, so much of it is. \n\nIt is also a mainstay of the genre to add that as the name suggest vaporfeel by warping the samples and adding a bunch of reverb to make it sound relatively echoed. From there the possibilities are endless. We have the IMO boring stuff from Vektroid like Floral Shoppe that just choose to highlight the extremes of the vaporwave ideal. But then we have artists like Saint Pepsi, Dan Mason and Luxury Elite trying to make songs that have there own vibes and genuinely traditional song structures but with Vaporwave feel and *nostalgia* vibes (downbeat low BPM) still present\n\nThen we have artists like Vanilla and Flamingosis which I like to call Vaporbeats but they are really so much more than beats yet they are made just like a hip-hop producers would make a beat. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzKHTCEhsp8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9J8CYsXjS0\n\nThese songs are far from the classics like Macintosh Plus but they still have that same dedication to the Pop music of the 80's and the relaxed nostalgia filled vibes.\n\nThere is also future funk which is IMO still vaporwave but still a distinct entity.

Last time this was posted I ended up doing a bit of research, and as lovely as this album is, it was from a period where Japanese were still coming to terms with the form by mastering its style, mostly to get paid at some gigs.\n\nThough the artist is surely Japanese, the music itself is simply a fine rendition of American style jazz, with many lovely and impressive technical flourishes taken direct from the American school. If I showed you a picture of a black Chicago jazzman and claimed he had recorded this album, you would nod your head, because of course he did. I would be lying, but you see my point.\n\nAt the time of recording, in 76, the only thing making this music Japanese is the nationality of the performer. It has yet to take on a distinct Japanese flavor, has not yet begun to reflect the nation's own very distinct and singular culture.

As time progressed the genre went all sorts of different directions and that's why there are a bunch of different subgenres. A lot of metal fans don't like putting metalcore in with metal because it can be 'poppy' and isn't always as heavy as other types of metal. Or just because they don't like the sound but want to say \"I love all metal\".\n\n____\n\nIf you have time, mapofmetal.com is a good way to see the history & branches that metal has, it's a good way to find new types of metal if you're already a metal fan.\n\nIf you just want some quick examples of *why* metal has so many subgenres, I'll post a few songs that I doubt many would say \"aren't metal\", I also doubt many people would say these \"sound the same\".

My knowledge is very basic in most cases, and I don't have any speciality in knowing instruments or song structures.\n\nThat said, I can clearly hear what is an influence and what is metal. The simplest way to explain this is to go listen to fundamental metal, like Black Sabbath, or Slayer, Venom, Mercyful fate. You will hear that the music is very simple and is based on few key structures. Most important is the riff. Most of the time, you can't have metal without a riff. \n\nThere also needs to be distortion, and the tempo must be fairly consistent. If the song has more breakdowns than riffs, it's probably a subgenre of hardcore, not metal. \n\nEven simpler, metal just means music that is developed from traditional metal. So stuff like Deep Purple, Cream can have very much metal-esque songs in structure and progression, but their production (no distortion, clean singing) makes it definitely not metal, even if it is proto-metal (meaning metal before distortion, I'd say, or just before metal was defined).\n\nAnd yes, I don't care about my personal opinion.

Core music generally follows a syncopated rhythm, unlike the straight-beat that is so prevalent in metal. I'm not sure how familiar with electronic music, but think of it like the difference between straight-beat genres like House and Trance and break-beat genres like Dubstep and Drum & Bass. Core band often take use of time-signature changes (or time signatures other than 4-4), tempo changes, breakdowns, and other stuff from jazz. They also take a lot of influence from punk, sometimes even straddling the line between punk and metal.\n\nAlso the vocals are significantly different, though to an outsider they both just sound like someone screaming into the mic.\n\nAlso, both genres HATE each other. Now this may not always be true, but I've been to a few metal-hardcore festivals and as a metal fan, I've always noticed how the metal heads constantly make fun of the hardcore kids. They are very different sub-cultures in every way. Metal band generally do circle pits where people run in circles and shove each other.

We'd been in contact for a long time before that.  It's common, when someone passes, that people tend to embellish their excellence.  With Erik, no embellishment is necessary. When we were a young radio show, run by two college sophomores who didn't know what the hell we were doing, Erik was one of the first to give us positive feedback and attention.  He helped us feel like what we were doing - archiving music we found meaningful, and bringing forth the human element of the artist - was a worthy endeavor that we should believe in.\n\nWe met in person, and we were fast friends.  He had an incredible ability to make you feel both so important and so equal at the same time.  We recorded this session after a show they played with Ramshackle Glory, Days N Daze, and Moon Bandits.  We walked around chatting until we found a spot we liked, opened up a flask, and just hung out and passed it back and forth for a while.  \n\nWell afterwards, Erik still kept in touch, even when I didn't do a good job of doing so myself.  He'd take the time to send us vinyl, just because he knew I loved vinyl.  Last week, we did a tribute to his record label, Fistolo Records, on-air.  He thanked me for doing so, and said he was glad I enjoyed the vinyl he sent.  These were the last words we exchanged.\n\nThere was a tweet that went out by the Upper Darby police department earlier this week, saying Erik was missing.  He was a risk because of some emotional issues.\n\nToday, his wife let his friends and fans know that Erik was no longer with us.  Several people came to me, asking about the cause of death.  I don't know.  These moments in which we experience such unfiltered interactions with mortality, I charge myself to do what seems right.  To me, that's supporting his loved ones, and remembering the times we shared. I'll also ask that, out of respect for Erik and those close to him, that we don't ask or speculate about the cause of death at this time.  Listen to and share his music, and let other people know what sort of person he was.\n\nI miss him deeply, and I can already tell that I'm going to think about him every day.  Part of me is still waiting to find out that this is a misunderstanding, or a joke of some kind.  I'm waiting for the \"Just kidding, guys!  I'm totally fine!  Let's rock!\"  I'd be pissed at Erik for all of 10 seconds before I'd be overcome with gratitude that he's okay.\n\nI'll be raising a glass to Erik tonight.  Now, I hope to just share a piece of who my friend was with all of you.\n\nMy sincere best,  \nAlec / A Fistful of Vinyl"], [31, "Holy fuck, this is.... this hurts a lot. Erik was one of my idols.

We'd been in contact for a long time before that.  It's common, when someone passes, that people tend to embellish their excellence.  With Erik, no embellishment is necessary. When we were a young radio show, run by two college sophomores who didn't know what the hell we were doing, Erik was one of the first to give us positive feedback and attention.  He helped us feel like what we were doing - archiving music we found meaningful, and bringing forth the human element of the artist - was a worthy endeavor that we should believe in.\n\nWe met in person, and we were fast friends.  He had an incredible ability to make you feel both so important and so equal at the same time.  We recorded this session after a show they played with Ramshackle Glory, Days N Daze, and Moon Bandits.  We walked around chatting until we found a spot we liked, opened up a flask, and just hung out and passed it back and forth for a while.  \n\nWell afterwards, Erik still kept in touch, even when I didn't do a good job of doing so myself.  He'd take the time to send us vinyl, just because he knew I loved vinyl.  Last week, we did a tribute to his record label, Fistolo Records, on-air.  He thanked me for doing so, and said he was glad I enjoyed the vinyl he sent.  These were the last words we exchanged.\n\nThere was a tweet that went out by the Upper Darby police department earlier this week, saying Erik was missing.  He was a risk because of some emotional issues.\n\nToday, his wife let his friends and fans know that Erik was no longer with us.  Several people came to me, asking about the cause of death.  I don't know.  These moments in which we experience such unfiltered interactions with mortality, I charge myself to do what seems right.  To me, that's supporting his loved ones, and remembering the times we shared. I'll also ask that, out of respect for Erik and those close to him, that we don't ask or speculate about the cause of death at this time.  Listen to and share his music, and let other people know what sort of person he was.\n\nI miss him deeply, and I can already tell that I'm going to think about him every day.  Part of me is still waiting to find out that this is a misunderstanding, or a joke of some kind.  I'm waiting for the \"Just kidding, guys!  I'm totally fine!  Let's rock!\"  I'd be pissed at Erik for all of 10 seconds before I'd be overcome with gratitude that he's okay.\n\nI'll be raising a glass to Erik tonight.  Now, I hope to just share a piece of who my friend was with all of you.\n\nMy sincere best,  \nAlec / A Fistful of Vinyl", "id": "d5dxaog"}, {"comment": "I'm sorry for your loss, I love songs from under the sink .

Also, if you're willing to watch shows subtitled often the voices are less annoying in Japanese (though not always... sometimes the Japanese is worse).\n\nIf you want some examples of other anime with generally more serious tones I'd say check out some of these:\n\n[Psycho-Pass](https://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass)\n\n[Erased](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi) (Boku dake ga inai machi)\n\n[Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero?q=fate%2F)\n\n[Death Note](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note?q=death) (Though one of the English voices might be annoying to you, the story as a whole is pretty interesting and grounded.

It's not the same type of tone as anything else on this list, but is definitely different from the typical type of anime you seem not to like).\n\n\nThere's tons of other series and movies that I haven't seen that fit this mold as well. But those are the only ones I can recommend you from having personally watched them.\n\nAlso on my future watch-list is [Parasyte](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22535/Kiseijuu__Sei_no_Kakuritsu?q=parasy) and [Tokyo Ghoul](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22319/Tokyo_Ghoul?q=tokyo%20) which I've heard are good shows in a similar vein.", "id": "da8enhu"}, {"comment": "There's definitely much more to see than what may appear at first glance, as the most popular or newest shows tend to be pretty mediocre/bad.

There are a lot of albums that have similar a e s t h e t i c like [tompabeats - harbor lp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76PHzENMQ04&t=339s), or [Piero Piccioni - Camille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBPFCmPlA0&t=73s), [Neat Beats - Cosmic Surgery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6kGg31G0As), and even a less \"vibrant\" one, [Deru - 1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11JITPeYAWs&t=650s). If you really like the jazz feel that some of the earlier ones give off then I would highly recommend looking into Brubeck, Coltrane, and Mingus among many others. If you want to see jazz applied in interesting ways especially with hip hop, then take a look over to Tribe Called Quest or Jazz Liberatorz...They have super cool implementations. Another really weird jazz that is probably the furthest out from these groups stylistically would be BadBadNotGood, and they have super cool implementations of a sort of minimalist, electronic sounding stuff..I would recommend all their albums but BBNG 2 is probably the furthest one out...I mean there's a ton of all of this stuff, all you gotta do is look for it. Really interesting to see how styles change over time and how they are innovated on, for specific artists, and for genres as a whole.\n\nEdit - also if you want to get into odd, lofty, surreal music, I don't think I could recommend [St. Vincent - Actors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uTAk58YJXI&list=PLZqsyBiYZFQ0bf6rl2g8mH-89BAkvZxmk) enough; probably one of my all time favorite albums just because of the unique sound and feel that it gives off.

Instead out uses a more OO like approach to modularity I think. Which is one of the things I would like to look at in the language.

As you know, black on black shootings occur at a very high rate in the USA, especially in inner city areas. This is due to drugs and gang violence. \n\nThe point of the video is that the black man who has been shot is on display at a museum/gallery for the white people to watch with mild interest from a place of complete safety, which is analogous to how white people are reacting to the predicament of inner city black communities. They hear about the violence through their TVs in the safety of their homes, but aren't particularly concerned about it. It is more like they hear it with mild interest, as if the stories of what blacks are doing to each other is more entertaining than anything else. \n\nI don't think it is really blaming white people for their inaction. It seems to just be a song about the reality of the situation in regards to how white people think about the black communities situations, which is to say that they don't really give it too much thought. More of just an occasional passing thought, as you would perhaps think about sea otters for a few brief minutes while at an aquarium. Or how you might think about how tigers are endangered. Sad, definitely, but what are you to do about it? You've got enough on your life's plate already.\n\nThat's the video. The video is about white people's perception.\n\nThe lyrics are not at all about that, I don't think. The lyrics are about the black people's perception and how they are thinking about this. He lists off a bunch of things you might hear black people saying about their circumstances. *I need to get more focused* followed by statements like *I need to smoke forever*. It is that inner fight of a poor black man where he knows his situation is bad and that he needs to take action to get a better life for his family and himself, but at the same time the weight of all the effort it would take to accomplish that is so overwhelming that he surrenders himself to getting high or goofing off or whatever.\n\nAnd the real finality of both the video and the lyrics are the image of the man who is shot. It shows that no matter how the white people react or what the black man thinks, he'll end up shot (metaphorically). It suggests that many black males often end up dead or in prison very young.\n\nI think one word to describe the feel of the song is hopelessness, which probably resonates strongly with a lot of inner city blacks.", "id": "d9c6kzi"}, {"comment": "On point.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add this is a great analysis of the song. More than half the comments in here are saying its got a dope beat or this shit sucks.

I don't think I fear death itself, but I fear pain and every time I get behind the wheel, all I can think about is getting in an accident in which I am badly hurt or dying and in pain. Everything about driving freaks me out. From cars to roads to other drivers. I have social anxiety but recently driving has been stressing me out more than anything else. I can't pinpoint when and why it started (maybe because of /r/watchpeopledie) but I'm terrified. And it's a bummer because I loved driving. ", "id": "da97cj7"}, {"comment": "I've never seen that sub Reddit but I expect based on the title alone it's lots of those Russian dash cam videos. I suspect it's not very helpful to dive into that sub for you. I personally won't go anywhere near it even to see it's like.\n\nHave you ever been in a car accident yourself? I have been in a few and, perhaps oddly, that hasn't changed my feeling about driving in a bad way. Probably the opposite. Older cars were designed to survive accidents under the assumption if the car is not damaged, the people won't be. That isn't modern thinking. Today cars are heavily scrutinized for impacts of many varieties. Frontal, side on, offset frontal. They are designed to collapse up to the point of the internal structure so that the crushing actually absorbs a lot of the impact momentum in a crash. Modern cars have turned to \"crumple zones\" and such concepts as simply installing thick reinforcing bars inside doors. Sometimes they're not named very helpfully. \"Side intrusion protection\" doesn't sound as comforting as \"big thick bars of strong steel reinforcement inside the doors\". But they're there in a lot of newer cars, though unfortunately almost invisible except for little branding badges. Nor does \"supplementary restraint system\" or SRS but all that means is \"hey, moron, don't think you can stop using your *primary* safety systems (seat belts) because we've provided these *supplementary* (air bags) systems\". Another one is \"seat belt pre-tensioners\". Seat belts act by locking when they detect you're moving faster than you should be relative to the car around you. I'm not an engineer but AFAIK they're traditionally mechanical without the assistance of electric sensors. There's always that short detection phase that allows you to yank them into place without them locking but also means your body is thrown a little before locking kicks in to hold your body back into a safer position. Pre tensioners take that lag away with electric sensors acting faster to put extra pulling tension on the seat belt before (pre) the normal lock kicks in. That way your body is held tight against the seat in a safer position.\n\nThese are good features to have in safety terms. They have taken the safety of cars forward significantly. If you see videos of cars having accidents and the front or rear crumbling up to the bottom of the windscreen and think that's a bad thing, try looking at how well the safety cell of the core passenger compartment has often remained intact. Sure the people involved are going to be sore but they'll often have minor injuries from airbag 'punches' or pre-tensioner bruises but compared to what could have happened, those injuries are generally very minor and they'll recover quickly.\n\nMaybe try searching for videos demonstrating the safety features of today's cars instead of the biased view of all those bad crashes. For every bad crash I expect there's several near misses and safe crashes that do not get published to the 'tube because they're not as 'dramatic'.\n\nThe inter web really can be a bad place for those of us suffering anxiety and other issues. It's full of endless biased content that encourages us to go down rabbit holes until we're so freaked out, within minutes at times, when we simply don't need to be. At least not from that source. Best to apply your own sensible personal filters where possible and it sounds like you're already aware of what parts of the Interweb aren't so good for your health so that's a great start.", "id": "da98jf9"}], [{"comment": "I love listening to the Lord of the Rings soundtrack on Spotify for calming background music.

Shortly after, they were invited on two separate West Coast tours: first with Spectrum (featuring Sonic Boom of Spacemen 3) and then with The Telescopes (on their first-ever U.S. tour). \n \nIn 2007 LSD's self-titled debut EP (Mind Expansion) sold out from the record label and distributor before the official release date. It was subsequently picked up and reissued on vinyl (Deep Space Recordings, 2008). Around this time, LSD was also featured on three compilations: Mind Expansion Vol. 1, M.E. Vol. 2, and \"Take Me on the Wildest Spree,\" a \u201cnugazer\u201d compilation released by Australia's Rubber Records (a division of EMI).\n\n> The momentum from their early shows and sold-out EP paved the way for a busy three three years of West Coast shows, a U.S. tour, and a handful of festival dates as LSD shared the bill with the likes of Dead Meadow, Martin Rev (of Suicide), and DJs Anton Newcombe (Brian Jonestown Massacre), Nick Jago (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club), and Colm O'Coissoig (My Bloody Valentine).\n\n> In the early hours of December 21, 2010, LSD were bio-holographically informed that humanity was exactly two years away from a near-spontaneous metamorphosis into a more highly evolved state of consciousness. To prepare, LSD went underground the very next day to explore new sonic frontiers while committing to a two-year vow of virtual silence by ending all non-essential communication.\n\n> As the hibernation comes to an end, it also marks a new beginning. Expect updates soon on a busy 2013 that will include shows, travels, and new releases to celebrate our collective arrival, offer psychic healing, and help facilitate a smooth transition to our new dimension.\n\n> --Mind Expansion, 2012 Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/LSD+and+the+Search+for+God): 38,440 listeners, 568,813 plays  \n tags: *shoegaze, psychedelic, experimental, dream pop, post-rock*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0."], [16, "In case anyone is curious, yes, this EP is amazing on LSD"], [11, "I wish God was with us.

Shortly after, they were invited on two separate West Coast tours: first with Spectrum (featuring Sonic Boom of Spacemen 3) and then with The Telescopes (on their first-ever U.S. tour). \n \nIn 2007 LSD's self-titled debut EP (Mind Expansion) sold out from the record label and distributor before the official release date. It was subsequently picked up and reissued on vinyl (Deep Space Recordings, 2008). Around this time, LSD was also featured on three compilations: Mind Expansion Vol. 1, M.E. Vol. 2, and \"Take Me on the Wildest Spree,\" a \u201cnugazer\u201d compilation released by Australia's Rubber Records (a division of EMI).\n\n> The momentum from their early shows and sold-out EP paved the way for a busy three three years of West Coast shows, a U.S. tour, and a handful of festival dates as LSD shared the bill with the likes of Dead Meadow, Martin Rev (of Suicide), and DJs Anton Newcombe (Brian Jonestown Massacre), Nick Jago (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club), and Colm O'Coissoig (My Bloody Valentine).\n\n> In the early hours of December 21, 2010, LSD were bio-holographically informed that humanity was exactly two years away from a near-spontaneous metamorphosis into a more highly evolved state of consciousness. To prepare, LSD went underground the very next day to explore new sonic frontiers while committing to a two-year vow of virtual silence by ending all non-essential communication.\n\n> As the hibernation comes to an end, it also marks a new beginning. Expect updates soon on a busy 2013 that will include shows, travels, and new releases to celebrate our collective arrival, offer psychic healing, and help facilitate a smooth transition to our new dimension.\n\n> --Mind Expansion, 2012 Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/LSD+and+the+Search+for+God): 38,440 listeners, 568,813 plays  \n tags: *shoegaze, psychedelic, experimental, dream pop, post-rock*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0.", "id": "d7yujlj"}], [{"comment": "In case anyone is curious, yes, this EP is amazing on LSD", "id": "d7z2ucv"}, {"comment": "i'll have to form my on opinion on that....for science!", "id": "d7z9r93"}, {"comment": "off-topic from the actual post, but i just came here to say i saw Tame Impala in a small venue two hits deep. i've never felt closer eternity\n\nedit: what i meant to say is everyone should see Kevin Parker's masterpiece live, drugs or no drugs. both experiences changed my life. definitely a modern Pink Floyd as far as visual/sonic progressiveness. also l everyone who enjoys either that or OP's linked group should check out Strawberry Alarm Clock - Incense and Peppermints and Os Mutantes - Os Mutantes. classic psych pop. also you can try Blind Faith - Blind Faith if you like Steve Winwood or you can dig classic/non-modern-prog type psych rock\n\ndouble edit: ooooh and if you can dig any modern electronic stuff like Ta-Ku or Cashmere Cat or Vanilla, check out Shigeto - No Better Time Than Now. very groovy, very rhythmically and melodically explorative. i also recommend this album to jazz fans who might like to give edm (i use this in the loose sense of electronically produced music that you could probably dance to) a try if they found something heady enough. best comparison is like dosing and listening to Tycho (minus all the house breakbeats) or Bibio (especially because of the use of a wide variety of percussion samples and use of very unique instrumentation of other samples). very tasty. god-speed you feels seekers", "id": "d7zr3uq"}, {"comment": "I saw them on some 2C-B, it was a spiritual experience.

The only difference being, of course, the internet wasn't around to facilitate mass discussion and criticism.\n\nPersonally, I think the appeal comes from the percussive nature it adds to people's vocals. It brings resonance to unexpected syllables, and allows singers to savour certain words they might not have been able to do with a \"straighter\" enunciation. I think Glaspy employs it well, adding a grittier rasp and growl that makes it sound like it's on purpose, but there's definitely an abundance of pop princesses out there singing in indie-girl voice without the same personality or control.\n\n*And I will argue with you on this, fight me.\n\n(Edit: typos.)", "id": "d71x1gy"}, {"comment": "I appreciate your analysis.

What's funny, though, is as you rehearse and play a song to death, the emotional immediacy of it often wanes.\n\nI think that's learned behaviour, because you can hear in different decades different seemingly natural ways of singing certain passages. Compare how one of the pop divas of the early 90s (Carey, Dion) would have \"naturally\" sung emotionally intense pieces. \n\nCome to think of it, the same applies to other instruments, especially lead instruments. How would BB King phrase something, how would Clapton do the same, and how would Malmsteen oil it all up?\n\n*edit:* Having very briefly listen to *The Thrill is gone* played by King, Clapton,  Moore, and Satriani/Vai you can hear the transition in styles; from King's melancholic and resigned soft dynamic playing (with *brilliant* vibratos), to Clapton's more direct and tonally slightly less constrained, more haughty and less punctuated playing with wide bends and slow vibrato, but longer phrases, via Moore - more aggressive, a lot more chords, faster phrases, more ascending phrases, more excitement - to Vai and Satriani, which are a warning against taking drugs I think. I don't know how to describe it. It's noise (artificial harmonics, tremolo and extreme bends) with legato of disharmonic chords (Vai just lets some sort of minor 2nd dimished fifth chord ring a few times). Satriani seems to have forgotten how to play for a while in the middle. Then there's the completely inappropriate shredding through minor scales when they seemingly get tired of the noise. I'd describe that as \"murderous and psychotic\", but in truth that isn't even the same song any more.", "id": "d724w7x"}, {"comment": "Cooooould you link to these?

No other artists to look for to make a band on, no instruments to buy, no studio to rent. Just a bit of music theory and some music software.\n\nHell, look at Future Funk, which also likes to rear its ugly head on this sub from time to time. Take 80s jazz/disco fusion track from Japan, speed it up to 1.25x normal playback, throw a new rhythm line beneath it, add a few effects before chorus and bridges, you have a new track. Get good at that, you could shit out a \"new\" track in *hours*.

Showmanship is key! Tommy Emmanuel's [Classical Gas](https://youtu.be/7lGJTkcpmWI) is the first piece that comes to mind. Mike Dawes' other pieces come to mind as well. Among all the contemporary fingerstyle pieces you've heard, which ones actually connected with you and made you feel something?\n\nFor me, the other kind are the ones who manage to put in much emotion to their pieces. Instead of impressing people, they want to make people cry or something, from what they feel rather than what they hear or see. For Candyrat artists, I think of McKee's [Rylynn](https://youtu.be/JsD6uEZsIsU) and Dufour's [These Moments](https://youtu.be/YQlyHbu0zz4). Of course one may argue that being this second kind of guitarist is more compositional than skill, and that it's a skill that isn't mutually exclusive from the first; but I think you can know an artist enough through his songs.\n\nNaudo Rodrigues is the best guitarist for me. He can play with skill and showmanship, but he also manages to tap into our heartstrings, making us feel stuff. I link you Lionel Richie's [Hello](http://youtube.com/watch?v=Sp4o-EFmUAQ), Earth Wind and Fire's [September](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6F2gRcoTa1k), and [Mambo Number Five](https://youtube.com/watch?v=pvu67Cr0RPU).

Paper Tiger makes beats for a hip-hop collective called Doomtree, so his work with them has a more porper hip-hop vibe but these fit more with being straight instrumental or having more porper vocals.  Check out his track Speedmetal with Dessa (who's part of Doomtree).  Long Arm and Paper Tiger are the only two I know of who really hit this spot of 'more than a hip-hop beat, but chill, but also uses more traditional instrumentation in their music' but depending on how far out you want to swing I think Nebulo can sort of tangentially fit in with them.

It's the powdered leaf of a southeast Asian tree (mitragyna speciosa) that has very mild and little abusable (for a few pharmacological reasons I could yap all day about) opioid effect that is currently legal in the US. The DEA was about to make it schedule I on September 30th, but so much outcry has caused them to delay the decision, so I'd recommend they buy some now while they can. I've given a small dose, in tea form, to friends who have been detoxing *hard*, and it made *all* of their withdrawal symptoms disappear (for the 4-6 hours of Kratom's duration, but when they drank the tea for the 3 or so days, they stopped having any symptoms at all).

Players characterized as belonging to this genre often use unconventional \"extended technique\" to produce complex, engaging performances combining melody, rhythm, and percussion on a single instrument\n\nNow, this description isn't the end-all-be-all of fingerstyle; to some people the term will undoubtedly mean something else (as it always goes when trying to classify music).  So don't take it as canonical, but more as an illustration of where the genre stands at present, at least in its most active form.  Not that this simplifies things per se, but hopefully it clears up some of the confusion regarding my terminology!  Part of the difficulty here is that the genre isn't named after a location of origin or a sonic description\u2014as is so often the case\u2014but rather arose as a catch-all term for a technical approach to an instrument, found in many styles of music.

The Grammies almost all but forgot anything requiring physical musicianship, and caters to burlesque acts and rappers that haven't generated note one from a traditional instrument in their lives. I really hope the day returns when it's cool to sign up for music lessons again, and to learn what scratches and ink marks are on sheet music are for.

I think the answer is absolutely distraction free and as focused as humanly possible.  How to describe this idea is lengthy and difficult beyond this point.  \n\nWe can all debate on the subtle degrees of how distracting this or that is, but think of it like this.  Pick up a book and try to read the pages of that book, now try to sing a song you've never sang before, or even really listen to the music.  Can you truly do both without your ability to perform either task suffering?  Driving isn't a mundane, static idea.  Driving is an extremely varied idea with an endless degree of variables in a constant state of flux.  \n\nTo give this statement a bit more credibility;\n\nhttps://youtu.be/t8LuM92Twm8?t=201 Mythbusters episode made in -2005-.\n\nhttp://www.dmv.org/articles/april-is-distracted-driving-month/\n\n\"You\u2019re 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive, and 3 times more likely to crash if you\u2019re doing something else, like eating, drinking, or adjusting the stereo.\"\n\nIf we said singing was only equally (probably worse than, though) as distracting as adjusting a stereo occasionally, and I said that you singing while driving created a modifier to your chances of crashing your car (this means both you and others have their lives and well being put in peril) of only 300%, would that change your mind on the behavior?\n\n>is it really all that different if the accompanying music is live? \n\nTo directly answer your question, I suspect that what you saw was far more distracting than just singing to a song playing on the radio.  Both activities are surely extremely distracting, but I am sure the driver in this video was more distracted in contrast.\n\nThe short of this is, ask yourself if you'd listen to music and sing along with it while reading a book.  I'd honestly bet money no human could do this without a persons ability to perform either task being negatively effected.  Just the same as singing a song surely negatively effects your ability to safely drive and trying to perform a song is even more of a distraction.\n\nTo me, what you see in this video is basically intoxicated driving, it's an extremely terrible activity and one day distracted driving may be treated as such.", "id": "d51pbp9"}], [{"comment": "Is the dude in the way back playing anything?  this is sweet.\n", "id": "d50y8wi"}, {"comment": "I think he's percussing.

", "id": "d5bcbn1"}, {"comment": "I'll have to note that I'm not an absolute authority on this, but I was listening to a LOT of music when Vaporwave first started making the rounds and I'm very interested in it artistically. So there may be some inaccuracies, but hopefully not.\n\nThis is probably a really messy read, and I only said maybe half of what I wanted to say. so sorry if it's dumb and bad lol\n\nWell, like i said, it's not exactly clear-cut. Vaporwave is not a genre in the traditional way. No genres are exact and are only used for classification, and are subjective, but in general I can tell you what is and isn't a jazz or metal song.\n\nVaporwave, however, is more difficult to pin down. The easy answer I can give is that vaporwave in general doesn't have added beats* and is slower and less uptempo. The real answer is more complicated. \n\nChuck Person's (Daniel Lopatin) Eccojams Vol. 1 is considered to be the first Vaporwave release, or at least some kind of proto-vaporwave. It was made up entirely of slowed down and chopped up samples of 80's music. It is more ambient music than anything else, really.\n\nWhether or not it was intended, it was seen by some as a parody or satire of consumerism, capitalism and technology. From here, other artists started doing similar things, many of them more explicitly parodying capitalism, pop music and pop culture in general**. This is often done through taking what are considered \"thrash\" or \"bad\" genres like smooth jazz, lounge and music from commercials, which I guess are in general intended to represent commercialism and capitalism, and twisting and deforming them. \n\nA lot of Vaporwave uses nostalgia to strong effect, evoking the technology (MIDI-type sounds for instance) of the early computing era and pop/contemporary music of the 80's. Just in general Vaporwave is HEAVILY sample-based***, even more so than Hip Hop, sometimes taking whole swaths of songs and basically just looping and chopping them, often without adding any original material. It is usually very downtempo and draws from ambient music more than anything else.\n\nAs Vaporwave took off, other genres started co-opting elements from it. A lot of hip hop and house producers sprang up, taking the smooth jazz samples and cheap sounds of vaporwave and adding the drums and production techniques of hip hop music. Examples are producers like Yung Bae, Saint Pepsi, Lazerhawk etc. I would not consider these \"true\" vaporwave, as they almost completely abandon the elements of satire and and nostalgia (I do like this music a lot though).\n\nFor this song, I'd argue it sprang partially from that type of music, combined with trap.\n\n\n*the \"sample + 808-drums\"-dichotomy (lol check out my pretentious vocab) pretty much puts this solidly in the hip hop subgenre of trap\n\n**A lot of Vaporwave is a sort of parody of an imaginary hyper-capitalist utopia, where corporations rule the world and you'll hear cheap sounding mall music everywhere. this is at least how i read a lot of it, although it might be subjective, and not nearly all of it follows this theme of course.\n\n***there's lots of exceptions to this of course. as an example, personally I'd consider James Ferraros \"Far Side Virtual\" vaporwave, but it is completely original compositions made with cheap sounding soundfonts. Also ", "id": "d5bvab1"}, {"comment": "Yea this is definitely more hip-hop inspired than regular vaporwave.

There's a remix of this on the FM-84 album that includes this song that OP posted.\n\nAlso, check out [Makeup and Vanity Set](http://makeupandvanityset.bandcamp.com/), as well as College and Electric Youth, both of whom are on the Drive soundtrack.\n\nMore mainstream would be M83, but please for the love of god ignore their most recent album \"junk.\"", "id": "d3cuaul"}, {"comment": "Thanks,\n\nA question.....if /r/outrun is about synthwave (so it seems) so why is it called \"outrun\"?\n\nI actually recently saw a movie that had \"M83 - Midnight City\" in it and fell in love with the track, seems like I've gravitated towards synthpop without even knowing it..", "id": "d3cuvon"}, {"comment": "It's called \"outrun\" because of [the Kavinsky album \"Outrun\"](https://kavinsky.bandcamp.com/album/outrun) released in 2013, on the heels of his inclusion in the soundtrack for the film \"Drive\" when the genre started to get some traction.\n\nIn my opinion, \"outrun\" is the more appropriate term, as synthwave captures the much more mellow synth sounds from the 80's.  That's why, for example, the subreddit /r/synthwave actually includes songs and artists from the 80s.  This newer stuff (FM-84, Compilerbau, Timecop1983, MAVS, but also the darker edgier Perturbator, Megadrive, Powerglove etc.) isn't from the 80's, it's recorded now.  A more generic term than outrun is \"futuresynth\", hence  /r/futuresynth.\n\nThe term outrun also applies to the vector neon/cyan-magenta aesthetic generally, e.g. [\"this poster is very outrun\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/outrun/comments/4iv9lg/n_o_f_u_t_u_r_e_%E6%9C%AA_%E6%9D%A5_%E3%81%8C_%E3%81%AA_%E3%81%84_oc_by_cody_vondell/)\n\nSo in sum, the best way to explore this stuff on reddit is /r/outrun+futuresynth .\n\nIf you like Midnight City, you should absolutely check out M83's back catalog, especially \"Before the Dawn Heals Us.\"", "id": "d3cvecc"}, {"comment": "The genre is inspired by the arcade game Outrun, and the soundtrack for that inspired a lot of the music of the genre.

He released \"Better Love\" as part of the soundtrack to the new Tarzan movie, and I really like it.\n\n**\"Travelling\" by Paper Lions** - I really like this song. The Paper Lions aren't very popular, but their sound is very genuine and I really like the lyrics to this song. Definitely a happy song, and worth a listen.\n\n**\"Soundcheck\" by Catfish and the Bottlemen** - I recently drove two states away to see these guys in concert. They've developed an underground cult following, and they're very solid. I would recommend Homesick and Kathleen to someone who's never listened to them.\n\n**\"Drop the Game\" by Flume** - My all-time favorite song.\n\n**\"Zoom\" by the Last Dinosaurs** - These guys are a niche indie band from Australia. I was recommended them by a friend, and I would recommend the heck out of them going forward.\n\nAny of these songs can be listened to on repeat, and all of them are very solid songs.

Livingstone's first record was released without his knowledge - a tenant in the building where he and a friend jammed recorded some of these sessions and released some tracks on the Planetone record label. When London-based Carnival Records were seeking a Jamaican vocal duo, Livingstone filled the requirement by double-tracking his own voice, releasing records in this fashion under the name 'Sugar & Dandy'. One of these singles, \"What a Life\", sold 25,000 copies, providing Livingstone with his first hit. When called on to perform live, Roy Smith was recruited to make up the duo, although he would be replaced by Tito \"Sugar\" Simon.\n\n> In 1967, Livingstone signed with Ska Beat Records, for whom he recorded his debut album 1968's Rocksteady with Dandy.\n\n> In 1968 Livingstone moved into production, and formed a duo with Audrey Hall (as 'Dandy & Audrey'). His production of other artists included The Marvels' debut album, and hit singles by Nicky Thomas (\"Suzanne Beware of The Devil\") and Tony Tribe (\"Red Red Wine\").\n\n> In the late 1960s, Livingstone worked with the trombonist, Rico Rodriguez, who had featured on \"Rudy, A Message to You\". Rodriguez later played with The Specials, whose 1979 cover version of the song made it famous. Livingstone produced several singles for Rodriguez under the name 'Rico & the Rudies'.\n\n> Livingstone signed to Trojan Records in 1968, releasing two albums, Follow That Donkey and Dandy Returns. A Trojan subsidiary, Down Town Records, was set up to release Livingstone's output, both as a singer and producer, the J-Dan subsidiary serving the same purpose in the early 1970s. In the early 1970s, Livingstone returned to Jamaica, living there until 1973.\n\n> Livingstone resurfaced in 1973 with the \"Black Star\" single on Mooncrest Records, and the album Conscious. On his return to the UK, he recorded a self-titled album at Byron Lee's studio.\n\n> The 2 Tone movement in Britain of the late 1970s brought Livingstone to a new audience.\n\n> \n\n> Dandy is one of the great unsung heroes of the early British Reggae scene. \n\n> In 1963 he chanced to meet Lee Gopthal, who later founded Trojan Records, and soon began working in the record shop Gopthal owned. 'Dandy' - a natty dresser - heard that a local record company was keen to sign up a Jamaican duo. So as not to miss the chance, the enterprising would-be singer double-tracked his voice. He then offered the recording to the record company as the debut of a new male duo he called \"Sugar and Dandy\".\n\n> The Sugar & Dandy name continued to appear on various UK-based labels, first for Carnival, then for Ska Beat. In time, Dandy recruited a second singer to take on the \"Sugar\" role - Roy Smith. He was soon replaced by Keith Foster. When the duo finally split, Foster worked solo under the alias Sugar Simone, and went on to enjoy some success in the early seventies as Tito Simon.\n\n> In the meantime, Dandy went from strength to strength as a solo act, writing, performing and producing his own material. His 1967 classic, Rudy - A Message to You was affectionately revived by the Specials in 1979 in the midst of the UK Ska revival.\n\n> In 1968 Lee Gopthal was rebuilding his Trojan label, following his split from Island Records. He offered Dandy - his proteg\u00e9 - a remarkable deal, signing him as both artist and in-house producer. Seven of the first ten singles issued on the 'new' Trojan label were Dandy (or 'Brother Dan') productions. When Trojan licensed more Jamaican-sourced material, the Downtown label was set up later that year, specifically for the British recordings.\n\n> Working in London, Dandy was prolific, both as artist and producer. He used the best Jamaican musicians available locally, such as veteran trombonist Rico Rodrigues, and proved it was possible to create Reggae music outside of Jamaica. Chalk Farm Studios in London provided the recording facilities, and hardly anyone noticed the records were 'home-grown'.\n\n> In 1969 Dandy's schedule was as productive as it was hectic. \"I'm Your Puppet\" he sang on a cover version of the James & Bobby Purify Soul hit, but he was nothing of the sort. Dandy was in total control. He discovered girl singer Audrey Hall, fronted Rico Rodrigues with the Rudies, and his production of Tony Tribe's Red Red Wine was the inspiration for UB40's later cover version. (Although the song was originally recorded by its composer Neil Diamond, it was first popularised in England by Jamaican-born Jimmy James.) Dandy almost achieved a hit himself, with the classic Reggae in Your Jeggae. Though it made no impact on the Top 40, the track was popular enough to be included on Trojan's Reggae Chartbusters album the following year.\n\n> By the early seventies Dandy was becoming tired, disillusioned and losing direction. He relocated to Jamaica in 1971 to - as he described it, \"recharge (his) musical batteries\". A year later, refreshed and full of new ideas he hired Byron Lee's Dynamic studios and cut some new material. With the master tapes under his arm he returned to London and presented Trojan with a new album and a new identity. Dandy 'Your Musical Doctor' was no more. Enter Dandy Livingstone.\n\n> Despite finally achieving chart success in 1972, with Suzanne Beware of the Devil and Big City, Dandy's sudden high profile proved to be short-lived. His \"Conscious\" album was greeted with warm reviews, but wasn't a chart-topper. Also, the Reggae scene was changing, and Trojan's dominance in the market place was dwindling. The label's finances were on the rocks, and in 1974 he decided to leave the sinking ship. The label folded not long afterwards. Dandy - for many years a mainstay of British Reggae scene - simply vanished from sight.\n\n> With the chart success of his \"Dandy Livingstone\" sides, he found himself busier than ever, but now with interviews, TV appearances and media curiosity about the latest Jamaican 'pop star'. But, behind the scenes, decisions were being made that took him by surprise. His album was shuffled off the main Trojan label onto Mooncrest - better known for its Folk and Rock releases. By the time he found out about it, the deal was done. Dandy Livingstone was apparently no longer a \"Trojan\" artist. In retrospect, this probably wasn't the best idea for a singer identified with Reggae, and may have relegated the album to the bargain bins.\n\n> As the seventies progressed, he decided he'd simply had enough of the musical rat-race, and after cutting a couple of Doo Wop tunes on his own label, more for his own pleasure than anything - he kind of disappeared. By the time Reggae fans began wondering, \"whatever happened to Dandy...?\" he didn't seem to be around any more. The truth was, after 25 years in London, he'd packed his things, said farewell the cold climate of Britain, and in February 1983 he headed back to the sunnier shores of Jamaica.\n\n> In more recent times, he has been involved in a crafts distribution outfit - actually his wife's concern - but happily, the call of music has proved too strong to let him 'retire' forever. In mid-2002, Trojan Records announced plans to release a \"Best Of Dandy Livingstone\" compilation, which would mark the first-ever CD release of his classic recordings. As soon as I heard the news, I mailed him. He was naturally delighted to hear about it. And, there's more...\n\n> Early 2003 saw Mr Thompson putting the finishing touches to his latest project. With an energy typical of the man, he's not just preparing an album - but TWO!

Then he starts getting involved in a vaporwave community on SPF420. Then people start following him on social media and his sound cloud listens go through the roof.\n\nHe drops out.\n\nThen come the interviews on tiny mixtapes and the like and to his eventual signing with CarPark. I will never forget seeing that contract with his signature. We were all so fucking proud of him and still are. \n\nGuy is a genius, I could never see him doing anything but making music.

In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite then a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi\u2019s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. \nOver the next year Kamasi\u2019s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi\u2019s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi\u2019s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d. \nThis fiery group of \u201cYoung Giants\u201d wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson\u2019s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album \u201cIn My Time\u201d which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi\u2019s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called \u201cBird Man Records\u201d heard him playing with \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the \u201cbig break\u201d for \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after it\u2019s completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay \u201cready and waiting\u201d for too long, thus \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d unofficially disbanded. Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called \u201cThe Next Step\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking.

In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite then a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi\u2019s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. \nOver the next year Kamasi\u2019s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi\u2019s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi\u2019s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d. \nThis fiery group of \u201cYoung Giants\u201d wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson\u2019s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album \u201cIn My Time\u201d which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi\u2019s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called \u201cBird Man Records\u201d heard him playing with \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the \u201cbig break\u201d for \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after it\u2019s completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay \u201cready and waiting\u201d for too long, thus \u201cThe Young Jazz Giants\u201d unofficially disbanded. Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called \u201cThe Next Step\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking.

If someone is incredibly talentless, yet makes a number 1 hit, it does not matter whether they have sung the song themselves, or whether they've written it, many great writers get other people to sing their song, the only objective of music is for other people to enjoy it. 1/4 of the Beatles could read sheet music and most of their songs were written with 3 chords.

It is commonly used with reference to Heavy metal guitar playing, where it is associated with rapid tapping solos, fast scale and arpeggio runs and special effects such as whammy bar \"dive bombs\". Metal guitarists playing in a \"shred\" style use the electric guitar with a guitar amplifier and a range of electronic effects such as distortion, which create a more sustained guitar tone and facilitate guitar feedback effects. The term is sometimes used with reference to virtuoso playing outside the metal idiom, particularly in bluegrass and jazz fusion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shred_guitar)  \n  \nWhile there is some debate, shredding is certainly done across lots of genres, and has more to do with the style of play than anything else.

His mother was half-Japanese, and his Japanese grandmother got him interested in enka music from a young age. He first went to Japan at age 15 to participate in a Japanese language speech contest. In high school he was captain on the dance team. He enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in information science, and graduated in 2003. During this time, he went on a three month exchange to a university in Kansai, and during his stay was when he decided he would become an enka singer.\n\n> After graduating, he returned to Japan and worked as a teacher at an eikaiwa school in Wakayama-ken, as well as being a computer engineer in Osaka. In his spare time he appeared on NHK singing programs, and entered many karaoke competitions and winning an array of awards. In particular, he entered a karaoke competition sponsored by Sakamoto Fuyumi and won first place, which is what caught the eye of Victor and got him scouted. He practiced for two years, and finally in February 2008 debuted with the single Umiyuki.\n\n> In contrast to his music JERO usually maintains the outward appearance of a hip-hop artist.

In high school he was captain on the dance team. He enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in information science, and graduated in 2003. During this time, he went on a three month exchange to a university in Kansai, and during his stay was when he decided he would become an enka singer.\n\n> After graduating, he returned to Japan and worked as a teacher at an eikaiwa school in Wakayama-ken, as well as being a computer engineer in Osaka. In his spare time he appeared on NHK singing programs, and entered many karaoke competitions and winning an array of awards. In particular, he entered a karaoke competition sponsored by Sakamoto Fuyumi and won first place, which is what caught the eye of Victor and got him scouted. He practiced for two years, and finally in February 2008 debuted with the single Umiyuki.\n\n> In contrast to his music JERO usually maintains the outward appearance of a hip-hop artist.

There is another world hidden between the cracks of that which you know. In this world, there is a man that you will not find in any history books or credit reports. He cannot be seen with the human eye at \"the mall\" or \"the club\". He is known only as Richie Cunning and there are very few people that even know of his existence. Countless believers have reported first-hand sightings, claiming to have seen him drinking from a flask on a bus station bench in the middle of the night or even fast asleep on a bus station bench in the middle of the night. However, gentlemen and scholars both maintain that he is nothing more than a myth. A drunken ghost in the collective subconscious of modern society. Many have tried to understand him, but there is only one way to truly understand that which is Richie Cunning. You must leave your world behind and step into his realm....a place thought to exist only in fairy tales and ugly areas of downtown San Francisco. Your journey begins now.\nHere there are many people just like you, except that they don't wear those fashionable little pants you have on or those \"hot\" sneakers that you picked up on sale at an urban boutique. In your pockets are nothing but a pint of E & J and an expired bus pass. The cracked pavement on which you stand is littered with hand-rolled cigarette butts, losing lottery scratchers, and murky puddles of city juice that faintly reflect the half-illuminated neon lights of forgotten bars and liquor stores that you are not welcome in. The dark sky above you is blanketed in an ominous fog so suffocatingly thick that God himself knows not what happens here. Hollow gusts of wind echo through the streets with a voice so human that they seem to whisper in your ear, \"give me your shoes....or I will open you up with this piece of broken glass\". The cold night air is ripe with the aromatically intoxicating scent of long-neglected plumbing problems, bus exhaust, and the most luxurious of transvestite perfume. What is this place? You ask. How did I get here and why should I care who this guy is or where he comes from? It's a mystery. And that's why so is Richie Cunning.  \n Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/Richie+Cunning): 7,511 listeners, 87,237 plays  \n tags: *Hip-Hop, underground hip-hop, underground rap, West Coast Rap*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0."], [6, "This guy looks so familiar"], [7, "That beat is dope"], [7, "Found this song recently on my Spotify Discover Weekly.

Etc. My favorite hip-hop is stuff that's got a big epic orchestra-sounding drive behind it. Strings/piano or tribal drums for that thick wall-of-sound orchestra beat is a bonus. Old-school samples are fun if they're used correctly, and sometimes it's nice to have some relatable lyrics in between all the generic stuff about power and money that saturates the genre a lot of times.", "id": "d9oyciv"}, {"comment": "Do you have a Spotify playlist I could follow?

There is another world hidden between the cracks of that which you know. In this world, there is a man that you will not find in any history books or credit reports. He cannot be seen with the human eye at \"the mall\" or \"the club\". He is known only as Richie Cunning and there are very few people that even know of his existence. Countless believers have reported first-hand sightings, claiming to have seen him drinking from a flask on a bus station bench in the middle of the night or even fast asleep on a bus station bench in the middle of the night. However, gentlemen and scholars both maintain that he is nothing more than a myth. A drunken ghost in the collective subconscious of modern society. Many have tried to understand him, but there is only one way to truly understand that which is Richie Cunning. You must leave your world behind and step into his realm....a place thought to exist only in fairy tales and ugly areas of downtown San Francisco. Your journey begins now.\nHere there are many people just like you, except that they don't wear those fashionable little pants you have on or those \"hot\" sneakers that you picked up on sale at an urban boutique. In your pockets are nothing but a pint of E & J and an expired bus pass. The cracked pavement on which you stand is littered with hand-rolled cigarette butts, losing lottery scratchers, and murky puddles of city juice that faintly reflect the half-illuminated neon lights of forgotten bars and liquor stores that you are not welcome in. The dark sky above you is blanketed in an ominous fog so suffocatingly thick that God himself knows not what happens here. Hollow gusts of wind echo through the streets with a voice so human that they seem to whisper in your ear, \"give me your shoes....or I will open you up with this piece of broken glass\". The cold night air is ripe with the aromatically intoxicating scent of long-neglected plumbing problems, bus exhaust, and the most luxurious of transvestite perfume. What is this place? You ask. How did I get here and why should I care who this guy is or where he comes from? It's a mystery. And that's why so is Richie Cunning.  \n Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/Richie+Cunning): 7,511 listeners, 87,237 plays  \n tags: *Hip-Hop, underground hip-hop, underground rap, West Coast Rap*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0.", "id": "d9o8wyk"}, {"comment": "> Read more on Last.fm.\n\nNo thanks.", "id": "d9oj1cb"}], [{"comment": "This guy looks so familiar", "id": "d9ofmus"}, {"comment": "He looks like a young Jean Reno, in my opinion.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vnaqRSF.png", "id": "d9p6k6r"}], [{"comment": "That beat is dope", "id": "d9orzwo"}, {"comment": "He produces all his own music.", "id": "d9p66vh"}], [{"comment": "Found this song recently on my Spotify Discover Weekly.

They are definitely balls to the wall.\n\nI guess my answer is sort of long and extraneous, but here we go.\n\n\"The Monitor\" came out when I was a freshman in high school, but I didn't get into it until I was a sophomore. It did everything I could have wanted. It had nearly perfect lyrics, direct historical references to a fascinating part of American history, great guitar solos and bagpipe solos and horn solos, other big names in current rock were reading quotes from the Civil War--Craig Finn does Walt Whitman which I just love.--and it was all wrapped around this giant metaphor for Stickle's depression. As some pissed off angsty teen it was perfect, and it's aged so well. Typically the things that you loved as a kid start to become stale as you grow older, but that hasn't happened with Titus. Now I'm 22 and I'm about to start my senior year of college. I still listen to Titus. I still blast \"The Monitor\" and I'm sure my friends have gotten bored with me ranting about them. But that's avoiding the question.\n\n\"Local Business\" came out when I was a senior in high school. I got it on release day and really enjoyed it, but didn't love it. Initially I was shocked by how obviously depressing it was. \"The Monitor\" makes you think about it all, using the Civil War as a representation about how he's battling himself just like how America was at war with itself, and he keeps blaming some enemy. \"The enemy is everywhere\" is shouted throughout the album, but he ultimately comes to the conclusion that he is his own worst enemy. In \"Battle of Hampton Roads\" he starts listing how he'll destroy himself with his drinking and smoking and screaming. It's enough to write a dissertation on, in fact I wrote a paper on it for a Civil War literature class. But I digress. \n\n\"Local Business\" hits you immediately with his exact thoughts. \"Okay I think by now we have established everything is inherently worthless, and there's nothing in the universe with any kind of objective purpose.\" This is no metaphor, no painted picture, no giant concept. It's a thesis statement. It's what he believes. That entire song is his thoughts on the world he's observed and he ends it by describing himself \"Look at this youngish man...\" The song is called Ecce Homo, which means \"Behold the Man.\" It's like he's presenting himself. As the album goes on he's singing about all the things he's seen, car crashes, his eating disorder, being electrically shocked. It's all weird stuff that's happened to him. It's--not to sound corny--local business. The more I listen to it the more I love it because it can be played when I'm relaxing in my bed, when I'm driving, when I want to pump myself up, and when I'm having a simple conversation. I love everything about it, I think it's because each song is its own little project whereas in \"The Monitor\" and in \"The Most Lamentable Tragedy\" everything is interconnected, which is fucking awesome, but I'm not always looking for a giant concept. I'm looking for music that's authentic, and I think \"Local Business\" is exactly that. It's raw. It's rock music that wants to be rock music, it isn't trying to push the boundaries and redefine the genre. \"Local Business\" is trying to give you good guitar solos and loud lyrics.\n\nI guess that's my reasoning to why I love \"Local Business\" the most, but realistically that could all change in a few years. All four of their albums rock.\n\nSorry for the intensive analytical response. I know you didn't ask for it.\n\nMaybe you already knew all of that.\n\nMaybe you didn't.\n\nMaybe it's Maybelline.

They didn't hop freight trains. They did like to drink forties by the train tracks where the police wouldn't bother them. Most shows were a solo acoustic performance, but the full band at various times included Flash-C (trumpet), Ian Skumfuck (washtub bass), Jeff-face (harmonica), Roman (bicycle), Michael Jordan (drums), & Wyatt (harmonica).\n\n> The last show was in 2007. There is no source to order physical copies of Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains music, but a variety of online torrents and other pirated sources are available. The band has given full support to pirating Johnny Hobo music, and any other music you want.\n\n> Lead songwriter Pat \"The Bunny\" (Pat Schneeweis) went on to play similar music with less destructive lyrical content in Wingnut Dishwashers Union, until entering rehab for drug addiction in late 2009.  After getting out of the year-long rehab program, Schneeweis provided vocals, lyrics and guitar for the Tucson-based folk-punk  band Ramshackle Glory before leaving the band and anarcho-punk scene.

They didn't hop freight trains. They did like to drink forties by the train tracks where the police wouldn't bother them. Most shows were a solo acoustic performance, but the full band at various times included Flash-C (trumpet), Ian Skumfuck (washtub bass), Jeff-face (harmonica), Roman (bicycle), Michael Jordan (drums), & Wyatt (harmonica).\n\n> The last show was in 2007. There is no source to order physical copies of Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains music, but a variety of online torrents and other pirated sources are available. The band has given full support to pirating Johnny Hobo music, and any other music you want.\n\n> Lead songwriter Pat \"The Bunny\" (Pat Schneeweis) went on to play similar music with less destructive lyrical content in Wingnut Dishwashers Union, until entering rehab for drug addiction in late 2009.  After getting out of the year-long rehab program, Schneeweis provided vocals, lyrics and guitar for the Tucson-based folk-punk  band Ramshackle Glory before leaving the band and anarcho-punk scene.
