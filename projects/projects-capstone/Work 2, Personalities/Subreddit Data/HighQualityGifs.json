I was browsing suggestions for movies to watch, and saw this film suggested.\n\nJust the mention of it brought up this scene in my head, and I realized how similar it was to [another scene](https://gfycat.com/FarPowerlessAmericancrow) I had success giffing. So it was kind of a sequel.\n\nI don't use a notepad, but that's basically the process. Sometimes I watch a film/video/whatever searching for something, but most of the time I notice it without searching. Potential upvote gifs or reaction gifs are the easiest to spot. It's something being hit, or flung, or placed, or someone making a silly face. Ideally, combinations of those. Gifs can't rely on dialogue, they have to have big expressions or movement.\n\nThe process for this one went roughly like this:\n\n1. Watch a few times, consider what \"lines\" can be easily swapped out. I had most of the 2nd half figured out even before I watched the clip. Just based on memory of the scene. I simply replaced certain terms with reddit themed ones. It's not the most sophisticated form of humor, but that's ok.\n\n2. Load up the entire clip into Premiere. Watch it a few times to determine a good start and end point. Other gifs may have more trimming, but this was just in and out points.\n\n3. Send to After Effects. Start captioning the lines you know. Work towards the parts you don't know yet. For me, this was the 1st half. Go back and watch the original clip as needed. I probably played each line 3+ times to come up with my version, and a few more to get the timings right.\n\n4. When there's a bit that isn't working, decide if you can cut it, or come back to it later. There's actually a line after \"[...]taken from the front page of 9gag!\" in the original clip, but I trimmed it out because it was distracting, and not entertaining. The last exchange I figured out was actually the first, the one about gilding. I put it off until I had finished the rest.\n\n5. Do a \"spice it up\" pass to improve the visuals a bit. This is when I added the rotating text, purely because I was bored with a plain captioned gif. Sometimes I add tracking, dickbutts, etc.\n\nIt's probably more than you wanted, but I wrote up [a post about how I make gifs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HarrisHoffman/comments/4e0dtc/how_i_make_gifs_part_2_creative_considerations/) I'd be remiss if I didn't link it.", "id": "d2xcyq2"}, {"comment": "Holy crap, I wasn't expecting to get such a detailed answer.

Ermey got the role. \n\nStanley Kubrick had nothing but praise for R. Lee Ermey's skills as a performer. Kubrick originally was going to write dialogue for Ermey's character himself, but he became so impressed with what Ermey improvised, that he decided it wasn't necessary. He just let him ad-lib, something practically unheard of for a Stanley Kubrick film. Ermey's performances were so faultless that Kubrick only needed 2-3 takes to get his scenes filmed, also extremely rare for a Kubrick film.

So a lot of investors are re-evaluating British prospects, and the sterling is dropping as a result. Which means the neo-liberal economic policy followed by the UK for the past 40 years will trigger more austerity measures for the British people (i.e. tax cuts for the rich and businesses and reduced public spending followed by tax raises for the poor and middle classes).\n\nThen you have to consider the 4 million British people estimated to live in Europe or retain property that they regularly visit. They'd have to go through the process of acquiring a visa to remain in those countries or keep visiting them, or a passport from those countries. Which might not be so easy, considering most of them are retired and not eligible for work.\n\nThen there's all the non-UK EU citizens that work or study in the UK. While they've been promised that they'd be automatically granted visas to remain indefinitely within the UK, it does complicate their relationships to their employers and universities. Particularly students will see their tuition fees triple (at minimum) since the universities will no longer be bound to keep the same tuition fees for EU citizens as for UK citizens. And universities are a big part of the UK economy, not only in income from tuition fees, but also for whatever the students spend for accommodation and living expenses, which is usually money that are directly injected into the UK economy from foreign countries.

I've already seen it, I downvote it and move on having already seen it. The other 99% have not, however, and they upvote it. Their votes far overshadow my vote. No harm done, everyone who hasn't seen the post gets to see it. Yes, there is truth that if I'm browsing /r/new (I don't) and initially downvote something I've seen, it could undermine a post right from the start, but not so for posts that have already gain some traction.\n\nConsider the reverse case. Someone makes a post, 99% of people have seen it, I have not. It gets 99 downvotes against my one potential upvote. It's likely that I won't even see the vote initially. But too bad for me. Why should the 99% upvote a post that they had all seen just to make up for that potential one person who might not have seen it? It gets the point where if enough people have seen something and you just happen to be one of the select few who haven't seen it, then you're just unfortunate.\n\nYou responded that I was not considering the millions who can't/don't upvote/downvote because they don't have an account. I responded to hell with them because how are we supposed to implicitly *know* somehow what they have and have not seen. Why should we upvote posts that all the voting community has already seen? If non-account people care about the content they view, rather than being at the mercy of the voting community, they should make an account. I'm not going to vote in a way that benefits users that aren't including themselves in the voting process. They could have had their own say by making an account, but they didn't.

This is going to require beating at a lower speed and a longer time than most people are used to.  I would suggest starting with room temperature butter.\n\n* This is difficult to achieve with a hand mixer but basically, the butter/sugar mixture should stop sticking to itself and clumping and the beaters should be able to pass through it easily.\n\n3) Alternate Dry and Wet ingredients\n\n* Once the butter is properly creamed add your dry and wet ingredients in \"dumps\" starting and ending with your dry ingredients and taking no longer than about 30 seconds total to add them, it doesn't have to be well mixed at this point and your beaters should be on a low enough speed to not fling flour everywhere\n\n4) Once all ingredients have been added, beat on high for about 15 seconds to set up the batter's consistency\n\nAnd that's about it, this has been Baker's Corner with tonybaby, join us next week when we discuss the proper technique for smoking brisket and why post oak is the only proper wood to use.", "id": "d6r53sy"}], [{"comment": "Moist Kek <--This One\n\nMoist Kek\n\nMoist Kek\n\nMoist Kek\n\nMoist Kek", "id": "d6qmbnp"}], [{"comment": "Ha!

The machines would have come up with some other way to utilize the human as to continue to be used for the duration of their natural lifespan.\n\nUnless the people plugged into the Matrix that are controlled by the machines don't suffer such a fate and it's only restricted to the people jacking in from the outside.

You don't die from dreams nor from other simulated experiences. Your body is not just going to kill itself because your brain thinks it's dead, because what you logically think honestly doesn't matter to your body that much. You don't figure out that you should be dead and then die, you generally perceive yourself as alive up until the point that you physically die. Long-term psychosomatic damage, maybe. I could see things like phantom pain and other similar things we see in people today.\n\nMost likely, if it would happen, it would have needed to been coded on purpose in a rather specific way. I.e., if all experiences very explicitly simulate a lot of chemical processes. So robots did it to make humans weaker. But then the whole \"I have never opened my eyes\" sequence wouldn't make much sense, either.\n\nIt's a trope that is present in almost every case of simulation fiction, sadly. I think it's because writing simulation fiction without characters dying-when-they-die makes the simulated world less \"real\" and harder to write about in a typical fashion.

If you use this tool you can make a \"masked layer\" where the shape you make essentially cuts out everything that isn't within that shape.\n\nSay I have a picture with a face in it, I could select the picture and draw the mask around the face. When I connect it back to the beginning it'll crop down the picture so it's only the face. You can also set it to remove the face and only have the background, etc.\n\nSo here, OP has masked the bits the head goes behind, and has gone into tracker and kept pressing \"next frame\" until a mask has gone out of shape. Then they would alter the mask so it fit and repeat.\n\nAfter you have masked the section, put the masked layer at the top (like Bring to Front in MS Word) and then put the face below it. Then OP has got the original video file and put that underneath the face, so the face appears below the masked section and above the background.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: Oh gosh that's a lot of upvotes.\n\nEdit 2: Here's a bit more (with pictures and stuff! :D):\n\nSo this is the segment I want to mask: [Gfycat](https://gfycat.com/AltruisticAlertKagu). I open it up into After Effects and I use the pen tool to [draw a mask around the first frame](http://i.imgur.com/WjmKjD7.png) - and then [when I finish it'll cut out the rest.](\nhttps://gfycat.com/OldFrigidHen) Obviously this isn't very accurate I just did it quickly. Now we have this [masked version](http://i.imgur.com/QReiVGV.png) of the first frame.\n\n[Now, I duplicate (CTRL+D) the layer](\nhttps://gfycat.com/CookedIncomparableCaecilian) and remove the mask from the one on the bottom. [Finally, I add a text layer and put it in the middle. You can add a picture, another video, whatever. Thus, the text is below the disembodied head but is above the background walls and stuff.](https://gfycat.com/ShimmeringMeaslyBurro).\n\nNow, if you want you can go into the top video layer -> Masks -> [Your mask] and right click it, selecting \"Track Mask\". Here you can follow the mask for the whole scene not just one frame, but obviously it's easy to do as you will only need to alter a few points on the mask because AE is pretty good at working out where things are.\n\n**Note: This isn't the only way to mask things. There are plugins that do it more powerfully, and there's also a really scary tool called Roto-scape which does something that I have no way of understanding and so I barely ever use it for fear of being murdered by my own monitor.**", "id": "d4v2c28"}, {"comment": "a lot", "id": "d4v1kf9"}, {"comment": "Editing every single frame", "id": "d4v1udy"}, {"comment": "Bit of an odd oversimplification.

She listened very closely to the directions I gave her for caring for her new plant (it was a gorgeous plum & white blossom, & very hardy), & even had me write them down for her. I used store stationary & even wrote my name in the card & told her to come see me if she had any questions at all.\n\nAbout a month & a half later, an older man comes in with the orchid, possibly her father. He'd seen my name & the name of our store on the card & brought it back to us. The young woman had passed away in an accident shortly after moving, & he didn't know how to care for the plant. It was in great shape, I could tell she'd been taking good care of it, but he didn't want anything to do with it. He asked me to refund it & put it back on the shelves, as even with the directions he wasn't sure he could take care of it, & even if he could, he didn't want it around. I think it reminded him of her too much.\n\nI have a small amount of oversight in the department, so I managed to trade him the orchids for a funeral bouquet that was worth a lot more. I was supposed to put the orchid back on display, but I couldn't bear to. I got permission to bring it home with me, but even with all the care I gave it, it died a couple weeks later.\n\nI don't know if flowers can miss people, but part of me likes to think this one did."], [2, "Fat Rob McElhenney is my favorite thing on tv ever."], [2, "I'm gonna subscribe because of the implication"], [2, "And then reddit became great again"], [3, "I regret that I have but one upvote to give.

She was very excited about moving into a new home & had me help her find a flower that would brighten up the place. She listened very closely to the directions I gave her for caring for her new plant (it was a gorgeous plum & white blossom, & very hardy), & even had me write them down for her. I used store stationary & even wrote my name in the card & told her to come see me if she had any questions at all.\n\nAbout a month & a half later, an older man comes in with the orchid, possibly her father. He'd seen my name & the name of our store on the card & brought it back to us. The young woman had passed away in an accident shortly after moving, & he didn't know how to care for the plant. It was in great shape, I could tell she'd been taking good care of it, but he didn't want anything to do with it. He asked me to refund it & put it back on the shelves, as even with the directions he wasn't sure he could take care of it, & even if he could, he didn't want it around. I think it reminded him of her too much.\n\nI have a small amount of oversight in the department, so I managed to trade him the orchids for a funeral bouquet that was worth a lot more. I was supposed to put the orchid back on display, but I couldn't bear to.

They are so cringey and sad. Seasons 1-3 are the only real community. The reason Season 4 feels off to you is because they replaced the Show creator and lead writer Dan Harmon with some cheaper industry hacks. They wised up and brought Harmon back for seasons 5 and 6, but by that time they were losing key characters like Pierce (Chevy Chase) and Troy (Donald Glover). It never really recaptures the magic of season 1-3, which are imo some of the best examples of tv comedy ever put on air. The show just feels like an empty husk of itself desperately trying to recapture it's mojo by introducing new irrelevant characters and being overly meta. \n\nYou will hear many diehards say that 5 and 6 are just as good, but they are simply wrong.

Let's say about a minute long duration.", "id": "daj0cz4"}, {"comment": "Okay, my first gif was over a minute. And that was bare bones learning. Probably took 6 hours. 1 to layout what I wanted it to be, 3-4 googling how to do a specific idea one after another. It had motion tracking and basic masking, so that needed to be learned. probably of that 3-4 hours half was watching videos and reading, half was doing. And then the last hour was getting it to properly export which was a huge pain because it was 1500 frames. \n\nFor reference this one is just shy of 2000 frames but it's 30fps. But this time I knew how to handle the export. With this one again I had to learn other effects, which is why I make new ones. I wanted to really know some text effects so I played with those for a while, using pre-stock and creating my own I wanted heavy dialogue. And I even had to cut 30 seconds from the source that I wanted. I needed to learn how to use the emitter with custom images, and play with how it looked. The emitter took the most time, like 3 hours or more spread over a couple days until I *settled* on having wasted enough time. \n\nI ran into a HUGE problem with a still frame from that scene playing on top of everything before it, super corrupted everything. I had to start over in some aspects and re-time the first half, that was a wasted whole day. Then abandoned the re-work and almost abandoned the gif entire. Thought \"wtf am I doing here, I can't do this.\" quite a few times. \n\nEven now it's held together with duck tape, there's bits of the scene that just wouldn't fix that glitch so I took quick clips from the source video on a new layer to \"patch\" those parts. So hours or so just spent timing layers to be the same.\n\nAlso the bottles.... I tried to make myself learn more about different ways to track. I tried corner pinning. it was glitchy looking. Ended up going frame by frame on scale and position anyway, took like 4 hours and did masking on the left bottle. Then I go to open the project later, and they ALL glitch.. Wtf happened. I fix them over an hour. Go one to finish the gif, and what do I see but the bottles don't move correctly AGAIN. Meanwhile half the time the rotoscope would stop working on a frame and I had to redo it. So I say fuck it, I'll finish the gif and do them last so I know they'll work and render quick. And that's what I did and even THEN, some of them glitch but only when rendering, stepping frame by frame they were perfect. \n\nSo that's a long way of saying, 5 to 6 hours because I'm also learning. This one in *particular* probably double that. I imagine when I'm not trying a *new* effect it'll be fast. But also I hope I don't run out of getting to use new aspects of AE for a while. \n\nSorry for the long answer to your quick question lol", "id": "daj0y5q"}, {"comment": "I'm actually amazed you gave me such a well put together answer.

[With about 1.5s of driver reaction time and additional braking time that's about 72 feet of distance covered city or 144 feet of distance covered country](http://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/reactiontime.html) before a driver seeing the pedestrian can be reliably expected to begin effective braking.\n\nFor other cases clearly distracted driving plays a roll. I get to 5 seconds of time stationary in traffic for the first three impacts in the super cut but the mean girls one is only 3, much more believable. Then we get one more 5 second stationary and the next 4 are all 3 seconds or less of stationary in traffic.\n\nThere's some variability to when breaks or horn are engaged before or after impact. Obviously cases where a horn or break sound start before impact are the most believable.", "id": "d1j6pxx"}, {"comment": "[Here is a list of the clips in the video](http://www.pajiba.com/guides/hit-by-a-bus-a-supercut-by-harry-hanrahan.php)", "id": "d1ja4it"}, {"comment": "They pay attention, just not to the streets.

It should be cheaper now, and it's still got a decent online community. Alternatively, if you want a challenge (or have a wii u for online functionality), go for 3 ultimate. It's older, and doesn't have as many QoL improvements, but it's my personal favorite from the series. A lot of people don't like the underwater combat, but it's not as bad as people like to say it is. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit! Also, the monster roster is by far my favorite of the series.\n\nGenerations is pretty cool too, but it's definitely not the classic monster hunter game. It's a lot flashier, and it has special moves that are a big change from older generations. It's also mostly a game full of references to the older generations, so a lot of the references will go over a newcomer's head. That being said, it's pretty newbie friendly, and it's somewhat easier than previous games.\n\nAs for how the games play, the best comparison I can make is specifically boss fights in dark souls. You have to be somewhat patient, notice attack patterns, and use the gaps to your advantage. There are a ton of weapon types, and each one utilizes different strategies. The main differences are the fact that you can't just dodge through everything (there are a lot less Invincibility frames than in dark souls), and there is no health bar on the monsters. You have to use your own judgement to determine how close to death they are, and they give hints through broken parts and limping.\n\nIf you do decide to get 4u or generations, let me know!

It's been 150 years since then, and Hollywood still hasn't gotten the memo. At least glock 17s are safe guns, it's especially bad when they depict old Western revolvers being used that way.\n\nThe wiki talks about it:\n\n\n>Paul Wellman notes that clubbing an opponent with the butt of a gun held by its barrel, as seen in some Westerns, is problematic. First, guns are designed for shooting, not as a club. Second, the danger of an unintentional discharge could fatally wound the \"clubber\". Additionally, many handguns, specifically revolvers, lack sufficient structural strength (particularly black powder cap and ball era revolvers). Striking a target in this manner could cause damage to the weapon. Finally, rotating a gun so that it can be held by its barrel takes extra time. The loss of time may be crucial during a fight. Instead, pistol-whipping should be done with the gun held in an ordinary manner, hitting the target with an overhand strike from either the long, heavy barrel of the gun or the side of the gun in the area of the cylinder. It was a fairly common way to incapacitate a man (assisted by the heavy weight of the handguns of the day), and was known as \"buffaloing\", with the verb form being \"to buffalo\".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol-whipping", "id": "dait0rw"}, {"comment": "No idea, but in a practical sense, I imagine it'd be better to slap someone holding a pistol normally.

If they suck I'll return them.\n\nEdit: Just got them. The **JAM Transit Wireless Headphones HX-HP420BK** from best buy. I was able to use an online \"on sale\" price of $28 in store. After taxes it was $30. I really like them! The sound quality is what I'd hope for in a pair of ear buds. I read one review that said the sound was \"muddy\" but I don't get that at all, and I consider myself a bit of an audiophile. Sound quality is the most important part of any headphones for me, and the quality of these are definitely sufficient. The highs and mids are clear, the bass is present. I'm surprised at their sound canceling ability too. The rubber part that goes into your ear does a good job at canceling out sound. These will be great for mowing the lawn. The package includes 5 different sets of these rubber inserts to choose from, I was surprised by that. The ear clips are nice too, although I don't really need them. Perhaps if I was moving around more quickly they would come in handy. The headphones are light enough that they don't seem to have any problem holding themselves in your ear. \n\nMy only complaint is probably the charger port. The little door to it is plastic, and I can tell it's inevitably going to break someday. It's held in by a tiny piece of plastic rod - that is the part that will probably snap some day. The only reason I could see that being an actual problem is because the charging port is on the top of the headphone, so if I'm sweating, some of that sweat might actually drop right into the exposed charger port. I hope the plastic door doesn't break off. I'll have to be really careful with it.", "id": "d6rv5w2"}, {"comment": "You might wanna watch the reviews from thesoundguys as well.

So when this sub or someone says that /r/HighQualityGifs is meta they mean that the sub is being meta-contextual. Think of it like how you would think about meta-cognition: cognition is essentially thinking, so meta-cognition is thinking *about* thinking. \n\nTherefore a meta-gif is a gif that either self-references or references other gifs, like a gif about other gifs. \n\nSee also: postmodernism \n\nAs an interesting aside, postmodernism is a very vague term but one way in which I think about it is when an art form stops being about the art and instead becomes something else linked to the art. A lot of postmodern art isn't about the pieces on display, its about the act of displaying the pieces (whatever they might be). /r/HighQualityGifs kind of turns this around. Originally gifs were used to transcribe moments of video into short, easily digested bytes while trying to keep the original material mostly intact. /r/HighQualityGifs has since evolved in that instead of directly transposing material, they are also adding and creating their own narrative to it.

And of course because no one understands lying, they believe him.\n\nSo there's a ton of jokes that can be played out, he says to a woman, \"The world is going to end unless we have sex right now.\" And she's like, \"We have to go right now, is your place close by?\" \n\nHe gets pulled over by the cops and his friend, played by Louis C.K. his drunk, and he tells the office that the man isn't drunk, and he believes him.\n\nIt was such a brilliant idea that other comedians were thinking to themselves, \"aahh I wish I thought of that.\"\n", "id": "d9uiyvi"}, {"comment": "Yeah I meant about the invention of lying, thanks. \nEdit: spelling", "id": "d9ukpg8"}, {"comment": "Can you eli5?", "id": "d9unqyf"}, {"comment": "Partially: https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/20xczn/its_your_choice/", "id": "d9utdl8"}, {"comment": "Not the full scene, but people have used clips of it before.", "id": "d9ufl41"}, {"comment": "> https://gfycat.com/SpanishRigidIndochinesetiger\n\n^(/u/kingeryck)", "id": "d9uwl0k"}, {"comment": "Oh I didn't make it", "id": "d9uz3hq"}, {"comment": "Oh... well... this is weird.

One of my 16mm projectors even has a sound/silent switch to adjust the framerate).\n\n***\n\nEdit: just in case it sounds like I'm nitpicking, I guess my main point is that it was a good idea to go with a lower framerate.

It basically says that if normal people in conversation (via chat) with another person and an AI cannot tell which is the AI, then it's achieved human-like intelligence.\n\nJohn Searle famously critiqued this test by claiming it assumes that \"if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck.\" He was saying that the appearance of consciousness is inadequate to conclude the existence of intelligence. He then proposed a thought experiment called the Chinese Room.\n\nImagine a room with a mail slot. You can drop questions or comments of any kind, written in Chinese into the slot and after a time, a totally natural response will emerge. In this way you can converse extensively with the room.\n\nWhat you don't know is that inside the room is a person with no knowledge of Chinese who is using an elaborate flow chart to take character sequences it gets through the slot to produce response sequences.\n\nSearle argued that it'd be absurd to claim the room had \"knew\" Chinese or had \"intelligence\".\n\nI personally find this argument unconvincing because, as I said if we accept materialism - which claims that consciousness is nothing more than bio-electric activity in the brain - then we're all Chinese rooms. Searle isn't a materialist though. He's a dualist - which means he believes the mind isn't strictly reducible to Brain activity.\n\nIf you're a dualist, then all the AI programming in the world won't make true intelligence because it's not just about the structure and function of the brain.", "id": "d7ai0yw"}], [{"comment": "The blue robot on the right thrown an upvote into the suitcase on the floor.

It starts by saying \"*But almost across the board, animal experts agree that Harambe\u2019s death was an unavoidable tragedy*\", and links testimonies, or to be exact, short quotes, twisting words and intents of their authors. Check this out:\n\n- Jane Goodall never supports the idea that Harambe's death was a good call, as demonstrated in her email saying that Harambed \"*looked as though the gorilla was putting an arm round the child \u2014 like the female who rescued and returned the child from the Chicago exhibit.*\"\n- Thane Maynard the guy that fucking too the decision. Of course he will not say \"I fucked up\". He's saving his ass.\n- Jerry Stones saying the \"*the child was in danger*\", not that Harambe was violent. Read his article, read how he describes a \"*gentle giant*\", and how \"*intelligent*\" he was. A child is in danger when left alone with virtually any animal, and it would have been dishonest from him to pretend otherwise. What he said isn't proof at all.\n- Ian Redmond never supports the theory, and in fact explains to deal with the situation peacefully.\n- Chris Brown is presented to only defend the zoo's actions, when he starts his post by saying that \"*Western lowland gorillas like Harambe are classified as critically endangered in the wild and behaviourally are renowned for being relatively placid, unless provoked.*\" He never says \"shooting him was the right call\". He says \"*If a tranquiliser rifle was used, the sedating effects of the dart wouldn\u2019t have been seen for at least 5 minutes. The impact of the dart may have also agitated Harambe further. But given that the whole incident lasted around 10 minutes, perhaps there was time with early action.*\" \n\nOn that link, finally, only two opinions don't seem to be twisted:\n\n- Jack Hanna's, someone that has [zero education on animals](http://www.jackhanna.com/about/), but plenty as a business leader; it doesn't take much to imagine why he'd go for the \"save the child !\" card.\n- Jeff Corwin's, although he offers no strong backing of this decision. He notably says \"*No one knows how that moment was going to escalate.*\"\n\nSo this is it. This what I found in about one hour of scanning experts advice and articles of about 15 differents media. Experts largely agree that the kill was uncalled for, and Corwin is the only one with a revelant opinion that I read saying that it wasn't a choice; and even that opinion is not based on \"wasn't a choice because Harambe was going to kill him\", but because of the potential kill.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not making shit up, but you are.

Like Anakin, he has a lot of raw talent, but it hasn't been nearly as honed as it was for Anakin before he became Vader. \n\nI got the impression that Anakin had about 10+ years more experience/training than Kylo did when they individually turned to the Dark Side, which explains (to me anyway), why he seemed so much weaker than he let on before revealing himself to Rey.

However after he frees Poe his logical character thus far falls apart for me.  \n  \nFinn was taken, abducted, whatever it was at an extremely young age into the First Order, his entire life has been indoctrination and military training to become a Stormtrooper. The only *family* he ever really has is his fellow Stormtroopers, he's known them for years, trained with them, lived with them, etc.. etc.. and you're going to tell me that because of the death of his friend he refuses to kill those people, yet somehow would rather kill his brothers he's known his whole life completely without issue? It just seems incredibly unlikely to me.  \n  \nI would have rather seen Finn constantly struggling throughout the movie with his decision he made, of the Stormtroopers he had to kill because he might have known one of them. In his escape with Poe I could have imagined him abstaining from firing back on the Stormtroopers (His brothers) until the last second when there was no other choice or else he and Poe would die, that decision would have led to them becoming too damaged and the subsequent crash. Thus Finn would now hate himself for not only killing his brothers but also believing he got Poe killed because he couldn't pull the trigger in time.  \n  \nIn the movie Finn is just far too normal in my opinion, he's been sheltered his whole life and has likely seen very few (If any) people outside of the New Order and wouldn't really know how to communicate with them as a normal person would, he lacks any semblance of what an indoctrinated soldier should have despite being broken away from that life now.  \n  \nPerhaps it's mundane but it's something that seriously bothered me the entire movie.  \n  \nEdit: Fixed a word.", "id": "d413225"}, {"comment": "I agree about the lack of remorse for killing his fellow Stormtroopers, that bothered me too.

Your claim that it \"simply posts shitty memes and anti-immigration\" stuff isn't true, however. There are plenty of posts on there related to the Trump campaign.\n\nThe only difference is, Sanders' campaign has been an uphill battle from the start, while Trump has pretty much been in cruise control since the beginning, with a few wins from Cruz and the likes. Sanders' campaign requires full dedication from his supporters (like you see on s4p in phonebanking and donations) while Trump doesn't need those, because everyone is already talking about him already, and he is leading in delegates.\n\nThat's pretty much why the subreddits are different. Sanders' supporters have to put in effort into the campaign, while Trump's supporters rarely have to. So on /r/the_donald, more time is spent having fun, while on /r/SandersForPresident, it's nearly impossible to relax, since Sanders still has a difficult path to the Democratic nomination.\n\nAlthough I personally am a Trump supporter, I admire /r/SandersForPresident more.

I personally *love* absurdist comedy because it, by definition, doesn't follow the sort of prescribed comedic formula of most comedies today. For me, the idea that white American Jack Black is playing a Mexican luchador who lives in a monastery is just too funny to pass up. I'll admit there were some moments that fell kinda flat (the whole eagle arc was strange), but overall it was a (tastefully) campy absurdist comedy that I really enjoyed.

But absurdist comedy can be really funny, because it *does something*, you know? I'm pretty sure that I got a copy in some Jack Black combo set.
