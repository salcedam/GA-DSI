His biggest problem in life right now when looking for a girl is that they're too easy, and \"no woman has ever said no to me\". I'm not kidding. I've gone to the bar with this dude, and he's not exaggerating. He's the kind of guy that girls flash their tits at for fun. Not you, because... 'Ew...'\n\nIt makes complete sense. Genetically, going for the top 20% is the best strategy, and historically, 60% of men, the bottom 60%, died never having reproduced. (compared with just 20% of women)\n\nIn order to be an 'okay' dude you need to at least make it into the lower part of that top 20%. To start being desirable and sought after, you need to break into the top 10%.\n\nThat's just the way it is. The sooner you accept your burden of performance, the sooner you can start putting in the work to get to that top 10% that most men see get girls easily.", "id": "d53rm67"}, {"comment": "I am not that bad looking, but what is definitely bad are my pictures.

I remember going to a club with a friend, girls would chat him up and I was basically invisible.  Sure, I was jealous, but I understood why: they were attractive.  moreso than me, at the time.  I used to be lazy and didnt hit the gym/exercise at all, and I guess it showed.\n\nI guess I understand this post well cause I used to be pretty out of shape and got really fit relatively (10-12% bodyfat, with decent muscle/etc).  thing is, when you doubt yourself it can be hard picturing someone else seeing you as attractive.  it's a confidence thing, other people are often really confident cause they have that look, and dont need to compensate with a personality/hobbies/whatever.  girls just want to fuck them based on that look.\n\nI actually have the app on my phone but dont use it, I dont consider myself to be at my best yet.  I use it as motivation so that when I do reach my goal body, i'll try my luck.  even if I dont have much success, at least it's additional motivation to train.  all I know is people do treat you way better when you are fit and in great shape, so might as well keep improving.\n\nrules 1 and 2?  oh yeah, they definitely matter.  and being the most interesting guy in the world doesnt mean shit unless you have the looks to back it up.  however, it's better to try and fail, than not try at all.  remember, you miss 100% of the shots you dont take.", "id": "d52fgra"}, {"comment": "Holy shit this got to me", "id": "d52ah6a"}, {"comment": "I hear some chicks are more into your money than your looks.

He doesn't emotionally abuse me, try to control me and all my decisions, lie to me. Honestly, I feel this soooo much. I actually ate up my ex's PATHETIC excuse that he felt he had a 'right to privacy' and tolerated him SETTING HIS NOTIFICATIONS to OFF to avoid being caught out again, then GUILTED ME for accidentally seeing his scheming, two-faced lies. That loser, /u/walks_with_penis_out deserves what he will get, spending his days approaching 40 and wanking over rape porn...sad little human.  What's worse is that he is a father. And I use that term loosely. Ladies, when a man who leeches off you...a human parasite who takes all your money, smashes your car and ACTUALLY has NO remorse or feeling of obligation towards being a ethical human, when you're finally free and experience a real man...well fuck. There's nothing like it. To be free of his shit and his constant, 24-7, wake-up-at-6am and get high ways? His drug addiction?  His pathetic, grubby, stinky, cheap, sad, detached dependency and refusal to take responsibility for his own life and problems? Soooooo good. When a man who contribues ZERO dollars, assistance, help, actual grown up life shit, tries to control all your decisions, personal and financial...run screaming. A man who constantly threatens to leave, despite giving you NOTHING in the way of equality or respect? That is EMOTIONAL ABUSE.\n\nOn the plus side, my ex is the reason my new man says I give the best head jobs on god's green earth....cuz my a**hole ex forced me to do things I never consented to....well hay, I'm a silver linings type of gal ;)", "id": "daujyl6"}], [{"comment": "I'll be honest,\n\nI hate this app, the concept, you guys, and the convenience-culture it engenders that makes us treat each other as 'means' and not 'ends'.

Let's put your engineering mind to use shall we? \n\nUse my 10% rule, 10% of people are the high functioning social people and 10% are the high level engineering/computational minds. That means only 1% of people will have both traits. Math right? ;)\n\nNow let's look at your school. In general the people who are going to go to engineering school are going to do that because that's what they're drawn to. Those magic 1% people who can rock both worlds, they're very unlikely to go the engineering route. Why? Because although they CAN, it doesn't use all their talents. So you're much more likely to find someone in the sales/business world who is the social person AND has the engineering mind to back it up. \n\nI don't want to make it sound like it's bad to \"settle\" as \"just an engineer.\" I'm just saying extrovert/social people are going to gravitate to that even if they have the potential to do other things. That social ability is a two way magnet, others are drawn to them but they are also drawn to others. I personally thrive in groups, teaching, being in front of people and even though I have a strong artistic side, I'd shrivel up and die in a introverted environment like computer sciences.\n\nDoes this make sense?

Typically they get another company to do it for them - this is called \"merchant services\". So Joe's Deli signs up with Chase, which offers merchant services. Then Joe logs into his Chase merchant account and has dozens of fraud prevention settings he can turn on or off, things like whether they verify the expiration date, whether they check the zip code, etc. He then gets his website guy to add a box for inputting the zip code and whatever else he wants on the website, code to handle rejections, and so on. Then people can swipe their cards at the deli, or plug them into Joe's website for online ordering, and the info will be sent over to Chase to handle verification/fraud prevention and the actual charge.\n\nLarger businesses do it similarly, although they may cut out the middle man and work with credit card companies directly.\n\nEvery business has to decide for itself how much fraud prevention is really necessary, in my experience almost no small business enables 100% of the features (which would include things like checking customer's full name and billing address, which is easy to make a mistake on or just not format it correctly or whatever, it complicates things). Theoretically they could skip all fraud prevention and just take the credit card number alone - bad idea, but merchant services companies allow it. \n\nThe business taking your card number is the one losing money in the event of fraud, and more fraud prevention may reduce how much they end up losing overall, but it's also more hassle for their customers and more work for their programmers. As a business, you're *going to get fraud* on a certain percent of transactions no matter what, so it turns into a numbers game: compare the frequency of fraud and how much it costs you each time vs. the cost of supporting a little more fraud prevention, how much less fraud you expect to get that way, and the chance of losing customers due to the inconvenience of it.\n\nBy the way this is why some places tack on a \"convenience fee\" or whatever to credit card transactions, you're subsidizing the work they put into their CC transaction code, the cut the merchant services company takes from every charge, and the fees on fraudulent transactions.\n\n**TL;DR**: every business has to deal with the occasional fraudulent transaction, and decides for itself how much fraud prevention it's worthwhile to bother with. Not everyone asks for a zip, or CVN, or cardholder name, etc. You can probably find someone who will take the card number alone (hopefully rare these days), or card number + the CVN number that you guessed/brute forced, or card number + zip that you guessed.

After 3 years I *still* feel the pressure of some of these things.\n\nMen on the other hand have more agency in improving their dating success. All the things that make them attractive in the dating pool have to do with that agency: career, income, active/hobbies, intelligence - entrepreneurial, education. These are mostly things you can acquire throughout life. \n\nSo I'm sorry for the men who are short - there is no excuse for some of the treatment I see in r/short & blatant social discrimination hurts. That being said, afaik there probably aren't going to be any equality marches, legal funds, or legislation protecting their dating rights anytime soon...\n\n", "id": "d7akffx"}, {"comment": "Why shouldn't society accept \"discrimination\" based upon height?

If someone happens to be unfortunate looking, it's easy for people to quickly dismiss them on tinder; on okc, people will check out your profile based on Match Percent and give you more than a one second chance. It would be harder to instantly dismiss someone who you share many interests with (like a ~90% match). I'm in a happy relationship now, and I accredit that to using sites/apps to look for great people who share common interests, vs looking for random people in bars (because if someone is at a bar/club, I probably wouldn't have been interested in them anyway).\n\nI of course haven't seen your tinder pics, but I'd imagine that if you seem to think they're terrible pictures, you should try an app/site that isn't 100% reliant on people making judgements on your pictures alone; also you should probably learn to take better pictures haha.", "id": "d1105fx"}, {"comment": "Go out with some guy friends and ask them to take Tinder pictures with/for you.

I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. You should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over your son, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the movie theater managers didn't agree with me. They KICKED ME OUT of the movie theater, and I didn't even finish watching the Cars movie. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my semen after it already dried out and solidified on the seats. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean semen after its dried out? You CLEAN semen after its FRESH out of your cock, not an hour after you fucking nutted. This is a fucking OUTRAGE.

It also has a strong sexual tone to it. When paired with \"Cunt\", it strengthens the sexuality of the phrase. However, \"cunt\" is also a term to describe a personality trait. She is attempting to paint a picture of a sweet little spitfire. Bonus is that \"cunt\", in the USA, at least, is on the highest scale of swear words, right above \"fuck\".. so you know she is so incredibly edgy and a free-thinker, who will speak her mind and be direct and exciting. It also shows you she is not like \"other girls\", and can hang with the guys cause she is rude, crude, and totally down to be a dude. \n\nIn conclusion, she wants you to think of a \"sweet pussy\" first.

If it makes him happy, I'm happy about it. :) And the same goes for me. Neither of us are worried that loving another person will diminish our own relationship.\n\nNowhere does it say that we are only capable of loving one person. Certain widespread religions have made it pretty taboo, but it's not a strict limit. In fact, that myth leads to a ton of harm in many relationships. \"I'm married, I'm happy, I love my partner, but I have feelings for someone else too. What's wrong with me?\" *(The answer: Absolutely nothing.)*\n\nJust as we are capable of loving our children and family equally, so too are we capable of loving more than one partner (sexual or otherwise). \n\nIt comes down to the difference between swinging (merely sleeping with other partners) and something like, say, polyamory (where you have actual relationships with other people). Polyamory is not for everyone, of course. But where it works, it works well.\n\n> Or that they're getting way more than you are and they don't want to sleep with you anymore?\n\nThis is a simple matter of communication, I'd think. If you and your partner aren't willing to be open and honest with each other at all times, is it really worth being in a long-term relationship with them?\n\nAnd I mean, sex is sex. Preferences change. One person's fantasy may completely squick their partner out. Sex drives can just naturally wane. There are so many factors that can lead to a diminishing sex life. Being a bit more open about intimacy with other people can help, rather than hinder. It's all about making sure everyone is on the same page.

Your body's primary source of fuel is Carbs, your body changes the carbs to Glucose to use (hence it doesn't matter if you eat sugar or bread it is used the same way). Unused glucose gets turned to fat as storage to burn later. But your body has to burn the glucose stores first before it will use the fats.\n\nIf you starve your body of carbs, it will go to your secondary fuel source (proteins I believe) however if you overcompensate with fats it will use that instead.

It seems everyone is paired off and although I try to not make any assumptions about others, my experience is that there are a lot of \"damaged goods\" out there when it comes to the 30-something singles crowd. People who are not married or in long term relationships seem to be single because they really are sort of emotional shitstorms or have other fundamental problems with their lives that make them toxic to others. Many newly divorced people too who can be total wildcards. Sometimes really great or \"I can see why you had a messy divorce\" people. \n\nI almost get the feeling that those of us who are single for reasons that aren't due to being messed up (e.g. did many years of schooling and focused on building a career for our 20s and early 30s) sort of give up. Possibly this also comes from society telling us that if we're over the age of 28 and not married, we're past our best before date.\n\nThen again, I can't really bring myself to date someone much under the age of 30. Hearing about all the same anxiety as a new university graduate that took me years of hard work to rise beyond or realizing just how financially unstable and limited most 20 somethings are gives me reason to look for people more in my own age group. \n\nStrangely, my best success at meeting motivated, sane, other 30 somethings worth dating has been joining local makerspaces and arts groups. Maybe you should give that a try.

The greatest concentrations of hipsters can be found living in the Williamsburg, Wicker Park, and Mission District neighborhoods of major cosmopolitan centers such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco respectively.  Although \"hipsterism\" is really a state of mind,it is also often intertwined with distinct fashion sensibilities. Hipsters reject the culturally-ignorant attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage and thrift store inspired fashions, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and sometimes thick rimmed glasses.  Both hipster men and women sport similar androgynous hair styles that include combinations of messy shag cuts and asymmetric side-swept bangs.  Such styles are often associated with the work of creative stylists at urban salons, and are usually too \"edgy\" for the culturally-sheltered mainstream consumer.  The \"effortless cool\" urban bohemian look of a hipster is exemplified in Urban Outfitters and American Apparel ads which cater towards the hipster demographic. Despite misconceptions based on their aesthetic tastes, hipsters tend to be well educated and often have liberal arts degrees, or degrees in maths and sciences, which also require certain creative analytical thinking abilities.  Consequently many hipsters tend to have jobs in the music, art, and fashion industries.  It is a myth that most hipsters are unemployed and live off of their parent's trust funds.\n\n>Hipsters shun mainstream societal conventions that apply to dating preferences and traditional \"rules\" of physical attraction.  It is part of the hipster central dogma not to be influenced by mainsream advertising and media, which tends to only promote ethnocentric ideals of beauty.  The concepts of androgyny and feminism have influenced hipster culture, where hipster men are often as thin as the women they date. The muscular and athletic all-American male ideal is not seen as attractive by confident and culturally-empowered hipster women who instead view them as symbols of male oppression, sexism, and misogyny.  Likewise, culturally-vapid sorority-type girls with fake blond hair, overly tanned skin, and \"Britney Spears tube-tops\" are not seen as attractive by cultured hipster males who instead see them as symbols of female insecurity, low self-esteem, and lack of cultural intelligence and independent thinking.  Hipsters are also very racially open-minded, and the greatest number of interracial couples in any urban environment are typically found within the hipster subculture.\n\n>Although hipsters are technically conformists within their own subculture, in comparison to the much larger mainstream mass, they are pioneers and leaders of the latest cultural trends and ideals.  For example, the surge of jeans made to look old and worn (i.e. \"distressed\"), that have become prevalent at stores such as The Gap, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Hollister, were originally paraded by hipsters who shopped in thrift stores years before such clothing items were mass produced and sold to the mainstream consumer.  The true irony here is that many of the detractors of hipster culture are in fact unknowingly following a path that hipsters have carved out years before them.  This phenomena also applies to music as well, as many bands have become successful and known to mainstream audiences only because hipsters first found and listened to them as early-adopters of new culture.  Once certain concepts of fashion and music have reached mainstream audiences, hipsters move on to something new and improved.\n\n>Because of the rise of various online photo-blog and social networking sites, insights into urban hipster culture is reaching sheltered suburban audiences at an exponential rate.  Cultural \"norms\" have been deconstructed by hipster culture as a whole. Hipsterism is often dismissed as just an image thing by some, but the culture as a whole is effecting changes in society, leading to feelings of insecurity and resentment in people who are no longer a part of the cultural ruling class. For example, a lot of anti-hipster sentiment evidently comes from culturally-clueless suburban frat boy types who feel that the more sensitive, intelligent, and culturally aware hipster ideal threatens their insecure sense of masculinity.  Anti-hipster sentiment often comes from people who simply can't keep up with social change and are envious of those who can.\n\n\n---\n\n_A conversation outside a hipster bar in downtown NYC:_\n\n\n\n_Frat Boy #1:  Dude, are you having any luck picking up     chicks in there?_\n\n\n\n_Frat Boy #2:  Man...I haven't experienced anything like this before.  These chicks are totally rejecting me and going for all these hipster guys in tight pants and shaggy hair instead._\n\n\n\n_Frat Boy #1:  Maybe we should head back up to that bar in Murry Hill where you hooked up with that drunk b*tch from Alpha Sigma Phi last week?_\n\n\n\n_Frat Boy #2:  Yeah...I don't think we have what it takes to compete with these guys in here.  These hipster chicks won't even give us the time of the day!_\n\n\n---\n\n[^(about)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autourbanbot/wiki/index) ^| [^(flag for glitch)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autourbanbot&subject=bot%20glitch&message=%0Acontext:https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/5cqm54/the_wall_isnt_the_only_thing_thats_rising/d9zi4t7) ^| ^(**Summon**: urbanbot, what is something?)", "id": "d9zi5m3"}, {"comment": "i feel like only new yorkers would get this reference.

", "id": "d9zrlt8"}, {"comment": "Apologies, I reread it myself and I didn't state it the best - I just woke up here, it's only 5am.\n\nEssentially, it doesn't matter that the popular vote proved a failed campaign for Hillary (which I agree with) considering it also recorded low turnout for Trump, despite what some narratives will tell you (most rural areas saw same or lower turnout than the Romney election prior.) The great failure here was primarily in the rust belt, which was more or less ignored by Hillary, to her ultimate detriment.\n\nHowever, when looking to see if this would be an *uncommon* opinion across the US, using the EC is flawed, considering it is granting greater weight to votes from less populated states. This is objective fact - the fact Wyoming, with a population of just over half a million, gets 3 votes makes the value of those votes greater. California has a population of ~38.8 million, if votes were equal to Wyoming they would have ~66 EC votes. Incidentally, this is why there is always proposals to kill the EC and move to a popular/ranked vote system, which I support even though I live in a state that benefits from the EC (Alaska - in my case our votes are considered irrelevant by the times polls close because the EC determines a winner before then, if it was popular that wouldn't necessarily be the case).\n\nThus, since the EC weights votes differently, a more accurate representation of whether it was an *uncommon* (sic: **unpopular**) opinion would be to look at popular vote. This clearly shows large swaths of the US where this (voting for Trump) *would* be an uncommon view, particularly in large urban areas that are not beholden to a dying manufacturing/industrial complex. The fact that is is also a college-educated woman voting for Trump also adds to an *extremely* uncommon demographic, as most college-educated woman turned out in support for Hillary (if they turned out).", "id": "d9zst51"}, {"comment": "I see what you mean, but as I addressed in the other post I referred to, the important of a state to a nation does not simply lie with its population, and secondly, you cannot have a Republic and not use EC, it would be undemocratic. What you are saying would only make sense if America ceased to be a Republic, which by its very nature, places more importance on states than people, because it is built on a foundation of higher freedom for each person by allowing them to move to a state whose politics correspond to their own personal opinion.\n\nA Republic is much different than a standard democracy, it has other advantages and disadvantages, and a greater degree of freedom for the individual and the state is exactly what America was founded on.\n\nYour argument is similar to those who want Socialism in America; it is not the type of political system that the Americans desire, it has advantages and disadvantages, but overall it does not appeal to Americans who follow a different ideology. The people who want the change the EC either do not understand how it works, or has not at all considered the consequences and the zeitgeist of America. The same goes for the socialists. \n\n", "id": "d9ztlo1"}, {"comment": "Your argument does not make sense.\n\nA republic and democracy, at their core, are simply governments controlled by a majority of elected officials determined by a populace. Nowhere does that put extra pressure on providing states with lower population a greater weight in the election.\n\nIn your particular case, you are associating a republic with the classic Greco-Roman case, rather than a purer democracy such as Athens (speaking from the same historical perspective).\n\nWhy, pray tell, should we weigh some votes higher than others? Is the opinion value of someone in California lower than someone in Wyoming? Why?\n\nThe EC exists because at the time of the signing of the Constitution the US was a very different place, and the states were much closer to their own little fiefdoms than they are now. The EC was a concession to get some states to sign in. But history and times change. It would be closer to making more sense if we continued to add House seats as we got more population, but we didn't - we arbitrarily capped it. This has allowed lower population states to continuously get more power every election cycle per capita, while disenfranchising higher population states, and completely negating the voice of the far West Coast.\n\n \nIf the original EC model was followed, lower population states would still get more votes, but larger population states would still be swinging more votes than now, because they would (and should) have more representatives. Is a person in California worth 4/5ths of a person in Wyoming?\n\nThis is a continuous change that is just going to have more and more impact every election. I don't think it's right to consider the value of someone's opinion *less* than an equal citizen - this isn't a socialist ideal, this is the ideal of civil rights and treating fairly. The US is a very different country than it was in 1776, and continuing to pander to these same broken notions represents a failure in the country as a whole. Or should we continue considering blacks 2/3rds of a person as well?\n\nThat being said, as someone who isn't from the US (such as yourself, based on your name and post history) I wouldn't expect you to understand how the EC properly plays out in the US.", "id": "d9zwv6n"}, {"comment": "I already explained in the post why we should weigh some votes higher than others. Because in a giant democracy which necessarily needs to be a modified one in one way or another because of its size, in this case a Republic, production and population, or in other words, a state's value to a country, is in no way correlated, and as the example I gave in my post, the highly populated states do in many cases not contribute much to the nation because they consume without producing much. Now a state that has a lot of production, can in an age of industry and robotics have a much lower population and add much more value, than a state that has a lot of consumption, which doesn't add much value, and can sustain just about as many people as you can find. It's a case of smaller states making a bigger contribution and having more importance to a country. \n\nIf you think that one's knowledge is limited to where one is from, and that one is innately limited from \"understanding anything\" because they don't live there, then please confirm this point of view and we won't argue further, because in that case you do not qualify for the level of intelligence required for a serious debate. \n\nI have no time for the irrational or superstitious.

Taking all this into consideration, when we deduct all the illegitimate votes we can assume that Trump in all likelihood also won the popular vote.\n\n- The electoral college exists because America is a *Republic* that means a certain amount of autonomy is given to each state, and therefore an election is decided by the number of states who vote, not the number of people. This is extremely important because many of the high population states do not actually produce anything, let's take New York City as an example:\n\nNew York City has a population of 8 million people, that is equivalent to Nebraska, Iowa, Montana and Idaho put together.\n\nWhat does New York City Produce? Not much really. It has no factories, it has no farms, it has no power plants, no military bases, it doesn't have anything that has much value to the nation. It has bankers, Wall Street, and a lot of financial business that make money off of money in the states, it doesn't actually add anything, it mostly just shifts the money from the poor to the rich, or from the rich to the other rich.\n\nComparatively Iowa has the 2nd highest agricultural production of any state in the nation and 100% of it's output is used in states like Montana and Arkansas as feed. Montana has 3 heads of cattle per person, and depends on Iowa to produce feed, and in that way, it makes up a massive share of the beef industry for the nation. Nebraska produces more Wheat than any other state of which 60% is used for non-human consumption, and 40% is used for human consumption. Idaho is the number one producer of potatoes in the nation.\n\nNow, without the Electoral college New York City has as much weight as these four states combined, while contributing with pretty much only consumption. The electoral college ensures that the producing areas of the nation are more valuable than the consuming areas, because this is the foundation on which an economy rests.

If you're talking about him being complimentary, I don't understand what's necessarily bad about that when you consider the fact that women tend to put more effort into their appearance and it means more to them when you compliment them on that basis. Guys and girls generally compliment women on their appearance than guys or girls compliment men on their appearance, likely for the similar reasons so I don't see him doing that even with his daughters as out of the ordinary. I do agree that it's sexist the same way me pulling out chairs for girls and not guys is.\n\nI don't think hypergamy equates to treating women as trophies. People that are in the position to get the most attractive mate possible are going to do just that. Younger women are typically more attractive than older women and rich guys are typically more attractive than broke ones. It's not a coincidence that you see rich, famous old guys with young, attractive women and vice versa. I don't think that should be a knock against anybody because most people who could get a more attractive mate would do so, it's only natural and it doesn't necessarily indicate that one is denying the personhood of their mate it's just that they find a certain level of attractiveness to be a prerequisite.\n\nThe Miss America shit sounds creepy, fuck that.\n\nI don't think abortion is just an issue of whether or not a woman should be able to control what happens to her body because there's another life involved and he shares that perspective.\n\n", "id": "d9z2kvs"}, {"comment": "Funny people say they voted for trump for the joke.

Yes, I know that most people on tinder are looking for sex; I am too when I go on! But when a dude starts off by with a generic compliment or \"hey cutie ;),\" any interest I held for him is gone.

Rather, on my best tinder date, the guy and I just talked with absolutely zero sexual pressure or flirting (philosophy, astrology, horror movies, my Cool Apple Fact, the meaning of our names, that he was into MtG, etc) for like 2-3 hours before we seemed to exhaust topics and I asked if he wanted to make out. He fucked me senseless after that.\n\nBut it was nice because he was actually interested in what I had to say from the start. We've been regular fwbs since April and I think he's only complimented me, like twice? I have a nice smile and I'm actually a lot smarter than I act. But they feel real because he's always treated me like I'm a dang person that he's engaging with, not someone he's trying to influence to gain sex.\n\nIt's hard to describe what makes things dehumanizing if you have no frame of reference for what it's like growing up feeling like your *only* value to the other sex is your sexual value. Like, I was first groped at age 8, which is neither uncommon or the worst first sexual harassment a girl can experience. I was not too young to understand that this was Completely Different than my sister and I \"honking\" on each other for laughs. This guy didn't see me as a person who would be uncomfortable by this contact, he saw me as a budding breast for him to touch. And it goes on, for the rest of your life as a girl and as a woman. You are a body to ogle and grope and catcalling from a passing car. Your body is everyone else's to criticize for being too skinny or too far or too flat or in any way not what's sexually desirable, and your body is all you are. And I guess it's easy for most guys to shrug off and say \"this doesn't change that I am a person,\" but it also doesn't seem many men experience women making them feel valued as a friend or more, only to turn around and ghost them or treating them as worthless once they've had sex with them. It's a tiring game to play.\n\nIt gets even more tiring when men hear this and say \"it's because women are functionally different from men. They're more emotional whereas men are more sexual.\" Like... no? I don't want a deep emotional relationship from every guy I'd like to hook up with.

Make yourself seem like someone they'd enjoy having sex with?\n\nLike someone I can have a real conversation with and who I feel like I can get along with, to me, seems like someone who would also be interested in having sex *with* me and not just using my body as an upgrade from his regular masturbatory aides.

Do \"your eyes are so preety in your 2nd picture, they really compliment the rest of your face\". Also if a girl has any features/abnormalities that can be considered both attractive and unattractive be sure to point them out (for instance freckles on a girl, but any abnormality works, and remember it's \"your freckles look good on you *specific pic*\" and not \"I like your freckles\"). Pointing out a specific picture in general also leads to discussion (like what I did) True, but your last picture still puts Jessica Alba to shame. Btw, what are you looking for on tinder?\" I had a creative (never be bland and generic) way to say a certain picture was good which will always lead her to be like \"oh, what about it stands out (*preens*). Also whenever I go for the \"what are you looking for on tinder line\" I always somthing else in the same message (allowing the girl to answer the other thing and completely ignore the \"what are you looking for part\") and if she ignores it, that means she's dtf but wants to be treated like a gf. The only time I'll just do a straight up \"your preety\" type compliment is when I'll message in the morning and say good morning (insert either \"beautiful then smiley emoji\" or \"sunshine and sun emoji\"). Then after they reply generally follow up with somthing (like ironing out details of a date, like what time and where and if she wants a ride). Also always say \"would you like a ride\" not \"do you need a ride\" everything should be presented as a choice not a \"need\" on tinder your talking to a person who doesn't know or how you talk and you're using a purely textual medium, wording is imperative.

I'm looking for a FWB that I can take on dates or if compatibility is *very* high a gf (not interested in 1 time hookups). I think having sex early (often purely casual sex) is a great way to find a compatible gf and to weed out ones that wouldn't work out. Waiting until you've already fallen head over heels in a mixture of infactuation and actual love for a girl to fuck her sets people up for being in bad relationships because now you finally got to have sex and then that makes the relationship seems really special for a while then when that wears off and you realize you're not a good match you're already very invested in the relationship. And you may not notice in the most early stages of the relationship that you're a bad match because you're unifocused on getting laid.

You are basically asking them to return the favor. Thats just not how this stuff works. It needs to be done smoother. Complimenting right away is clunky and lacks a segue. Its pretty similar to the construction of an argumentative paper for an English class, honestly. \n\nBest case scenario, the girl says she likes you back and then whats your move? Its been made kind of awkward. It ruins the thrill of 'finding out' she likes you.\n\nThey call it 'game' because it really is a game. If you spoil the game early then thats one way of ruining the fun time.\n\n-\n\nSome girls, not every, go for money and thats undeniable. OP is saying (or maybe not) if you've got high confidence, attractiveness and popularity then you wont need as much well. \n\nCrudely put, it's almost like a rating scale of 0-100. If you're a billionaire then you still have a high enough score even if you don't have the other qualities. Same with looks, popularity, and confidence.\n\n-\n\nI dont like the wording hes using by saying \"convincing\" her you are higher on the social ladder. If you work hard at your career, work out , take care of your appearance clothes etc, work hard at lowering anxiety, and try to have more fun and, in turn, help others have more fun then you will actually 'raise yourself on the social ladder'.\n\nBut yeah, girls want what they cant have a lot of the time, again not always.\n\n-\n\nThe last lines he stated are pretty good too. Hes basically saying dont sound desperate but dont sound like you dont give a shit about her at all. Pretty basic stuff. \n\nThe last line he is saying that if she thinks you are cool and not weird/annoying/creepy and shes decently attracted to you then shes gonna keep an eye on you some of the time you arent talking to her. Meanwhile, its making you seem cooler because you have no problem socializing well with other people, and dont need to cling to someone like a more anxious person would.\n\n-\n\nIt kinda sucks he got downvoted because its pretty good and actually useful information. It really stinks if it got downvoted by guys that try anything other than their norm only once and then revert back.  You have to keep trying new things until something works. Usually its not about 'what should i say to a girl' but its more about 'what should i not say'. \n\nI've learned to not say or do things that may be weird or awkward in conversations with girls. What ends up happening is time goes by- 5 or 10 minutes- and the girls realizes you can keep an actual good conversation where you arent creepy or awkward and then you can segue out and go talk to others and she's left noticing that you stand out in a good way. Theres really nothing special, its just practice and learning what NOT to do.\n\nWith some practice you then get more confident and start trying to add things in that she would find more attractive, like more witty things about what shes already mentioned in the conversation.\n\nYoull know it works if you notice her out of the corner of your eye or while gazing around the room when you are talking to someone else or if she comes back to talk to you later. Shes literally wondering if you are attracted to her because you seemed happy to talk to her and interested in her but it wasnt too clingy, and NOW you have no problem chatting with others. She wants to know if you like her now. Its the game. \n\nAlso smiling and eye contact help everyone want to be around you more. Thats just good advice for talking to anyone.\n\n-\n\nAnother thing, just cause he may take ideas from seduction or Red Pill doesnt mean hes a shitty guy or anything, every group has good and bad ideas.

", "id": "czq760d"}, {"comment": "Although you may not be serious with the classic Tinder response #128, which is \"...rule #1 & #2\", but I do want to point out something.\n\n\nThere was a time that I truly believed that's the only thing that matters, especially whenever I saw posts like this. I am pretty sure that a lot of guys that browse this sub also believe that or have fully bought into it one time or another.\n\n\nHowever, what I've realized is that the number of times that such lines work is very few, and because it is so \"shocking\" it gives the illusion that it happens more than it does. That's because it leaves a strong impression in the mind when we encounter it. With that being said, I don't think it's entirely about the guy being good looking, but also has to do with the girl, her state of being, what she's especially looking for, and even the time of the interaction. \n\n\nThe only reason I am saying all of this is for people to avoid the mistakes that I have made.\n\n\n1. Because I have tried those lines and they didn't work, I spent a long period of time feeling down about not being good looking enough, aka not following the rule 1 enough. That was complete waste of my time and energy. I realized how foolish it is to allow something like that to define my self worth. \n\n\n2. There were probably a lot of times that I could have gotten laid, if I were just tiny bit patient and smooth enough. However, seeing posts like this had it in my mind that it was the only proper way to approach girls on tinder. I thought that any other way was just wasting time because girls have so much going on on their tinder. In a sense, I was being an impatient little bitch who didn't want to learn to properly attract someone. It turns out, there is an art to social interaction that can lead it one way or another. I really approached it with a mind-set that set me up for failure because I didn't even bother to give myself the opportunity to lead it into something more than the shock value.\n\n\n3. It really isn't all cookie cutter experience where all girls are like this or all girls are like that. There was a time when I had messaged 10 - 15 girls that weren't talking to me \"How am I supposed to hit it and quit it if you won't talk?!\", which got them to start talking to me after ignoring my initial message. \n\n\nBasically, I think the keys to success as DJ Khaled would say is pretty simple. Be the best version of yourself to the point where you are loving and appreciating yourself. I genuinely believe that the best thing to do when you have been feeling depressed about not getting matches or getting responses is to just quit tinder all together for some time. I believe that you do get what you focus on and believe and expect. If you are coming from desperation and neediness, it still shows and people can still \"sense\" it whether it's in person or online. I think that your state of being and mindframe is highly important. \n\n\nAnd simply make sure to take good pictures, and good pictures only. \n\n\nAnd learn to be patient. I remember some guy here saying that for the most part, all you got to do is initiate a meet-up, whether it's coffee or a drink. And then once she feels you out and is not threatened by the whole \"this guy can be a killer/rapist/dirty/diseased\" then she will be open to casual sex. But you can totally ruin it from the beginning by coming off with lines like this. Of course, this is not to say that this kind of lines don't work. I am simply saying that it may not be the best approach for the majority of the people. I also remember one guy that posted bunch of screen shots like this saying that for the most part, it doesn't work. \n\n\nJust be patient and learn to do things properly. We as the people have to stop chasing after short cuts and magic pills. Once we streamline things, things can automatically become magical. However, it does require some work and effort in the beginning.
