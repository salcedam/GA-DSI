Fight the water struggle, have worked with activists in Flint and around the state. \n\nConcerning Flint, there is more context for why Snyder gets the blame. Flint was under Emergency Management from 2011 to 2015. The mechanism of emergency management is integral to understanding why Snyder is to be held accountable for not only the Flint water crisis, but also Detroit's bankruptcy, the clusterfuck that is Detroit Public Schools, and many other issues around the state. The decision to switch water sources from the Detroit system to water from the Flint River was a cost savings one. It was made solely by Darnell Earley, a non-elected official who was appointed EM of Flint by Gov. Snyder. He reported directly to Snyder, and no one else, including the citizens of Flint. This made the mess that everyone around the country knows about. But one of the reasons Snyder is so hated by activists in the state is his reaction to the Flint water crisis. Snyder knew that there were problems with the water and that folks in Flint were getting sick in the Spring of 2015. It wasn't until October that the residents of Flint were notified about unsafe water. Many believe that this is criminal neglect of his constituents. Many have died from Legionnaires. Tens of thousands of children are at risk for the consequences that lead poisoning brings. Snyder's response to Flint has been appalling. From blaming the people of Flint to using public money to pay his lawyers for his defense and for PR counseling. He is a disgusting man that subverts the democratic power of the people of Michigan. EMs and the way he pushes legislation through the Senate that the voters have just voted against is absolutely unacceptable.

First and foremost, get a board that is the right size for you, or really, just get the biggest board you can for your first time. I'm fairly heavy, but I have a large, stable board that is easy for anyone. \n\nIt's OK to start on your knees, but I recommend just getting to standing. It's way more fun, and you can always drop back to your knees if you need/want to. There will be a handle in the center of the board. This is where you will want your weight to be centered, or maybe just slightly behind. Oh, and you want your paddle to be long enough that your wrist can just barley stretch over the handle when your arm is raised straight over your head.\n\nWade out to knee deep in the water with your board, or just deep enough so the fins aren't dragging. Start on the board on all fours, hand and knees, with your paddle held perpendicular across the board. Basically do a downward dog move to get to standing. \n\nPush up with your hands and step into a solid standing position. I like to tell people to pretend they are carrying a heavy tray of drinks as they stand up, meaning you need to keep your shoulders squared, your knees bent, and your weight slightly forward on the balls of your feet. You want your feet slightly wider than shoulder width. Move around a little, wiggle the board side to side. Realize that it really is going to hold you and allow you to magically walk on water!\n\nGet your paddle in the water ASAP. You get a lot of support from the force of the water against your paddle, it is like a third leg. People sometimes get excited/nervous and tend to take their paddle out of the water, but if you keep that momentum and resistance going it will help you immensely. Try to bend at the waist a but as you reach forward to pull water towards you in as straight a stroke as possible. Work on switching sides and getting the paddle in the water as efficiently as possible. You want to work on keep your arms straight, especially the top one, because you will get a lot more power that way and not tire out your arms. Use your core and your whole body to paddle. You can turn around quickly by paddling forward on one side of that board and then paddling backward on the other side. You want your grip to be nice and wide for power, wider than shoulder width. \n\nHave fun! Remember that falling in the water is fine, you have a huge self rescue device (the board). But really, you needn't fall in at all. If you are unstable, get your paddle back in the water or drop to your knees. Look out at the horizon, or at least in front of you, not down at your feet. Hopefully you are trying your first time on flat water, but if there are swells or small waves, you will be most stable by pointing the nose of the board directly intro the oncoming wave. Oh, and don't forget to wiggle your feet and move around on the board a bit. First timers sometimes tend to clench up, especially your feet. There are my tips! Forgive the typos and rambling.

You need to move the head/jaw a bit of distance to accomplish that.  \n\nYou keep your wrist from getting fucked up by having your wrist straight, being used to taking an impact on your wrist, and knowing how to throw a proper punch.  By straight I mean the main two knuckles in line with the forearm for bare knuckle, and closer to the middle of the glove for a boxing match.

Trigger picks up the first strike (lightning actually has two \"strikes\": one that sends out lots of little \"fingers\" of electricity to find the path of least resistance, and one that's the bigger, single bolt that we see), triggers the camera to catch the second strike, and the camera triggers the strobe to light the couple.\n3. Multiple exposure: the photographer shoots the couple and the lightning bolt separately, with the camera mounted on a tripod to keep framing the same, and then merges the two in post-production.\n\n**Edit:** /u/justintibbitts (the actual photographer behind the shot) [chimed in below](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerfectTiming/comments/4xtp2w/my_girlfriends_sister_got_married_this_past/d6indak), said it was a variation of method #1, and gave directions for how to find a higher resolution version of the shot.", "id": "d6igj48"}, {"comment": "Hey shot, I used method #1 to capture this shot.

The ingredients to create/sustain flame are heat, fuel, and oxygen (and chemical chain reaction). The flame front we see is where the proper balance of these ingredients exists.\nTake a candle flame, for example. When we begin lighting a candle we are introducing heat and the wax travels up the wick where it is vaporized as fuel. Surrounding the wick is now an abundance of fuel which has displaced oxygen from its immediate surrounding. So the flame front is where these two gases meet in the right quantities for the chemical reaction of combustion to exist.\nAn easy experiment to see where the gases meet is to place a metal screen over a candle flame. You cut the top of the flame off and you can see a circle on the screen to show you the \"hollow\" center of the candle flame. Within the flame is excess fuel and outside is excess oxygen.\nAnother real world example happens everyday during structure fires. Often flames pour out of broken windows and doors. This occurs in part because the oxygen in the room has been consumed by the fire, there by leaving behind an abundance of heat and fuel in the room. Opening/breaking a window allows the heat/fuel combo to meet with the oxygen it needs to create the flame front. There could be virtually no flame located in the room while large flames sweep the outside of the structure.\nAs a side note to that last example, the reason the flames exist outside the building instead of inside can be attributed to the fact that the vaporization of solid fuels creates an area of higher pressure within the enclosure, forcing the fuel out of any openings.\nI could talk about this topic all day.\nSource: Fire Protection Engineer\n", "id": "cyc1kko"}, {"comment": "Yes.

He ended up having to bite the shit out of the donkey's ear until it gave up and stopped fighting. It was ok with him after that. Anytime it got cocky my dad would point at it's ear and it would chill. Guess it was just some dominance thing. I asked my dad why in the hell did you bite his ear. He said he was afraid if he let go of the donkey's head it would have biten his testicle off the way it was twisting. So yeah I can understand the ear bite after that.

The football is a fickle beast."], [171, "There's a great story in (now-U.S. Senator) Al Franken's book *Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot* about this.  The photo, as best I can tell, seems pretty clearly from Renaissance Weekend, which is (was?) a gathering of rich influential people on the South Carolina coast (I think Hilton Head) every New Year's.  \n\nOne summer, Franken says, he came up with a brilliant play for the annual touch football game at Renaissance Weekend that involved the president.  His wife kept pointing out the million reasons it would never happen.  But Al Franken kept dreaming.\n\nAnd he pulled it off.  He just so happened to get on the president's team at the touch football game the following New Year's.  A ways into the game, Franken went into the huddle and said, \"Mr. President... I have a play.\"  Everyone looked at him, confused.  When you're playing touch football with the president, you don't call the plays.  The president calls the plays.\n\nNonetheless, they let Franken QB the next play.  \"OK everyone,\" he called out.  \"Anyone who blocks a pass intended for the president gets to spend the weekend in the Lincoln bedroom.\"  As Franken tells it, the president, confused, said \"What?!\" which Franken thinks sealed the deal.\n\nSo Franken is hiked the ball and he goes back to pass.  The president goes out deep, Franken rears back for a long pass, and ... fakes the throw.\n\nAs I remember word-for-word from the book, \"They ALL went for it.\"  Franken then made a quick toss to some athletic kid, who was being defended by literally no one, as everyone else was covering the president on the other side of the field.  The kid caught the ball and had no problem jogging into the end zone.  Exactly as planned.\n\nSo next time you play touch football with the president, keep this play in mind.

His wife kept pointing out the million reasons it would never happen.  But Al Franken kept dreaming.\n\nAnd he pulled it off.  He just so happened to get on the president's team at the touch football game the following New Year's.  A ways into the game, Franken went into the huddle and said, \"Mr. President... I have a play.\"  Everyone looked at him, confused.  When you're playing touch football with the president, you don't call the plays.  The president calls the plays.\n\nNonetheless, they let Franken QB the next play.  \"OK everyone,\" he called out.  \"Anyone who blocks a pass intended for the president gets to spend the weekend in the Lincoln bedroom.\"  As Franken tells it, the president, confused, said \"What?!\" which Franken thinks sealed the deal.\n\nSo Franken is hiked the ball and he goes back to pass.  The president goes out deep, Franken rears back for a long pass, and ... fakes the throw.\n\nAs I remember word-for-word from the book, \"They ALL went for it.\"  Franken then made a quick toss to some athletic kid, who was being defended by literally no one, as everyone else was covering the president on the other side of the field.  The kid caught the ball and had no problem jogging into the end zone.  Exactly as planned.\n\nSo next time you play touch football with the president, keep this play in mind.

Chest finners would strut and show off their glorious fin as though it were a badge of honor.  The finless would mock and laugh at the finners, who are conveniently too stupid to understand any of the ridicule.\n\nBeyond that, the finners would have a heirarchy amongst themselves determined by chest fin size.  All finners above the finless, of course, but there would be a great misconception that chest fin size is strongly tied to reproductive capability and masculinity.\n\nOne day a little chest finnie would venture too far from his pod and find himself alone and in the crosshairs of a great white.  A dramatic chase scene would ensue and just before finding safety the great white takes one last bite at the little dolphin and takes his chest fin completely off.  The little finnie is devastated.  He is ostracized from the finned community, which has been thrown into anarchy by an evil chest finner who has secretly been using an FED, commonly known as a Fin-Enhancing Drug.
