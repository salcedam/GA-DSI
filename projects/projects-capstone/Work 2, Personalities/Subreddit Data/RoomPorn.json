Yes, I suppose they limit the selection - there's no nonsense like Frontier or Spirit, but only because they know it'll cost more to get me and my bags where I'm going than if they just booked me on a regular airline.  I have zero latitude in type of seat.  There's no length of flight that qualifies me for business class, or even economy plus.

They'd spend far less on my air travel.  But the way they have it set up is such that I am incentivized to have it cost them more money. As a result I make it as expensive as possible for them.

Dump this meme right now, please? I don't mean to be rude to you in particular but this is just getting so old.\n\nOne sign of the failing middle class in the US is that there are fewer and fewer options targeted at middle-class consumers. Very broadly speaking there used to be something closer to a continuum of product and service offerings with low, middle and high-end offerings. Advertising reflected this as well, with lower-end marketing emphasizing the low cost, medium-end marketing emphasizing things like relevant features and/or reliability, and high-end offerings emphasizing style and prestige. (Insert hand-wavy comment about how this wasn't true for everything, of course there were exceptions, yadda yadda. The broader point still stands.)\n\nNowadays there's very little marketing or product design aimed at that middle tier. You can claim the reasons for it are legitimate/inevitable/beneficial if you want (I don't agree but whatevs) but it's definitely true that that market segment has been largely phased out.\n\nWhen people are ranting about airline bullshit what I believe is in the subtext is that they're angry about the lack of that middle tier. Increasingly air travel is available in one of two options:\n\n1) So-called \"Budget\" level where you are nickel and dimed to death, making it incredibly difficult to compare different options, service shrinks further and further without costs coming down, and where in general you are treated as cattle.\n\n2) Ultra high-end luxury at a cost 5x-50x that of the budget offering, where there are no a la carte fees and the airline treats you like a person.\n\nWhere's the middle tier? Where can I spend not-rock-bottom prices but not get the princess treatment? I have money I'm willing to spend over and above budget tier, but I can't afford ultra high-end luxury. Yes, I can buy budget and a la carte my way up, but then I have essentially no way of comparing airline A to airline B without a complicated and ever-shifting matrix of base offering and what is essentially airline DLC (not an accident I know). And even there it doesn't soothe my seething frustration that I know goddamned well how much I've been paying for air travel over the last 20 years so don't try to spout nonsense about prices dropping or oil costs increasing that don't match reality, don't lecture me on oil futures or the way airlines buy fuel, and don't scold me about the higher security costs.\n\nI'm well aware of all of it, and none of it addresses what - again  is at the root of customer frustration. Airlines make it very difficult for middle-class consumers to feel like their needs are being met, in fact the entire trend seems to be to claim everyone wants budget-only offerings while customers scream the opposite, and against this backdrop airlines cut services (migrating them to fees) while overall the prices stay right where they were. $400 to fly to Chicago yesterday will be $400 to fly to Chicago tomorrow, only there'll be a bag fee, a seat selection fee, a \"you're over 5 feet tall and need leg room\" fee, a meal fee, a drink fee, etc.", "id": "da1t5bd"}, {"comment": "You are oblivious.

I personally love tons of natural light, so I couldn't do all Opti5.\n\nIf the E&W windows share a room with N or S windows, you could use the dark stuff with minimal effect on the natural light and save a ton on cooling. From what I've seen of the customers bid sheets, Opti5 is the best value, the main perk of PR40 is that you can barely see it. Opti5 and other reflective films are more effective, thanks to the reflective material.

But the joke could have been equally referencing the pettiness of some of these housing agencies...it's not okay to build something new--perhaps something 'new' but fitting with the aesthetic of the neighbourhood, for example--but it is okay to renovate an existing home until it doesn't resemble itself or anything from the time period. In that sense it's weird to call it historic just because the framing is made of the same old timber. \n\nI've heard similar stories about houses in LA. You can't renovate more than 50% of the home without requiring a building permit (which neighbours will try to interfere with you getting, since they're all wealthy and don't want all that noise, etc. brought into their gated communities), so people just renovate exactly 50% of the house and do the other 50% immediately after the first half is completed. No idea how common this is, but I've seen contractors post about it several times on Reddit now.\n\nAs for the downvotes, I'm from NA and now live in Europe. I know it can sound smug when people laugh at a 100 year old home being historic, but it really does blow my mind how the western parts of Canada/America have very little history predating 100-150 years. If you're from a place where 300-1000 years is old, 100 years seems like nothing. And it's not only true, it's also what makes western NA unique. I see no shame in it, but that's just me. I don't know why people always assume Europeans are being smug when they point this out, in my experience they are often just fascinated by it. Chalk it up to feeling sensitive about a so-called 'lack' of history, I guess, which for some reason comes with all this other baggage that is completely irrelevant: a lack of culture or social identity, less architectural beauty, the idea that younger history is lesser history, and so on. None of which follows, it's just either North Americans being overly sensitive in inferring these things, or asshole Europeans implying them. But 95% of the time I don't think this is the sentiment that's being communicated. Rather, I think it's mostly amazement; don't forget that much of Europe was substantially rebuilt after both of the World Wars, less than 100 years ago. To them, a lot of that rebuilding is still very new. So it's weird to see those two perspectives in the west: a 100 year old home in Germany is a post-war rebuild, but it's an historic home in Alberta or California. That is amazing, no?

But having lived in both places...man, the distance thing really doesn't translate. I don't know if it's a joke perpetuated by tourists or what, but the way I conceive of distance in NA is totally different from how I conceive of it in Europe. \n\nFor one thing, the density is so much different over here. It's kind of like imaging traveling 10 miles in the country (i.e. it feels like it's just down the road) or 10 miles in the city (i.e. the other side of town, which feels very far away). Even assuming there's no significant obstacles to impede your travel in the city (like rush hour traffic), that 10 miles just feels way further away because you're passing like 200 business, various residential districts, probably alternating modes of transportation, and so on. That's the analogy that stuck with my NA brain when I first started living over here and tried to pin down why distance suddenly felt so different.  \n\nBut the other thing is just the history. Much of Europe was laid out before the car, when the 'town over' could be like a 3 hour walk away. So traveling by car, you're just going through town after town in a matter of minutes, all of which have different histories, different names, etc. You can do a funny thing with google maps: focus on a random area of Canada that looks like it has a lot of water (northern Quebec, for instance) and just keep zooming in. Notice how more and more lakes appear as you keep scrolling? Mind boggling. In the same way, you can centre your map on the UK and and watch more and more town names appear as you scroll, some of which seem super close together. Also mind boggling, but in a different way.

If OP reads this, I think your place could benefit from some personalization. Get some art (in frames, for the love of Pete, to stop the dorm feel!) and get it up on the walls.

[Some interesting wall pieces](http://imgur.com/8LeA1ni) (maybe not that big, but you get the idea) - something angular or geometric to go along with the style of the room. Get a plant!! I think it's called [Snake Plant](http://imgur.com/0KFC7FQ) but it's very angular and spiky and a tall one in a brushed metal pot or a concrete pot would look amazing in this space. [Get a new couch](http://imgur.com/bBWribt). It might be comfy, but it's hideous. And my couch is hideous, so I know about hideous couches. The one I linked is technically a futon, but it's much more fitting for your space than the one you have, without sacrificing the plush back or sides. I know people piss on throw pillows, but a throw pillow in white faux fur and maybe one with a subtle native or again, geometric print would be good. Or a [thick knitted throw](http://imgur.com/cPuFNa9) on the back of the aforementioned new couch. ~~I'll edit again with what I mean~~ , but that would soften the place a little without distracting from the modern and clean look of the room. In other words, get some accents that make it look like you live in a badass NYC apartment instead of the student housing at the local private college... :-) \n\nFinal Edit: And yeh, I'm totally aware that that's like, thousands and thousands of dollars for the updates I put up there (except the plant, that's like $12, yo) but with a view like that, I'll happily spend some of your dollars to create a cool modern space in my head :)", "id": "d21oufg"}, {"comment": "This is a very small portion of my entire apartment.

IIRC, it was thought to be unhealthy.\n\nThe purpose of a kitchen has changed, too.  It used to be that the dinnerware, cups, etc. were stored in a pantry near the dining room.

And after detailing an impressive list of fully-fabricated weightlifting stats, she agrees to relax with a glass of wine while I clean up.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI rush up to the shower and get to work detoxing my undercarriage, but I immediately encounter an issue. The crappy residue is so intensely CEMENTED onto my asshole-and-related-etcetera that a simple wipe with a washcloth won't clean it! It needs to be savagely sheared off with a direct stream of scalding hot water!  \n\n\nMy shower being the fixed-head type, as opposed to the kind with the freely-movable nozzle, quickly presents another problem: The only way to allow the water absolute access to my asshole would be to bend over fully and part my cheeks completely, as if I were a female panda (pandess?) in heat, presenting myself to a horny alpha-male.  \n\n\nI gulp, glance through the shower glass at my companion lounging on a seat below, and see she has her back turned as she browses Instagram on her phone.  \n\n\nI realize this is my chance and quickly assume the position!\n\n&nbsp;\n \n \n\nThe sensation of the steaming water decrusting my disgusting anus is as incredible as it is instantaneous!  \n\n\nAnd that's when I hear it! *A violent screech*! I turn to see my companion staring directly up at me, her eyes wide with horror as her gaze locks onto the chunky brown waterfall exploding from betwixt my buttocks!  \n\n\nI know I have to say something, *anything*, to try and salvage the night, but for whatever reason, the only thing my brain can force my lips to utter is an oddly-aggressive, \"***YOU SEE SOMETHIN' YOU WANNA BUY, BITCH, OR YOU JUST BROWSIN'???***\"  (To this day, I'm still unsure why I yelled the words with a thick, New York accent.)\n\n\nAnd just like that, my evening comes to an end.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFuck my shower.\n", "id": "d77of48"}, {"comment": "I'm very proud of you for writing this.", "id": "d77pfvo"}, {"comment": "That's hypothetically nasty", "id": "d77op99"}, {"comment": "> Fuck my shower.\n\nThis was not your shower's fault.", "id": "d77rj76"}, {"comment": "Dude, the shower clear made him into a panda woman that wanted hot water im the anus.

I might be confusing it with another camp as my parents made sure we went somewhere every year for an extended period of time (3 to six weeks to 3 months).

Good times. \nThere is a trail that leads to Pretty Place from camp, called The Quote Trial I believe. It has inspirational quotes along the way.

I might have to ask my parents about the different camps I went to as I think some of these were from another camp (in South Carolina?)\n\n\nThere was another part about crossing ropes (I see they still do it in these pictures) but we didn't have any safety hooks or nets.

You would cross two ropes that were parallel (one for your feet and the other for hands) and the counselors would shake it trying to fuck you up. if you fell, you'd fall in some mud.\n\nThen there was small wooden logs to cross over that stuck out from the muddy swamp.

Yet look at the end of that table. It is too large for just one person and too small for two.  \n  \nPanoramic windows are a wonderful idea. In this picture though, it seems like people would need to stand in a line to appreciate it. \"Lets look at Nature\" is the theme, but where are the fittings *inside* for plants *inside* the home? Why didn't they use the wonderful, local slate to continue Nature into the home?\n  \nWhy isn't the cooker on the side of the house with the view, where those white cabinets are?

Also, with glass such a big part of the construction, there really ought to have been a greenhouse included somewhere.

I'd recommend driving to the Mont Sainte Odile to enjoy the mystical stillness of the place and the view, then parking at the Hungerplatz on the way down the mountain and walking to the Ch\u00e2teau du Spesbourg.

It's the Westernmost Nazi concentration camp. It closes from Christmas to the end of February.\n\nWintertime isn't the best season to venture through the woods from castle to castle though and the mountain roads can be slippery.\n\nThey aren't my thing, but some people might enjoy driving south from the Christmas market in Strasbourg to Christmas markets in the Haut-Rhin.\n\nColmar is quite nice, I really like the Mus\u00e9e d'Unterlinden.

We'd have to cool the house with individual units and in the case of this house, it'd be like trying to extinguish a fire with a squirt gun. 2) Power outages are common enough that we often go without air conditioning, and even with a generator we wouldn't want to overload the power supply with cooling. 3) Yeah, my maid could clean this glass... but I'm not going to want her cleaning it all the time and peering into the house. 4) If you have staff quarters (common for wealthier people living in countries with cheap labor), they're going to be able to see inside your house which is annoying 5) The water here is hard and would require so much diligence to ensure the glass wouldn't look grimey. 6) If we hired outside window cleaners, it would be a big safety risk because there aren't the same labor practices--they'd literally be swinging from the windows without proper equipment... which ultimately means liability for us.\n\nAnyway, I don't know why I spent so much time on this, but there we have it.", "id": "d7q3hgg"}, {"comment": "I think some of these issues are much more relevant in India than in Malaysia. \n\n> there aren't reliable central HVAC suppliers \n\nNot a problem.\n\n> Power outages are common enough\n\nIn KL I experienced a few hours per year of power outage, not a big deal. \n\n> they'd literally be swinging from the windows without proper equipment... which ultimately means liability for us.\n\nIn Malaysia you just deport the maid if they get hurt!

", "id": "d7g6r0l"}, {"comment": "> Are you serious? I've probably read more of the bible than you have, and no it most def does not spend alot of time dedicated to temple architecture.\n\nI've read the whole Bible all the way through several times plus multiple commentaries. I'm considering - and training to - go into ministering at a Presbyterian Church.\n\nRight off the bat if you'd read very far into the Bible at all then you should have noticed - while valiantly struggling to slog through - the description of the Tabernacle found in Exodus 25-31. The construction of the Tabernacle takes up a further 5 chapters in Exodus 35-40. The temple is also central to the book of Leviticus and is framed with one of the last verses of Exodus 40:35 \"Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.\" and then Numbers begins \"The Lord spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting (the Tabernacle) in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt.\" So you have 1.5/5 books of the Torah centred on this idea of how the Temple comes to represent the nature of the relationship between humanity and God.\n\nYou also have a substantial explanation of the Temple of Solomon and how it relates to the Garden of Eden in 1 Kings 5-8. The temple is also mentioned more times than I'd care to mention in the prophetic works.\n\nSo maybe our definitions of \"a lot of time are different\", but actually if you're talking about pure bulk of writing the Bible spends more time talking about Temple architecture than it does about any given moral commandment.\n\n> My point is that (giving/caring to the poor) is what the foundation of CHRISTianity is.\n\nThe foundation of Christianity is something that I wouldn't boldly proclaim. But the upshot of it is:\n\n* God is holy.\n\n* Humanity is not.\n\n* Humanity cannot be with God.\n\n* Christ died so that we can be with God.\n\nIs helping the poor important? Of course, but if you tell someone that's the foundation of Christianity then you're giving them a big helping of bad theology.\n\nAlso this is literally just a prism with stained glass. Stay clear of Catholic Churches or you might have a heart attack. The Church I go to started off in my Pastor's living room and only recently managed to upgrade out of a local primary school, so maybe the Joel Olsteen comparisons are a little premature.", "id": "d7g85sd"}, {"comment": "Lol at this joker quoting Exodus.

Consumption-based economies NEVER get jumpstarted by the consummerism of mega-high classes.\n\nWhat would also inject money into the economy for contractors is building a Museum or a School in the same spot that everyone in the community gets to use, for example.\n\nAgain, many very capitalist countries have strict laws about \"abandonism\", where you cannot just leave prime habitable land sitting there abandoned for no purpose, if you own a prime piece of land you should inhabit it or rent it. I agree that you should be able to whatever you want with your property, but not in the specific case of land, since land is a communitary resource first, a very scarce one at that.\n\nAnd, no, It's not going the \"Venezuela way\", I'm not talking about expropriating them outright, which is what Venezuela did, I'm talking about proposing stricter zoning and homing laws so we can use our prime living land more efficiently and fairly.\n\nAlso, Real Estate is mostly a speculative business that creates little to no value, so I would question that \"increasing the value of homes\" is actually doing jack squat for the economy. It's fake liquidity and fake growth, there is nothing of value actually entering or leaving the economy, it's just flipping and speculating.", "id": "d9h15tk"}, {"comment": "Why wouldn't there be a party?", "id": "d9e40gn"}, {"comment": "Wait for the party to start.", "id": "d9e3fwd"}], [{"comment": "Jesus christ", "id": "d9dy24l"}, {"comment": "You said it, man!\n", "id": "d9dyvgr"}, {"comment": "12 year olds, dude", "id": "d9eu9me"}, {"comment": "Thats a pretty space", "id": "d9eg0z1"}], [{"comment": "https://youtu.be/NttlPwNKd_M", "id": "d9e0idh"}], [{"comment": "He's (Goldstein) gifted it to the LACMA as a work of art.

James Goldsten, a rich business man bought the house in 1972. John Lautner was again commissioned, this time by Goldstein, to make major renovations. Thus the house got its name from the previous and current owners.\n\n\nJohn Lautner is my favorite architect. For anyone that loves architecture, Google image his name and enjoy scrolling through all his beautiful works. He was like an alternate version of Frank Lloyd Wright if Frank Lloyd Wright had an infatuation with outer space. His buildings are very recognizable and many of the houses he built were used as film sets. Obviously the most famous one is Jackie Treehorn's room from the Big Lebowski. The same room is featured in a music video by Pharrell and Snoop Dogg. Can't remember the name of the song. His other two most famous buildings are probably the Elrod House, which was used as the home for a James Bond villain, and Chemosphere, an LA home that resembles a flying saucer. Chemosphere has been parodied and referenced numerous times in pop culture. The Simpsons did it. \n\n\n\nThis perfect room.\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IsrNRQZ.jpg\n\n\n\nThis kitchen/library/loft is incredible. I think I like it more than than Jackie Treehorn's room.
