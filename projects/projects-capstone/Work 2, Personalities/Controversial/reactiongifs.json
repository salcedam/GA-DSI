Syria has a bunch of oil pipelines that lead to both Russia and Europe, so it's a strategic stronghold. Clinton could get us into war with Russia over Syria and that could easily escalate to WW3.

You know what's going to happen after this election? Those of us who are reasonable people will be lumped in with the actual racist idiots.  Anyone who mentions being against political correctness will be considered racist.

What does socialism really mean? If people have something to eat and their pleasures, then they have their socialism.\"[12] In private, Hitler also said that \"I absolutely insist on protecting private property... we must encourage private initiative\".\n\nAnd one of the primary reasons antisemitism was so prevalent was ***because*** of it's connections to Marxist-Socialism, via the recent Russian Revolution by the Bolsheviks.  See the antisemitic dog-whistles \"[Jewish Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Bolshevism),\"  and \"[Cultural Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Bolshevism),\" which became \"Cultural Marxism\" after the war to hide it's antisemitic foundation from a world weary about hating jews, which some politicians and demagogue still openly use.\n\nAnyways, It's odd that this debate keeps popping up.  The Economic policies were not the things that people take issue with when it comes to Hitler and the Nazi's.

Personally, I believe he doesn't have that ability, so while I may really like Bernie for his ideas, I'll likely vote Hillary because she can beat either Republican.", "id": "d1hqd5y"}, {"comment": "No we don't. Liberalism is not a straight line to progress, with left equaling movement forward. The left does not automatically mean the better ideas or options, I say this as a democrat myself. \n\nWe're not Bankrupt at all. I don't know where you even have that idea. The United States is the worlds number one economy still and will remain as such for a long time. Debt is not, and I repeat **Not**, a bad thing. The debt of the United States is what allows the world economy to move forward in the first place, with the PRC buying the majority of it for the interest. The dollar is still the king currency of the world and continues to be used the most out of any currency.  \n\nOur doctors and hospitals are some of the best in the world, availability of health care is limited but we're working on that. I wouldn't go as far as to say worst without a source. We don't need a far left person to deal with this, we just need a directed approach from both parties led by a president that can bully congress.\n\nMass shootings are a freak occurrence and most gun crimes that happen would not be stopped with increased gun regulation. Shootings are blown out of proportion and the public eats it up like a hog with it's own shit. Should there be some more reasonable laws for mental illness and guns? Yes, but availability is hardly the issue, with most crimes involving simple hand guns. We don't need a socialist for this, just someone that is willing to tackle mental illness.\n\nYeah, the for profit prison system is a bit much but the pure fact of the matter is that once populations increase so do problems and the more difficult it is to handle it. New problem arise that were never present at smaller scales, the US for example has the 3rd largest population of any nation on earth. It's easy to forget some times just how many people the US has. \n\nThe US is the greatest country on earth, not the best, there is a difference. It has the greatest economy, military, political power,and other things. Is it the best nation? Best is subjective. The power of the nation is greater than any other nation or group of nations. No one that gets elected will change that.  Remember that the president cannot draft bills, that he can only influence the passage of bills and push congress to draft them. To push congress you need to have friends in congress and be able to intimidate people to get what you want, the honey and stick. Bernie Sanders is not a democrat and has made a lot of enemies among the establishment, the establishment that controls the houses of governance. Bernie Sanders does not have it in him to intimidate anyone in congress, nor does he have the friendships to get it through that way. This would be a challenge if his ideas were slightly more moderate but with the radicalness of his idea is downright near impossible. He among the current candidates has the *worst* chance of working with the nonoperative congress he would have, him and Ted Cruz. We need someone that can bully congress when needed, someone that can offer economic and foreign policy experience. \n\nWhat nation do you come from?", "id": "d1gzfc9"}, {"comment": "America is not perfect but we're not any better or worse than the rest of the first-world nations out there.

We have a lot of contradictions, but there's still a lot to love. It's a shame you don't see that.\n\nAnd FWIW, the reason liberals often have to find themselves making practical choices for someone like Hillary instead of someone we might like *more* like Bernie is because the right wing in this country becomes scarier every day.

Today, a year later, his product is in more than 1,600 stores. His business is growing at an astonishing pace.\n\nQuinn took his nascent idea to a cousin who is a mechanical engineer.\n\n'We started making tweaks and changes to the medical casting tape, until we had made it something new,' he said.\n\nThe new product is more dense, with a stronger knit and resin, and has been designed to adhere to wood, metal and plastic. The tape is cold and heat resistant, non-toxic and hardens like steel.\n\n'The weave is really tight, so it is waterproof,' Quinn said.\n\nSausage: http://www.heraldextra.com/business/local/byu-student-strikes-gold-with-fiber-tape/article_41c543b0-1f83-5da4-92de-f9042f8e94fe.html\n\nLooks like it started off as casting tape, but has been improved to be stronger and more versatile!

Removing borders could do wonders for our healthcare system. I don't think it's as good as a real NHS, but it's still 'something.' As a man, I've seen my rates more than triple. $6,000 for when it kicks in on my 'gold plan.'\n\nCruz wants to increase H1-B's, and my IT friends are gonna get hammered by this as it undercuts wages.

No. They're far from it.** But at least he correctly analyzes what problems we face as a country, whereas Cruz and Hillary are likely paid well to not bring such subject matter to the fore.

And it's been going that way for awhile.  I mean even as early as the 90's you had games like Chrono Trigger giving you the option of having a turn-based system where it's truly turn-based and there's an order -- or having one where enemies have their own timers and will continue attacking even if you don't use your turns.\n\nBased on what little we could see from the gameplay trailer it seems like the battle menus are still in there -- chances are all of the characters not controlled by the player are just operating off conditions you set for them -- to be defensive/support/attack, whatever.\n\nHonestly I think the perfect solution to this would simply be a pause system akin to the old Black Isle games -- if you played them in real time, your party would act on their own based on their styles unless you paused the game and queued up actions for each character.  \n\n", "id": "cxps5vg"}], [{"comment": "Yeah this sucks.

Plus, a history that suggests good things to a high enough % of the populace. Among other things.\n\n___\n\nI agree that he won't end up doing most of what he claims he'll do though. I think the more legitimate fear is the damage having a president like Trump will do to the US's already ill repute abroad. He is not only a clearly a bad foreign policy choice, but is also viewed as ridiculous by even other first world countries we're allied with.\n\nI'm sure it still wouldn't be the end of the world, but it still would suck having another \"cowboy\" character for everyone to make fun of.

I know that he'll have massive amounts of people around him ensuring he avoids things like this but it's a red flag to me that in the heat of the moment he might lose his cool.  \n\nThe biggest problem is that he seems to openly welcome racism and islamophobia which could cause even more heat for the US in a time when we really need to focus on globalization compared to isolation. He's seemingly trying to pin the country against Mexicans (one of 2 bordered countries) and Muslims; who make up nearly 1/3 of the planet's population and who have within their religion (not exclusively) the world's worst terrorists. So by extension he's pissing off not only a huge amount of the world but also ISIS. I'm well aware that the US has the ability to face any of these threats through their pure military force alone but I think economically causing potential expenses like this are not an ideal situation when the world has been in a recession for years. I have a gut feeling that if Trump is elected it makes the country much more vulnerable to criticism and attack. \n\nI also can't imagine him being very diplomatic with another powerful ego like Putin. Again, maybe all his outrageousness is just a ploy to get the attention of voters but I'm just basing my opinion off of his campaign and what we've seen from him in the past. \n\nI'd also like to note that I'm from Canada so this is just my outside opinion, so no one should take it too seriously.

It wouldn't be as dramatic as having trade cut off but I think that any hindrance right now could be seriously detrimental as the state of the economy is still in the recovery stage.
