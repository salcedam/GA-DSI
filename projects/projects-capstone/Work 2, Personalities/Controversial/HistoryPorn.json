They were engaged at the Chicago Theatre,[46] and married on January 26, 1940, at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather church in Glendale, California.[47] Together they had two biological children, Maureen (1941\u20132001) and Christine (who was born in 1947 but only lived one day), and adopted a third, Michael (born 1945).[48] After arguments about Reagan's political ambitions, Wyman filed for divorce in 1948,[49] citing a distraction due to her husband's Screen Actors Guild union duties; the divorce was finalized in 1949.[23] He is the only US president to have been divorced.[50] Reagan and Wyman continued to be friends until his death, with Wyman voting for Reagan in both of his runs and, upon his death, saying \"America has lost a great president and a great, kind, and gentle man.\"[51]\nRonald and Nancy Reagan aboard a boat in California in 1964\n\nReagan met actress Nancy Davis (born 1921)[52] in 1949 after she contacted him in his capacity as president of the Screen Actors Guild to help her with issues regarding her name appearing on a Communist blacklist in Hollywood. She had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis. She described their meeting by saying, \"I don't know if it was exactly love at first sight, but it was pretty close.\"[53] They were engaged at Chasen's restaurant in Los Angeles and were married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley.[54] Actor William Holden served as best man at the ceremony. They had two children: Patti (born October 21, 1952) and Ron (born May 20, 1958).\n\nObservers described the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate.[55] During his presidency they were reported to frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, \"They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting.\"[53][56] He often called her \"Mommy\" and she called him \"Ronnie.\"[56] He once wrote to her, \"Whatever I treasure and enjoy ... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you.\"[57] When he was in the hospital in 1981, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent.[58] In a letter to U.S. citizens written in 1994, Reagan wrote \"I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience,\"[53] and in 1998, while Reagan was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, \"Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did.

Because I was asked to provide proof of Patton's stance on the Soviets.  I didn't supply a bibliography because that quote should be enough to provide Patton's stance. \n\nAs to the Soviets capabilities in 1945, according to a website dedicated to WW2 weapons and production, the Soviets  produced 19.4 tons of crude oil. The US produced 227 tons.Between 39-45, the Russians produced 71.3 million tons of steel. The US produced 397 million tons of steel. I'll check in the Russians reserves but their production was nowhere in the US/UK's league. The Soviets production abilities for things like oil went up in the late 1940s and 50s but that's because they confiscated a ton of oil fields in Eastern Europe. \n\nThe Soviets didn't become net oil exporters until they confiscated oil fields in places like Austria after ww2. (According to David Painter). Until 1974, the US led the world in crude oil exports. In 1945, the Soviets would have had to deal with the US/UK's ability to dominant crude oil and rubber. Both integral to mechanized warfare and airfare. ~~Artificial rubber would not be created until the 1950s by a Catholic priest in Indiana~~. The Germans are a good example of how a lack of oil and rubber can cause huge issues. My apologies, Fr.Nieuwland and a man from DuPont created Neoprene in the 1930s but it was not popular as it had a strong odor. Further refinement of the process would make it cheaper and better smelling.\n\nPost Soviet records have shown guys like Krushchev admit the US's ability was integral to their war effort. In Great Patriotic War documentation from the state it was played down because, by then, the US were the enemy. So, while I'm sure the Soviets had reserves, their ability to hang with the US/UK in supply and logistics even in 1945 was comparing a dwarf to Yao Ming. \n\nFrom poking around the internet, in 1945 the Americans had 8X the oil reserves of the Soviets. The USSR's Aluminum for airplanes came from the UK and US. The US dominated Aluminum production at the time. Some Soviets were still using biplanes. Soviet horse units would not be fully disbanded until the mid 1950s. Soviet Trucks and Trains were predominantly supplied by the US/UK. In 1943, the US produced 834.8 thousand tons of aluminum. The USSR procured 62.3 thousands tons. Between '42 and '43, the US doubled production of aluminum. In the same time period, the USSR output went from 51.7 to 62.3.\n\nThe Soviets provided a wee bit over 2 million in support to the US during WW2. The Americans and UK provided them over 11 Billion. Which, according to an inflation calculator, is about 150 Billion today. All told, the US and UK provided 760 Billion in todays dollars of materials and supplies to allied nations.\n\nAlso, found an interesting site where they have German officers interviewed and asked why Germany lost.

Hood Co. that Gordon Cutler delivered milk door-to-door, but his blood ran thick with the brand that springs from human kindness.\n\nCutler, who died at 91 on Saturday in Lowell, was the sort of man everybody liked, said Mary Cutler, his wife of 68 years. \"He helped people and enjoyed it.\"\nAn Arlington native, Cutler delivered milk in Lowell for more than 40 years, and was the first milkman in the area to use a motorized milk wagon. Undaunted by the flood of 1936, he made deliveries to Lowell's Little Canada section by rowboat.\n\n\nHis determination and empathy for others was hard-won. It was taking to the water at 14 that changed Cutler's life from a sad what-could-have-been to a life of delivering more than milk.\nAfter his parents separated, Cutler lived with his grandmother in Arlington. He attended Tilton Academy, but dropped out at 14 and headed to New York, where his father lived. There, he felt unwanted by his stepmother and made do as he could.\n\n\nOne day, he woke up in a flophouse in New York's Bowery section as it was being raided by police. At that moment, Gordon Cutler told himself, I can take two paths in life.\n\n\nUnhappy with the road he was on, he walked out, enlisted in the Merchant Marine and went to sea for a year.\nHe headed to Fryeburg Academy in Fryeburg, Maine, painting a church steeple and waiting tables to earn his way. Summers, he'd head to sea again with the Merchant Marine. He graduated in 1927, and earned a basketball scholarship to Clark University. He wanted to practice law, but when the Depression hit his scholarship dried up, and he was forced to leave school.\n\n\n\"He decided he would be better off with an empty head but a full stomach,\" said Mary Cutler.\nHe moved to Lowell and began working for Hood, starting with a wholesale delivery route, then a retail route.\nEarly in his tenure, his route included a stop at Betty's Tearoom, at the corner of John and Merrimack streets, where he met Mary Hebb.\n\n\nAfter they married on Feb. 8, 1934, he used to say Mary was the first real family he'd ever had. They had three children of their own.\n\n\nHe delivered more than cold bottles of milk. The Depression lingered. \"Mr. Cutler,\" some on the route would say, \"we can't pay you this week, so don't leave anything.\" He'd leave them milk anyway, and some of the money would come out of his paycheck. He couldn't stand the idea of kids going without milk.\n\"He used to say, 'I made only $19 a week delivering milk, but a lot of people had nothing,'\" said his son, Bill Cutler, who lives in Arizona.\n\n\nHe accepted other forms of payment.\n\"People would raise canaries,\" said Mary. \"We'd have three or four in the house at a time.\"\nHe could swap routes when he got tired of them. He delivered in the city, but also \"in the country Chelmsford, Westford,\" his widow said. One family was so upset by his departure they wrote to Hood and asked that Cutler be made to stay.\n\n\nHe was delivering milk in Belvidere when he got the city's first milk truck. There were too many deliveries, and the load was too heavy for horses.\n\n\nWhen Hood stopped door-to-door deliveries, he took a job at Hood's office on Walker Street. When the office closed in 1973, they offered him a job in Boston.\nNah, he said, it's been more than 40 years. I'm 62. Enough.\n\"He'd tell people, 'The truck died, the cow dried up and I quit,'\" said his daughter, Mary Jane Mayotte.\nAnd 16 years ago, the Cutlers moved from their nine-room home on Wilder Street and in with Mary Jane and her husband, Paul, a few blocks away, where Gordon Cutler spent a lot of time with his grandkids and occasionally offered up advice.\n\n\n\"He'd say, 'No matter what hardships are in your way, there's a right course of action to take,\"' said his daughter.\n\nEDIT - got rid of wall of text", "id": "d8tkdqv"}, {"comment": "Argh this is making me tear up", "id": "d8tprmg"}, {"comment": "I would say yes, absolutely.", "id": "d8t24d6"}, {"comment": "Not only that, but milk provided a lot of calories and protein to these people who might have had very little food.", "id": "d8ted2y"}, {"comment": "Milk is life.

With 30-inch hips it is hard to achieve a prominent waistline (I don't have much belly fat, my waist is less than 25 inches, but I just look like a box without any curves). The other day I was just marveling at my cousin who has a higher BMI than me but her waistline is much more prominent and as a result, her figure is a perfect hourglass. It's mostly genes, you can't really alter your waist/hip ratio much (you can change the thickness of your waist but the hips, not so much, it's largely just the way your bone structure is). I'm a bit jealous of women with good waistlines, but I suppose the one thing I could always do is wear a corset.\n\nSorry for overlong comment, my point was just to say that hourglass waists are made possible by genes, but of course they also require being maintained with a healthy lifestyle.

There I am a decent speaker but my writing and reading is horrible due to the different writing system and me being too stupid to fully understand it.\n\nAt home we spoke Farsi. Outside it was Frisian and German. I also attended voluntary Frisian courses in school. This is how most immigrant children grew up where I lived. \nFrom grade 5 on we had ~6h of English classes per week. Cultural imperialism, the internet, books, games and a family spread around the globe helped to refine it.  \nThis is how I picked 4 languages up. Really nothing impressive looking at the circumstances.\n\nIf I was more intelligent and had been accepted at a tier 1 high school I would have to pick an additional language and would be at 5. Assuming I would have put as much effort into it as I did with English.\n\nI also had 1 year of Spanish and 2 years of French classes. Also studied Russian for half a year on my own. But I would never list those on a cv. I only have some basic comprehension of simple texts there. Although I am trying to learn french now to finally catch up to my friends and brothers. Who all went to proper high schools and often learned yet another language as a requirement to get their university degrees. \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMaybe I should add a little explanation of the school system in Germany. It is way more complex than that but to keep it simple:\n\nBetween grade 4 and 7 (depending in which state you live) they, depending on your intelligence, decide to which school you go. Tier 1, 2 and 3. (Sparing you the German names here.)\n\nIn tier 1 you get the best and most challenging education up until grade 12. Also they make you learn English plus another language intensively. (Usually French, Latin or Spanish). After graduation you can apply for an apprenticeship and you have earned the right to enter higher education.\n\nTier 2 gets you an okayish education and you graduate after grade 10. You don't get to pick a second language and you are not allowed to enter higher education after you graduate from it. But there are ways to remain in the school system and get a proper high school diploma.\n\nAt the end of the line you get tier 3 which is basically there to occupy the students who were just intelligent enough to not land into higher education. They only remain there until year 9 which is also the minimum of years you are required to go to school in Germany. Their diplomas are not worth the paper they are printed on but they too get the chance to earn better diplomas trough further education. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "id": "d7vo59a"}, {"comment": "If you are fluent in Farsi there are government jobs that would take you in short order.", "id": "d7vp9c2"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d7vsqa3"}, {"comment": "But why frisian?

I'm not even going to address that serfdom was a form of slavery, only the slaves were treated as fixtures to real property (like a house) instead of chattel (personal property.)

The same can be said of the abolition of slavery: adequate measures were not taken to ensure a \"soft landing,\" so to speak. Any radical reform is going to have these problems. But we also have the benefit of hindsight...\n\n> Most of the time, they didn't get land, and if they did, the plots were tiny.

They didn't \"get land\" because the land wasn't divvied up by individual or family. Instead the land was parceled into communes that the peasants basically paid \"dues\" to live and work on. The nobles were actually paid for the loss of labor *and* land that they ceded to these peasant communes.\n\n(Edit: When Stolypin's land reforms began in 1906, they were a huge success, and continued to be implemented well past his death and up to WWI. Parts of his reforms were continued by the Soviet government, though not credited to him.)\n\n> On paper, they were better off. In reality, little changed.\n\nSure, but the life of a peasant farmer isn't grandiose, and nobody was promising them the moon. Famines would still periodically take place, disease would still strike; all of this was par for the course *everywhere* until the introduction of widespread mechanization, refrigeration, vaccination, etc. The point is that serfdom was abolished, which meant that they *were* free to move to the cities if their hearts so desired.\n\nI absolutely agree with you that a better social safety net needed to be established; however, I won't concede the point that Russians were grievously worse off than their counterparts in other countries. (See below.)\n\n> And just because it was an industrial power doesn't mean much as for how bad its system was. The US was an industrial power well before 1865.\n\nThese sentences are kind of heading in different directions. The comparison to slavery is one thing, but the relative start dates of industrialization actually point to how rapid Russia's industrialization truly was after 1861. (Edit: This became more the case after 1900.) Some, including American leaders, were calling it a \"Russian miracle\" and predicting that Russia would outpace America by the 1920s. Whether this is actually would have happened or not is hard to say, but it was being said.\n\nAs for the system, Russian workers were earning comparatively more than their foreign counterparts, and the cost of goods per capita was cheaper. Labor laws were more progressive than in Europe and the U.S., and even distribution of wealth was not only far better than in Russia today (well, duh), but was even good compared to other nations at the time (more on those numbers [here](http://web.williams.edu/Economics/wp/Nafziger_Lindert_Inequality_Sept2013.pdf)). Foreign investment was off the charts, population growth was strong, Russia fed Europe with grain exports, and Russians even consumed less booze per capita than their European counterparts.\n\nImperial Russia gets a bad rap from Soviet historians first and foremost, but also from contemporary English historians anxious about an economically/militarily ascendant Russia and eager to depict the \"Land of the Tsars\" as a brutal, ignorant backwater.

Any new model of aircraft  initially has numerous problems, gradually these get ironed out, redesigned parts etc. With Concorde in the main this didn't happen. To bore you with an example. Hydraulic pumps on most civil aircraft then ran at 3000psi and had bronze cylinder blocks. Concorde was designed to run at 4000psi. Abex the pump manufacturers designed one with a thinner, lighter, cast iron block. It had a problem and cracked in service. (Not disastrous there were four separate hydraulic systems). Abex stated with the small number of Concords in service they could not justify redesigning and manufacturing a new cylinder. So Concorde kept that original pump until it retired.

So when they hit, the deformed balls don't travel through tissue very efficiently, instead transferring most of their kinetic energy to the tissue, organs and bones of the victim. And if they do pass through you, things aren't much better: In middle school, a Revolutionary War re-enactor at Yorktown told our class that contemporary accounts likened the size of musket ball exit wounds to a pomegranate or a grapefruit. \"\n\nFrom [this link](https://www.quora.com/How-deadly-are-18th-century-muskets-rifles-at-close-range).\n\nFurthermore, \"The soft lead that allowed Minie\u00b4 balls to expand within the rifle barrel also caused them to flatten out and/or splinter when they hit a human target. A smoothbore\u2019s solid shot could break bones and tear through tissue, but soft lead bullets shattered bone and ripped tissue. Overworked Civil War surgeons often had to amputate limbs wounded by Minie\u00b4 balls. Adding to the damage, some soldiers notched their bullets to insure they would spread out when they hit their target. In the 1870s, doctors urged an international ban on soft-lead bullets, saying they caused the same sort of damage as explosive bullets.\"\n\nFrom [History of the Minie Ball] (http://www.historynet.com/minie-ball).\n\nEdited with some links, and it should be noted the first link mostly addresses Revolutionary War-era firearms, which were used in the early Civil war, and the second link addresses traditional Civil War projectiles.

Owens and his black teammates enjoyed a freedom of movement and equality seldom experienced stateside. The Nazis wanted to use the Olympics to display a renewed Germany to the world. International Olympic boycott movements had threatened the opportunity. Consequently, the Olympic village was integrated and all racist propaganda was suspended for the duration of the games. Robert Vann, an African-American newsman, wrote, \u201cThese German people are mighty fine. They have a spirit of sportsmanship and fair play which overrides the color-barrier.\u201d  However, this rosy picture of Berlin in 1936 was not conducive to framing a struggle between opposed political ideologies.\n\tIn truth the tolerant Berlin on which Vann reported was created specifically for the duration of the Olympics at the behest Goebbels and the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Anti-Semitic posters and publications were removed from the streets. Buildings were white-washed and painted. Public persecution of Jewish Berliners was forbidden. Foreshadowing the terror to come, the Sinti and Roma were forcibly removed to a \u201cgypsy camp\u201d in Marzahn, a suburb of Berlin. Goebbels appealed, \u201cThe future of the Reich will depend upon the impression that is left upon our guests.\u201d  Der Angriff, the militant newspaper that eventually coined the slur \u201cblack auxiliaries\u201d for the black American Olympians, advised its readers to be \u201cmore charming than the Parisians, more easygoing than the Viennese, more vivacious than the Romans, more cosmopolitan than London, and more practical than New York.\u201d  The effort expended by the Reich to sanitize the capitol lessened the political influence of National Socialism on the Olympics Games. Instead the XI Olympiad hid the true nature of the regime\u2019s intentions. Historian Barbara Keys concluded, \u201cThe games did nothing to alter the character of the Third Reich. But the Third Reich did little to alter the character of the Olympics.\u201d \n\n**edit:** u/djangotrout asked for sources. Here you go. Not sure how to format this.

Pretty interesting story.\n\n> Speaking to Long's son, Owens said in 1964 that Long went to him and told him to try and jump from a spot several inches behind the take-off board. Since Owens routinely made distances far greater than the minimum of 7.15m required to advance, Long surmised that Owens would be able to advance safely to the next round without risking a foul trying to push for a greater distance. On his third qualifying jump, Owens was calm and jumped with at least four inches (10 centimeters) to spare, easily qualifying for the finals. In the finals competition later that day, the jumpers exceeded the old Olympic record five times.[7] Owens went on to win the gold medal in the long jump with 8.06m while besting Long's own record of 7.87m. Long won the silver medal for second place and was the first to congratulate Owens: they posed together for photos and walked arm-in-arm to the dressing room. Owens said, \"It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler... You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn't be a plating on the twenty-four karat friendship that I felt for Luz Long at that moment\".\n\n[Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luz_Long)"], [109, "What did he win this gold medal for?

The Chicago Defender remarked, \u201cAmerica\u2019s arms of welcome to Jesse Owens, world-famed track hero, Sunday night, were the arms of Jim Crow.\u201d  The Olympic champion was forced to use a service elevator to attend a banquet in his honor. Furthermore, the Great Depression contributed to historical unemployment that greatly affected the job prospects for black men in America. Not even international stardom guaranteed financial success. After prematurely leaving an American Olympic Committee fundraising tour in the wake of Berlin, Owens forfeited his track career for the promised freedom of newly found fame. Job offers had flooded the telegraph wires in Europe, but few proved substantial. Within months Owens was racing horses for peanuts. Jesse along with ghost writer Paul Neimark remembered, \u201cIt made me sick. But I did it. Why did I do it? To survive.\u201d  Fame in western society \u201chas been intertwined with ideals of personal freedom that have animated so much political, social, and economic change in the last two hundred years. The difficulty arises when to be free is defined by being known to be free, because then one might be more known than free.\u201d  Despite his stature as the man who struck a blow for freedom against fascism, the stark reality for Owens and millions of black Americans was that racial equality was, and is, a work in progress.

Owens and his black teammates enjoyed a freedom of movement and equality seldom experienced stateside. The Nazis wanted to use the Olympics to display a renewed Germany to the world. International Olympic boycott movements had threatened the opportunity. Consequently, the Olympic village was integrated and all racist propaganda was suspended for the duration of the games. Robert Vann, an African-American newsman, wrote, \u201cThese German people are mighty fine. They have a spirit of sportsmanship and fair play which overrides the color-barrier.\u201d  However, this rosy picture of Berlin in 1936 was not conducive to framing a struggle between opposed political ideologies.\n\tIn truth the tolerant Berlin on which Vann reported was created specifically for the duration of the Olympics at the behest Goebbels and the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Anti-Semitic posters and publications were removed from the streets. Buildings were white-washed and painted. Public persecution of Jewish Berliners was forbidden. Foreshadowing the terror to come, the Sinti and Roma were forcibly removed to a \u201cgypsy camp\u201d in Marzahn, a suburb of Berlin. Goebbels appealed, \u201cThe future of the Reich will depend upon the impression that is left upon our guests.\u201d  Der Angriff, the militant newspaper that eventually coined the slur \u201cblack auxiliaries\u201d for the black American Olympians, advised its readers to be \u201cmore charming than the Parisians, more easygoing than the Viennese, more vivacious than the Romans, more cosmopolitan than London, and more practical than New York.\u201d  The effort expended by the Reich to sanitize the capitol lessened the political influence of National Socialism on the Olympics Games. Instead the XI Olympiad hid the true nature of the regime\u2019s intentions. Historian Barbara Keys concluded, \u201cThe games did nothing to alter the character of the Third Reich. But the Third Reich did little to alter the character of the Olympics.\u201d \n\n**edit:** u/djangotrout asked for sources. Here you go. Not sure how to format this.

Late in the summer, Louis Reed, the regular elephant trainer, had to leave the show. Paul Jacoby, who had previously been the elephant trainer, took over the job. Eldridge had dropped into St. Paul from a Norfolk and Western boxcar, and worked some time as janitor at the Riverside Hotel. Eldridge was hired as elephant groom on the 11th of September in St. Paul, Virginia, and was killed the next day.\n \nThere are several different accounts of what actually happened that day. Between shows the elephants were driven to a watering hole. On the way back to the tent, Mary went for a piece of watermelon beside the road, and Eldridge started to punish her, but she grabbed him with her trunk.\n\nThe crowd of onlookers became furious and Blacksmith Hench Cox fired his 32-20 five times at Mary, and later Sheriff Gallahan \"knocked chips out of her hide a little\" with his .45, according to witness Bud Jones, but with little effect. People demanded the elephant to be killed, and the circus was under pressure. Leaders of several nearby towns threatened not to allow the circus to visit if Mary was included. Charlie and Addie Sparks decided that the elephant must be killed.\n \n\"A human's life is something I don't want charged against me,\" Charlie Sparks later claimed in a 1924 interview. \"If people in the business get hurt, that's our lookout. But with an outsider - that's different.\"\n \nThe circus travelled to Erwin, and Mary and the four other elephants to Clinchfield Rail Yard in the town or Erwin, headquarters of the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad, where there was a 100 ton heavy locomotive crane Derrick Car 1400, strong enough to lift her with a chain. More than 2,500 people gathered to watch Mary die. The chain from which Mary hung snapped shortly after she was raised off the ground, and she fell down on the ground, immobilized from the pain of a broken hip. A heavier chain was attached and this time she was raised into the sky. It took about ten minutes before Murderous Mary was finally dead. They left her hanging for a half-hour, witnesses say, and then, pronounced dead by a local physician, Dr. R.E. Stack, they dumped her in the grave they had dug with a steam shovel 400 feet up the tracks.\n\nExcerpts from (click here to read the rest of the story) Elephant Facts and Information Database\n \nThe Death of Sport - courtesy of James Taylor Shocked & Amazed\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you have a question you would like to submit email us at the Sideshow World.\n \n Back to the Blow-Off       Back to Main\n \nAll photos are the property of their respective owners whether titled or marked anonymous.\n\"Sideshow WorldTM\" is the sole property of John Robinson \u00a9  All rights reserved.\n sideshowworld.com   sideshowworld.org   sideshowworld.net  sideshowworld.biz   sideshowworld.info\nis the sole property of John Robinson \u00a9  All rights reserved.\nE-Mail Sideshow World     E-Mail The Webmaster"], [2, "This happened in the town I live in.

Late in the summer, Louis Reed, the regular elephant trainer, had to leave the show. Paul Jacoby, who had previously been the elephant trainer, took over the job. Eldridge had dropped into St. Paul from a Norfolk and Western boxcar, and worked some time as janitor at the Riverside Hotel. Eldridge was hired as elephant groom on the 11th of September in St. Paul, Virginia, and was killed the next day.\n \nThere are several different accounts of what actually happened that day. Between shows the elephants were driven to a watering hole. On the way back to the tent, Mary went for a piece of watermelon beside the road, and Eldridge started to punish her, but she grabbed him with her trunk.\n\nThe crowd of onlookers became furious and Blacksmith Hench Cox fired his 32-20 five times at Mary, and later Sheriff Gallahan \"knocked chips out of her hide a little\" with his .45, according to witness Bud Jones, but with little effect. People demanded the elephant to be killed, and the circus was under pressure. Leaders of several nearby towns threatened not to allow the circus to visit if Mary was included. Charlie and Addie Sparks decided that the elephant must be killed.\n \n\"A human's life is something I don't want charged against me,\" Charlie Sparks later claimed in a 1924 interview. \"If people in the business get hurt, that's our lookout. But with an outsider - that's different.\"\n \nThe circus travelled to Erwin, and Mary and the four other elephants to Clinchfield Rail Yard in the town or Erwin, headquarters of the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad, where there was a 100 ton heavy locomotive crane Derrick Car 1400, strong enough to lift her with a chain. More than 2,500 people gathered to watch Mary die. The chain from which Mary hung snapped shortly after she was raised off the ground, and she fell down on the ground, immobilized from the pain of a broken hip. A heavier chain was attached and this time she was raised into the sky. It took about ten minutes before Murderous Mary was finally dead. They left her hanging for a half-hour, witnesses say, and then, pronounced dead by a local physician, Dr. R.E. Stack, they dumped her in the grave they had dug with a steam shovel 400 feet up the tracks.\n\nExcerpts from (click here to read the rest of the story) Elephant Facts and Information Database\n \nThe Death of Sport - courtesy of James Taylor Shocked & Amazed\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you have a question you would like to submit email us at the Sideshow World.\n \n Back to the Blow-Off       Back to Main\n \nAll photos are the property of their respective owners whether titled or marked anonymous.\n\"Sideshow WorldTM\" is the sole property of John Robinson \u00a9  All rights reserved.\n sideshowworld.com   sideshowworld.org   sideshowworld.net  sideshowworld.biz   sideshowworld.info\nis the sole property of John Robinson \u00a9  All rights reserved.\nE-Mail Sideshow World     E-Mail The Webmaster", "id": "d55e7fk"}], [{"comment": "This happened in the town I live in.

He was the only doctor stationed at the Novolazarevskaya Station and, while there, developed appendicitis, which meant he had to perform an appendectomy on himself, a famous case of self-surgery.  \n  \nIn 1961, Rogozov was stationed at a newly constructed Russian base in Antarctica. The 12 men inside were cut off from the outside world by the polar winter by March of that year. On the morning of 29 April 1961, Rogozov experienced general weakness, nausea, and moderate fever, and later pain in the lower right portion of the abdomen. His symptoms were classic: he had acute appendicitis. \u201cHe knew that if he was to survive he had to undergo an operation\u201d, the British Medical Journal recounted. \u201cBut he was in the frontier conditions of a newly founded Antarctic colony on the brink of the polar night. Transportation was impossible. Flying was out of the question, because of the snowstorms. And there was one further problem: he was the only physician on the base\u201d. Rogozov wrote in his diary:  \n  \n> *\u201cIt seems that I have appendicitis. I am keeping quiet about it, even smiling. Why frighten my friends? Who could be of help? A polar explorer\u2019s only encounter with medicine is likely to have been in a dentist\u2019s chair\u201d.*  \n  \nAll the available conservative treatment was applied (antibiotics, local cooling), but the patient\u2019s general condition was getting worse: his body temperature rose, vomiting became more frequent.  \n  \n> *\u201cI did not sleep at all last night. It hurts like the devil! A snowstorm whipping through my soul, wailing like a hundred jackals. Still no obvious symptoms that perforation is imminent, but an oppressive feeling of foreboding hangs over me\u2026 This is it\u2026 I have to think through the only possible way out: to operate on myself\u2026It\u2019s almost impossible\u2026but I can\u2019t just fold my arms and give up\u201d.*  \n  \nRogozov had no option but to perform the operation on himself. The operation started at 02:00 local time on the first day of May with the help of a driver and meteorologist, who were providing instruments and holding a mirror to observe areas not directly visible, while Rogozov was in a semi-reclining position, half-turned to his left side. After 30-40 minutes Rogozov started to take short breaks because of general weakness and vertigo. Finally he removed the severely affected appendix. He applied antibiotics in the peritoneal cavity and closed the wound. The operation itself lasted an hour and 45 minutes. Partway through, the helping team took photographs of the operation.  \n  \n> *\u201cI worked without gloves. It was hard to see. The mirror helps, but it also hinders\u2014after all, it\u2019s showing things backwards. I work mainly by touch. The bleeding is quite heavy, but I take my time\u2014I try to work surely. Opening the peritoneum, I injured the blind gut and had to sew it up. Suddenly it flashed through my mind: there are more injuries here and I didn\u2019t notice them\u2026 I grow weaker and weaker, my head starts to spin. Every 4-5 minutes I rest for 20-25 seconds. Finally, here it is, the cursed appendage! With horror I notice the dark stain at its base. That means just a day longer and it would have burst and\u2026 At the worst moment of removing the appendix I flagged: my heart seized up and noticeably slowed; my hands felt like rubber. Well, I thought, it\u2019s going to end badly. And all that was left was removing the appendix\u2026 And then I realized that, basically, I was already saved\u201d.*  \n  \nAfter the operation gradual improvement occurred in the signs of peritonitis and in the general condition of Rogozov. Body temperature returned to normal after five days, and the stitches were removed seven days after the operation. He resumed his regular duties in about two weeks.The self-surgery captured the imagination of the Soviet public at the time. In 1961 he was awarded Order of the Red Banner of Labour.  \n  \nRogozov\u2019s self operation remains an example of determination and the human will for life. In later years Rogozov himself rejected all glorification of his deed. When thoughts like these were put to him, he usually answered with a smile and the words: *\u201cA job like any other, a life like any other\u201d.*  \n  \nIn October 1962 Rogozov returned to Leningrad and started working on an MD at his alma mater. In September 1966 he defended an MD thesis titled \u201cResection of the esophagus for treating esophageal cancer\u201d. He later worked as a doctor in various hospitals in Saint Petersburg. From 1986 to 2000 he served as the head of the surgery department of Saint Petersburg Research Institute for Tubercular Pulmonology.

She survived, as did the baby.\n\nThis was a poor uneducated village woman living in a hovel without running water or electricity. She was near term and one night she went into labor. Her husband was away, she was alone with her young kids, the oldest a boy of 8. Then she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen and the baby wouldn\u2019t come out. She knew it was alive because she could feel it move inside her, but she knew it\u2019d die unless something was done.\n\nThere was no hospital in the area, so she sent her 8 year old son to find the village \u201chealth assistant\u201d guy. But it was midnight and she knew it might be several hours before he arrived, and meanwhile her baby would die.\n\nSo she drank 3 small shots of liquor, got the kitchen knife, and sliced open her belly. It took her 3 attempts to cut through the skin and muscles and peritoneum, cutting from just below the ribs to just above the pubis. Then she cut open her uterus, reached in and pulled out the baby, cutting the umbilical cord with a pair of scissors. This whole process took an hour of cutting and pausing to rest, cutting again. Then she fainted from the loss of blood.\n\nWhen she regained consciousness, she bandaged the wound with old clothes to hold the edges together and stop the intestines from spilling out. Finally, the health assistant arrived, but he had no training or equipment to deal with this kind of stuff. He got a sewing needle and some thread, and sewed her up. Then he found a car; bundled both mother and baby in, and drove to the nearest hospital, eight hours away. But when they got there, they were made to wait another 16 hours before the doctors got around to them. They had to cut her open again to repair some intestines she\u2019d damaged while performing her own Caesarian.\n\nBut she survived, and so did her baby. The doctors said she lucked out because she chose a position where she was kneeling on the floor, leaning forward when she made the incision. This position put her uterus flush against her abdominal wall with the intestines pushed out of the way, so she didn\u2019t slice open her intestines while cutting.\n\nThere was a [story in USA Today](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-04-07-self-caesarean_x.htm) about it back at the time, and the doctors who finally saw her wrote up her case in the [International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology](http://www.ijgo.org/article/S0020-7292\\(03\\)00426-0/abstract).\n", "id": "d2aw4b6"}, {"comment": "That's something else.

After ordering personnel to transport these variously injured patients into the ship's operating room and prep them for surgery, Demara disappeared to his room with a textbook on general surgery and proceeded to speed-read the various surgeries he was now forced to perform, including major chest surgery. None of the casualties died as a result of Demara's surgeries. Apparently, the removal of a bullet from a wounded man ended up in Canadian newspapers.

The scope of the NFPA's influence grew from sprinklers and fire extinguishers to include building electrical systems (another new technology), and then into almost all aspects of building design and construction.\nIts original membership was limited to insurance underwriting firms and there was no representation from the industries the NFPA sought to control. This changed in 1904 to allow other industries and individuals to participate in the development of the standards to be promulgated by the NFPA. The first fire department to be represented in the NFPA was the New York City Fire Department in 1905, though their participation has declined steadily since then. Today, the NFPA includes representatives from some fire departments, many fire insurance companies, many manufacturing associations, some trade unions, many trade associations, and engineering associations.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fire_Protection_Association#History\n\nThis is the model where some building and safety codes come from, like literally, they write the codes.

The U.S. also continues to push boundaries of space exploration so even if you don't consider the moon as what won the space race, the continuation of the space program is very telling. \n\nI really can't wait until we (any country, although it is very likely to be the U.S.) put humans on Mars.

", "id": "d20tjga"}, {"comment": "I suppose the US won the space race goal that they had set out for themselves but I think what the original commenter was saying was that the space race didn't really have a fixed goal as such. \n\nThe USSR didn't send Sputnik into space with the idea that this is a small stepping stone on the path to getting a man on the moon. It was just another achievement designed to explore and show their capabilities. Both countries also wanted to land a person on another planet but that never really occurred, it was just the next big step in the goalless space race. If they did do so then reaching another solar system may have been the thing they never ended up doing. I guess what I'm saying is that I think the space race ended not because the goal was reached but because it was realised that it wasn't something you could really set a goal for and achieve. Like everything it is an ongoing endeavour that humanity will continue chipping away at probably forever and it never truly can be won. There's always something more to do.\n\nThe US definitely has continued it's space program to a higher degree thn the Russians and in that regard I suppose they are winning/have won the space race. Although the fact they rely on Soyuz rockets to get to space may suggest otherwise :/\n\nI'm really hoping for some more space exploration as well. I really don't know who it will be at this stage because the only people that seem actually committed to going to Mars are SpaceX. The US has expressed interest in going to Mars but it always seems very non-committal, as though they don't actually want to fund it but they know its what people want to hear. The CSA I think plans to go there but they are still technologically quite a way behind. I don't think the RSA has much interest in going to Mars. I think the only real other space race competitor is the ESA who I think recently announced plans to get there by 2035ish. Which is around the same time that the US made plans to go. It will be interesting to see how it plays out and whether they both end up going or fighting to be first. If I was to place a bet though I'm thinking the ESA will get there first. They have a much greater reason to try to prove themselves because NASA already has a long list of accomplishments. I think NASA/US gov would only be motivated by not wanting someone else to get there first rather than actually wanting to get there first themselves.\n\nI hope private companies continue to push into space exploration because I think it is a good motivator for other countries. That being said I don't think I would feel all too pleased if the first person on Mars were sent there by SpaceX. I feel it really takes away from the \"space exploration is a human endeavour\" aspect and it becomes not \"look what humanity\" did but \"look what amazing capabilities SpaceX\u00ae have!\". It would just feel like a huge ad and make such a great achievement feel somewhat tainted. It's probably the fact that while I appreciate private companies as motivators and making space more accessible, having them achieve firsts for humanity makes it seem as though getting there wasn't merit based or an altruistic goal but a marketing stunt to be able to sell space flights to the super rich. \n\nSorry about the super long winded post :/", "id": "d20urtx"}, {"comment": "To me what matters is not even who got there first, it's who was capable of continuing to go there on a regular basis with a low frequency of errors.", "id": "d20p0wl"}, {"comment": "There are several space programs around the world that do just that.

This comes from a book written by the journalist Igor Kostin. Kostin was NOT the first photographer on the scene, although he was one of the earliest journalists to have access to the disaster site. The first photographer was Volodimir Mikitovich Shevchenko. Shevchenko is most famous for his video of the [helicopter crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s40uKLCjcU) that took place early in the cleanup efforts. Shevchenko died less than a year after taking his photos of videos. He died from complications from acute radiation poisoning (ARS) and is listed as one of 49 or so individuals whose [death was a direct result of the accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_disaster#cite_note-33). While deaths from cancer due to the accident are hard to track, deaths from ARS directly caused by the disaster are actually low.\n\n2. There is no baby in that stroller. There are dozens of accounts of the cleanup of the Chernobyl disaster, and not one can corroborate Kostin's claim that there were people left behind. What Kostin *did* get correct, and what *is* corroborated by every single source (excluding government coverup sources) is that the Soviet government took *a WEEK* to evacuate the nearby town of Pripyat. During that week, untold numbers of people were exposed to dangerous amounts of ionizing radiation, and while no one in the town died of ARS, many died years and even decades later from cancer. In fact, **I don't think Kostin even made this claim**. He's generally a good journalist. (It's been over a decade since I read this book and I don't own a copy, although feel free to buy me one). I think people just see this photo and assume a baby was left behind, when the reality is that liquidators did not have the appropriate equipment or even enough equipment to do their jobs. I'll bet that the baby carriage was just one of the things liquidators grabbed so that they could do their jobs.\n\n3. Just because it came up in some comments below - Chernobyl, like many commercial reactors at the time, used water as a *coolant*, not graphite. Graphite is often used in reactors as a *neutron moderator*, which is very different than a coolant. In the case of Chernobyl's reactors and all other RBMK-1 reactors, graphite was used at the tip of the control rods that modulated (controlled) the functioning of the reactor. These graphite tipped control rods contributed directly to the disaster - the accident occurred when the control rods were all fully lifted out of the reactor core. When the reactor ran out of control and the reactor operators dropped the control rods back into place to slow down the reactor (they were dropped using only gravity, another design flaw), the graphite tips caught fire and melted from the intense heat, making it impossible for the control rods to be inserted any further, and thereby allowing the reactor to go critical and melt down.\n\n4. Currently, commercial reactors all use water for coolant. In the 60's, GE was experimenting with thorium fueled, liquid sodium cooled research reactors, but liquid sodium is harder to manage than water, so they eventually abandoned the method in favor of PWR and BWR reactors, both of which use water for coolant. Interest in thorium fueled reactors has begun again, because they are much better reactors even though the coolant is harder to work with.\n\n5. Chernobyl's 4 reactors were all RBMK-1 class reactors, and RBMKs are riddled with serious design flaws. Since the disaster, all RBMK reactors in the former Soviet Union have been decommissioned or are in the process of being decommissioned, and the construction of all new RBMK reactors has been halted.\n\n6. The liquidator in that photo is dead, I can almost guarantee it. The Soviet government basically treated the liquidators as a human sacrifice. They were expendable - you could always get more - and in the ensuing years, they have almost universally suffered from radiation-caused illnesses and cancers. Many have died from their health conditions.\n"], [58, "I'd love to know more about this, if anyone has any information."], [33, "This is the type of picture an emo-punk band would put on their album cover"], [27, "Until someone shows me another photo or angle that there is a human in that cart, there is no fucking baby in there.

This comes from a book written by the journalist Igor Kostin. Kostin was NOT the first photographer on the scene, although he was one of the earliest journalists to have access to the disaster site. The first photographer was Volodimir Mikitovich Shevchenko. Shevchenko is most famous for his video of the [helicopter crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s40uKLCjcU) that took place early in the cleanup efforts. Shevchenko died less than a year after taking his photos of videos. He died from complications from acute radiation poisoning (ARS) and is listed as one of 49 or so individuals whose [death was a direct result of the accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_disaster#cite_note-33). While deaths from cancer due to the accident are hard to track, deaths from ARS directly caused by the disaster are actually low.\n\n2. There is no baby in that stroller. There are dozens of accounts of the cleanup of the Chernobyl disaster, and not one can corroborate Kostin's claim that there were people left behind. What Kostin *did* get correct, and what *is* corroborated by every single source (excluding government coverup sources) is that the Soviet government took *a WEEK* to evacuate the nearby town of Pripyat. During that week, untold numbers of people were exposed to dangerous amounts of ionizing radiation, and while no one in the town died of ARS, many died years and even decades later from cancer. In fact, **I don't think Kostin even made this claim**. He's generally a good journalist. (It's been over a decade since I read this book and I don't own a copy, although feel free to buy me one). I think people just see this photo and assume a baby was left behind, when the reality is that liquidators did not have the appropriate equipment or even enough equipment to do their jobs. I'll bet that the baby carriage was just one of the things liquidators grabbed so that they could do their jobs.\n\n3. Just because it came up in some comments below - Chernobyl, like many commercial reactors at the time, used water as a *coolant*, not graphite. Graphite is often used in reactors as a *neutron moderator*, which is very different than a coolant. In the case of Chernobyl's reactors and all other RBMK-1 reactors, graphite was used at the tip of the control rods that modulated (controlled) the functioning of the reactor. These graphite tipped control rods contributed directly to the disaster - the accident occurred when the control rods were all fully lifted out of the reactor core. When the reactor ran out of control and the reactor operators dropped the control rods back into place to slow down the reactor (they were dropped using only gravity, another design flaw), the graphite tips caught fire and melted from the intense heat, making it impossible for the control rods to be inserted any further, and thereby allowing the reactor to go critical and melt down.\n\n4. Currently, commercial reactors all use water for coolant. In the 60's, GE was experimenting with thorium fueled, liquid sodium cooled research reactors, but liquid sodium is harder to manage than water, so they eventually abandoned the method in favor of PWR and BWR reactors, both of which use water for coolant. Interest in thorium fueled reactors has begun again, because they are much better reactors even though the coolant is harder to work with.\n\n5. Chernobyl's 4 reactors were all RBMK-1 class reactors, and RBMKs are riddled with serious design flaws. Since the disaster, all RBMK reactors in the former Soviet Union have been decommissioned or are in the process of being decommissioned, and the construction of all new RBMK reactors has been halted.\n\n6. The liquidator in that photo is dead, I can almost guarantee it. The Soviet government basically treated the liquidators as a human sacrifice. They were expendable - you could always get more - and in the ensuing years, they have almost universally suffered from radiation-caused illnesses and cancers. Many have died from their health conditions.\n", "id": "d0vxw1h"}, {"comment": ">  In the case of Chernobyl's reactors and all other RBMK-1 reactors, graphite was used at the tip of the control rods that modulated (controlled) the functioning of the reactor.\n\nI believe it was also used as the main moderator inside the reactor core as well, not just control rod tips, as can be seen here in this photo from Chernobyl:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e4/Ejected_graphite_from_Chernobyl_core.jpg", "id": "d0w3366"}, {"comment": "[Stroller being used for work](https://youtu.be/dS3WvKKSpKI?t=49m9s)", "id": "d0wa1qu"}], [{"comment": "I'd love to know more about this, if anyone has any information.", "id": "d0vp42r"}, {"comment": "This was all I could find, and it's just one sentence in the middle that states a live infant was found, then further down captions this photo by again stating the infant was alive.

One could also argue that hip firing dampens felt recoil, and can allow for faster firing since the point of recoil is closer to the user's center of gravity. It also increases the speed at which you can point a weapon, since when shouldered the butt of the gun is the axis of rotation, as opposed to hip firing where the axis is closer to the torso.\n\nYou could get all of these benefits at only a slight loss of accuracy at close range. And at below 20 feet or so (with buckshot or smaller) *no* appreciable  loss in accuracy. With enough practice, a person could probably hip fire a shotgun almost all the way out to its effective maximum range.\n\nSource: I like dove hunting, and always fire from the shoulder because I don't actually worry about any of that.

What more could a boy want?? So I begged and Dad said OK and we picked out what looked like a good one and they wrapped it up and even threw in a tin of corrosive surplus ammo for me. We got home and I cleaned it and cleaned it till Daddy took me out back to shoot. I had it in my holster and thought I was just the coolest guy ever. I lined up on the target and pop she fired and went pretty close to where I aimed. The slide ran flawless but with no extractor I ended up using the cleaning rod to eject my cases!

One cannot argue that third world countries are better for women than the west. So the debate must center around whether women's rights caused the west's ascension or economic advancement laid the groundwork for equality. \nThis question demands imperical data because one could come up with theoretical explanations for either case. \nSo what is the reason for the wests equality versus the third world's mistreatment of women? \nIn Friedman's *The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth*, Friedman gives several examples of economic growth proceeding liberal policies, as well as the inverse. \n\nA few examples would be the second reform act of 1867 (Britain) Women's Suffrage also in Britain, Beverage reforms. \n\nIn America we see the Civial Rights reforms coinciding with growth.

Lets contrast Guantanamo Bay to Buchenwald, for example:\n\n---\n\nGuantanamo Bay \n\n* Not only is it not on US soil, but it's on an island nation that US citizens are legally prohibited from traveling to, making the number of civilians that would be aware it exists before it was publicized rather small. Prisoners, who were most often foreign citizens, are transported in secret and often individually on military transports.\n\nBuchenwald  \n\n* Buchenwald was one of dozens of concentration camps, and there were satellite camps numbering in the thousands for logistics, transport, etc of people sent there. The scent of the bodies being burned in the ones with crematoriums would sometimes travel for miles around them. The prisoners, who were often from the very same region the camp was in, were loaded in broad daylight into civilian cattle cars en masse with no supplies or amenities, some wouldn't even survive the trip. \n\n---\n\nGuantanamo  Bay \n\n* A full fledged Naval Base that controls 45 miles of area around it, so it's not like you can walk up to a fence and see the prisoners. And the actual part where the torture took place is in a detention facility WITHIN the naval base. When was the last time you wandered onto a military base your country ran?\n\nBuchenwald  \n\n* An 8km trip from the center of Wiemar. That's less than a 30 minute bike ride. \n\n---\n\nGuantanamo  Bay  \n\n* 779 prisoners have been held at Guantanamo Bay, 9 of which died. That's a death toll of around 1% over about 13 years. \n\nBuchenwald  \n\n* **A quarter of a million people** (240,000 to be specific) passed through Buchenwald. That's more people every 2 weeks, on average, than Guantanamo Bay saw in its entire existence. Over 56,000 people died there during that time as well. That's an **annual death toll** of more than 7x the total number of Gitmo inmates, living and dead, ever. Never mind the fact that Gitmo has had less than a dozen inmates killed. Than means that of the Buchenwald inmates, something like 23% died over 8 years, which is just shy of half as long as Guantanamo Bay's entire operating time. \n\nAnd that's a single camp. The crazy thing is, Buchenwald wasn't even considered one of the \"extermination camps.\" Those were mostly built in Poland, and Auschwitz alone killed over a million people in just 5 years. \n\nI think that what the US did at Guantanamo Bay is inexcusable, and a travesty to everything the country claims to stand for. Everyone involved should be brought up on war crimes as far as I'm concerned. \n\nBut let me be clear, comparing Guantanamo Bay to a concentration camp does two things: first, it exaggerates what went on there significantly, and second, it diminishes what happened at the actual concentration camps, which was so many orders of magnitude higher in horror and scale that it's literally incomparable in my opinion.

Its infrastructure was devastated, the government and civil service eviscerated, the male population reduced enormously, and obviously its citizens underwent enormous suffering during and after the conflict. The Nazi apparatus wasn't just the politicians calling the shots in Berlin: it was also the lawyers, the doctors, the teachers, the postmen. So when it came to rebuilding the country, you needed to rebuild the vital institutions more or less from the ground up. ~40% of the male German population served in the Wehrmacht during WWII; if they were treated uniformly as participants in the enormous crimes the Wehrmacht committed, how could the country ever thrive again? And that's just on the basic, functioning level. With the breakdown of Soviet/Western relations, the threat of a war with the Communist bloc, with Germany again as the frontlines, loomed large. How could West Germany have a functioning military without employing much of the personnel and officers who had served during WWII? How could the notion of a re-armed Germany be sold to the public, both domestically and abroad? The \"clean Wehrmacht\" myth was a simple political solution.\n\nThe personal element is more complicated. There's a lot of history here to unpack. The central word is *vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung*: it  means \"coming to terms with the past.\" In the immediate post-war, Germany was shell-shocked. The population had been immersed in Nazi propaganda and ideology, and to many there was a sense of surreality to the utter defeat they had experienced. A notion of German victimhood appeared: that yes, maybe Germany had started the war, and yes, maybe, a few Nazis had committed some terrible crimes, but that that didn't merit the enormous retribution served to them. It was a popular opinion that Germany, via strategic bombing and the Allied invasion, had suffered just as much. if not more, than the Jews or any other country they had invaded. It was a form of denial in many ways, and it persisted through the 1950s and 1960s. It's a massively complicated subject, and not alone to Germany: Austria has had to deal with similar themes, and many Eastern European countries have not yet had their reckoning with regards to their participation in the Holocaust.\n\nIf you want to read about things on a more emotional level, you can read the interesting work *Grandpa wasn't a Nazi* [here](http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=7oJILSPwFfJSG&b=8449863&ct=12485707).

The majority of Americans/Europeans at the time were Christian and no matter what your denomination, one thing they all agreed on was that Jesus was a pretty swell guy, and many people blamed the Jews for killing him. Which is why Jews have often been referred to as \"Christ-Killers\"\n\n2. For social and religious reasons many jobs were not open to Jews, some of the few the Jews could consistently be employed in was the financial sector as bankers, accountants etc. This is why conspiracies exist about Jews controlling the world economy and all the money, and also why Jews are stereotyped as being greedy. Additionally many people find it hard to like people richer than them, especially if they owe them money.\n\n3. Many Jews did not integrate into their country's culture. They often kept to their own communities and spoke their own language (Yiddish/Hebrew usually). That coupled with the fact that they were Jewish and not Christian made them seem different to \"normal\" Germans or English or Americans. Which just further created tension.\n\n4. Tradition. You ever notice how most Christians tend to have Christian parents, or how most racists tend to have racist parents? People are always influenced by the people they grow up around and it's no different with anti-semitism. If your parents told you that Jews were bad when you were a child then naturally you'd believe them, and why wouldn't you? They'd been persecuted for 1000s of years so it only seems natural to think that they must be bad.\n\n5. Racism. You've got to remember that pre-WW2, eugenics was rather popular amongst western society. Many people considered Jews to be a completely separate race rather than just a religion and that they were either inferior or just less-desirable that \"normal\" people. It's one of the reasons Jews are stereotyped as having big, hooked noses.

Unlike Sunni Islam, the kind of Shia brand in Iran depend a lot on the clergy. They were not like Vatican but they were extremely important. They are kind of designed that way because of the history of shia and Iran. In Sunni islam, clergy is designed to be an organ to the state and they usually have to obey the political class at the end of the day. They occasionally prevail against political elite, they shape them, but they have to abide and comply most of the time. When an Ottoman ruler asked for a decree on something he wanted to do, he got it. Even if it was about killing his own baby brothers or his sons (Suleiman got his two sons killed and clergy said it was OK). \n\nIran used to be a mixture of Shia and Sunni islam, Shia being always the rebels against sunni authorities. This changed in 16th century when the country was transformed to Shia by Safevids and they needed a strong clergy that sided with the state afterwards. They even had their own stronghold of a city that was separate from the capital of the country.  \n\nCome to 20th century, all that was needed for them injection of political islamic ideology and some organization to clergy.

"], [204, "AP photojournalist Horst Faas took this iconic photo on June 18, 1965, during the Vietnam War with the 173rd Airborne Brigade Battalion on defense duty at Phouc Vinh airstrip in South Vietnam. The headband message \u201cWar is Hell\u201d typified an acerbic attitude of many young American soldiers who were likely drafted and sent to the remote southeastern Asia jungles to engage in deadly and terrifying combat. A lot of the soldiers wrote graffiti on their helmets with inscriptions of their attitudes about where they were and why they were there.  \n  \nThe contrast is what makes this photo iconic. You have this, bright, young handsome soldier with a smile on his face and then you have the text on his helmet. Take the helmet out, and this could easily be a high school yearbook photo. His face betrays a sense of innocence, but when you look at his helmet, you can tell that he is anything but. You know that he has witnessed the horrors of war firsthand and is trying to cover it all up on the outside.  \n  \nThe identity of the soldier was unknown for many decades until recently when he was identified as Larry Wayne Chaffin from St. Louis. He served with that brigade in Vietnam for exactly one year beginning in May 1965 and when the photo was taken he was 19. Chaffin had many problems adjusting to civilian life when he returned from Vietnam. He died at the age of 39 from complications that arose from diabetes, an ailment he might have contracted from exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam. He died in 1985.  \n  \nThe \u201cWar is Hell\u201d quote originates from William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019 address to the graduating class of the Michigan Military Academy (19 June 1879); but slightly varying accounts of this speech have been published. Sherman was a Union Army general during the American Civil War. He succeeded General U.S. Grant as commander of the Western Theater of that war in the spring of 1864. The full quote:  \n  \n> \u201cI\u2019ve been where you are now and I know just how you feel. It\u2019s entirely natural that there should beat in the breast of every one of you a hope and desire that some day you can use the skill you have acquired here. Suppress it! You don\u2019t know the horrible aspects of war. I\u2019ve been through two wars and I know. I\u2019ve seen cities and homes in ashes. I\u2019ve seen thousands of men lying on the ground, their dead faces looking up at the skies.

The headband message \u201cWar is Hell\u201d typified an acerbic attitude of many young American soldiers who were likely drafted and sent to the remote southeastern Asia jungles to engage in deadly and terrifying combat. A lot of the soldiers wrote graffiti on their helmets with inscriptions of their attitudes about where they were and why they were there.  \n  \nThe contrast is what makes this photo iconic. You have this, bright, young handsome soldier with a smile on his face and then you have the text on his helmet. Take the helmet out, and this could easily be a high school yearbook photo. His face betrays a sense of innocence, but when you look at his helmet, you can tell that he is anything but. You know that he has witnessed the horrors of war firsthand and is trying to cover it all up on the outside.  \n  \nThe identity of the soldier was unknown for many decades until recently when he was identified as Larry Wayne Chaffin from St. Louis. He served with that brigade in Vietnam for exactly one year beginning in May 1965 and when the photo was taken he was 19. Chaffin had many problems adjusting to civilian life when he returned from Vietnam. He died at the age of 39 from complications that arose from diabetes, an ailment he might have contracted from exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam. He died in 1985.  \n  \nThe \u201cWar is Hell\u201d quote originates from William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019 address to the graduating class of the Michigan Military Academy (19 June 1879); but slightly varying accounts of this speech have been published. Sherman was a Union Army general during the American Civil War. He succeeded General U.S. Grant as commander of the Western Theater of that war in the spring of 1864. The full quote:  \n  \n> \u201cI\u2019ve been where you are now and I know just how you feel. It\u2019s entirely natural that there should beat in the breast of every one of you a hope and desire that some day you can use the skill you have acquired here. Suppress it! You don\u2019t know the horrible aspects of war. I\u2019ve been through two wars and I know. I\u2019ve seen cities and homes in ashes. I\u2019ve seen thousands of men lying on the ground, their dead faces looking up at the skies. I tell you, War is Hell!\u201c.  \n  \n[**COLORIZED VERSION**](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nl2RSjQjj3o/VCOKT4omlUI/AAAAAAAAJz8/LGIfBjkDYQM/s1600/An%2BAmerican%2Bsoldier%2Bwears%2Ba%2Bhand%2Blettered%2BWar%2BIs%2BHell%2Bslogan%2Bon%2Bhis%2Bhelmet%2C%2BVietnam%2C%2B1965%2B3.jpg)\n  \n[*Source*](http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/soldier-war-is-hell-vietnam-1965/)", "id": "d3p0vcs"}, {"comment": "Fuck, I just knew there wasn't going to be a good ending about this poor fellow.

Get over yourself.\n", "id": "d0q3nc2"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d0q3ujn"}, {"comment": "**So, was Che a murderer?**\n\nI would say that the answer here depends upon your conception of the charge of murder. Is killing a soldier in battle or an agent of the government you are at war with considered murder? Is the death penalty murder? Is shooting deserters, traitors, murderers, or rapists within your own ranks murder? If you answer yes to any of these, you may call Guevara a murderer. If you answer no, I would argue that there is no evidence to accuse Guevara of murder.\n\nIn Cuba, and in the Congo, and in Bolivia, Guevara was certainly both directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of soldiers, police, and other agents of the governments against which he fought. Guevara, as a Marxist-Leninist, certainly believed in the necessity of violent struggle. \n\nIt is important, I think, to understand *why* Guevara held this belief. Prior to meeting with Cuban exiles in Mexico and joining the invasion of Batista's Cuba on the Granma with the Castros and other revolutionaries, Che Guevara had spent time living in Guatemala. In 1950, President Jacobo \u00c1rbenz was popularly elected on the promise of a land reform program, meant to remedy some of the ills of colonial and foreign domination of Guatemalan land and resources. Setting about this land reform, \u00c1rbenz's government began to seize unworked land owned by large landowners, compensating them at the values they had stated for their property on their taxes. This threatened the profits of the United Fruit Company (now Chiquita), who owned wide swaths of fallow land, the value of which it had been understating for decades to avoid taxation. The head of the CIA and Secretary of State in the U.S. both happened to be on the board of United Fruit (in addition to being brothers), and orchestrated a U.S.-backed campaign of terror and violence to overthrow the democratically elected government and replace it with a military dictatorship. Successive regimes maximized profits for multinational corporations while, in collaboration with the United States, violently suppressed dissent, as in the Mayan Genocide in the 1980s.\n\nGuevara was in Guatemala City for the coup, and initially sought to resist it. However, he found workers' groups under-armed and under-prepared. Publicly known to be a leftist who had resisted the coup, Guevara fled the country. Just as the coup shaped his disillusionment with liberal democracies, the state of the working class convinced him that for progress to be secure, the workers and other lower classes must be armed. Guevara had not emerged from Argentina one day convinced that violence was the only way. He had seen a popular leader make some headway, and then seen him brutally overthrown and a repressive regime installed by the owning class. This disillusionment would be mirrored in much of Latin America two decades later, after the 1973 coup against the Chilean government of Salvador Allende.\n\nHowever, I think that killing your enemies in war is generally understood by most people to be different from killing innocents in cold blood. It is this latter accusation that is implied when one calls Guevara a murderer. \n\nFollowing the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Guevara was assigned for a time to oversee the prison at La Caba\u00f1a. His duties involved overseeing the executions of those convicted of war crimes at the prison. Because of this duty, Guevara is sometimes called the \"Butcher of La Caba\u00f1a\" in the Cuban ex-pat community. The revolutionary government claimed to be basing its trials for war crimes upon the international precedent set by the Nuremberg Trials. The process consisted of two tribunals, one of which tried civilians and one of which tried members of Batista's military. Only the latter could order an execution for those convicted of war crimes. Guevara's role, like that of governors in the United States, consisted of reviewing the verdicts, offering pardons, and setting execution dates. Guevara remained assigned to this role for several months, during which he oversaw between 55 and 105 executions.\n\nOn the popularity of the execution of war criminals, and on the role of Guevara in the process, historian Paco Ignacio Taibo II writes in *Guevara, Also Known as Che*,\n\n&gt;*Fidel launched a counterattack to the U.S. campaign in a speech he gave January 21 at the National Palace, comparing the crimes committed during the dictatorship with those judged at Nuremberg and asserting the people's right to see justice done and to carry out the executions. He asked for a show of hands: was justice meted out to the torturers? According to Carlos Franqui, who was editor of* Revoluci\u00f3n *at the time: \"Fidel's question was answered by an overwhelming 'Yes!'* **A private nationwide survey showed 93 percent in favor of the trials and shootings.***\" Che was present at the gathering, but took no part in the demonstration.*\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;*Without a doubt Che was in favor of the summary trials, but the tales woven by Cuban exiles, in which he was the \"Butcher of La Caba\u00f1a,\" presiding over most of the shootings in Havana, are flights of fantasy. Revolutionary Tribunals No. 1 and No. 2 did sit at La Caba\u00f1a, the first trying policemen and soldiers, the second (which did not pass death sentences) trying civilians. RT1, presided over by Miguel \u00c1ngel Duque de Estrada, did pass the death sentence in some cases, at least two dozen of which were in January. Che did not sit on either tribunal, but did review appeals in his capacity as commander. He could have had no doubts as he ratified the sentences; he believed in the justice of what he was doing and over the previous years had become very tough-minded about such situations.*\n\nOn the quality of polls in Cuba at the time, Carmelo Mesa-Lago argues in \"Availability and Reliability of Statistics in Socialist Cuba (Part One\") that before the Bay of Pigs (1961), they were generally free and objective. The above poll would have taken place in 1959.\n\nWhether or not you believe Guevara was a murderer should depend upon your judgement of war and the practice of executing war criminals, rather than upon unfounded accusations that Guevara massacred innocents.\n\n**Che Guevara in mind and history**\n\n\"Why Che?\" This is a question many have asked, seeing images of the fallen revolutionary emblazoned upon murals, movie posters, and t-shirts. Guevara was young, ruggedly handsome, and a seasoned revolutionary leader when his image first exploded upon the global scene, and that enough secured him lasting fame. But it's something much more than that, which elevates *el Che* to an unmatched stature, inspiring intense love and intense hate.\n\nIn [this New York Times review](http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/26/reviews/971026.26uhligt.html) of two biographies on Guevara, the writer hits the nail on the head:\n\n&gt;Three decades after he was captured and killed by the Bolivian Army on still another revolutionary mission, Guevara remains an icon of leftist idealism and subversive mystique, inspiring a mini-boom of recent biographies, film projects and post-cold-war nostalgia. From the tin-roofed barrios of Lima to the coffeehouses of Prague, **he represents that most romantic of political contradictions -- a rebel who won yet continued to rebel.**\n\nI have written responses to questions on [Guevara's military prowess](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hx191/was_che_guevara_a_successful_and_proficient/cayspbj) and [his successes and failures in his brief tenure in the revolutionary government of Cuba](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hx191/was_che_guevara_a_successful_and_proficient/cayxppa?context=1). A physician and a lover of learning, Guevara is perhaps the most responsible individual for unparalleled Cuban programs in medicine and literacy, as well as the driving force behind sweeping land reform (which sparked U.S. bombings and and an invasion, in an impotent echo of the 1954 Guatemalan coup). Had Guevara remained in Cuba, he could have been one of the leaders of its government, and might even be alive with Fidel Castro today. However, after assuring himself that Cuba was on the revolutionary track ([I have also written on the course and goals of the Cuban Revolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1e84gu/why_did_cuba_go_with_the_soviet_union_when_they/c9xr5hv)), he went on to fight until death around the world.\n\nChe Guevara is seen as a romantic symbol by many, and is hated by many. It is important, in the conflict that this creates, to remember that he was a man, and that he was, at the core of his being and until the very end, a violent communist revolutionary. All of his actions, from Cuba onwards, should be viewed in this light. He sought to use force of arms to overthrow the capitalist owning class, which he saw as brutally oppressing the peoples of the world, and replace it with Marxist-Leninist states that would build socialism and one day transition to communism. He did not seek to kill innocents or those he saw as oppressed, but he had no problem violently overthrowing oppressors and killing their soldiers, and believed that he was acting for the ultimate good of mankind. If he were to hear criticisms today, he might echo Fidel Castro, in saying, \"History will absolve me.\" \n\nIn reinforcing the idea that Guevara was a man embroiled in violent struggle, one might be tempted to say \"Remember, he was no saint\".

The only way your count for Che's executions could be correct is if literally 2 fifths of the deaths during a war were executions by Che and Castro. *Free Society Project / Cuba Archive* puts the number of executions ordered or committed by Che at 144, plus 105 at La Ca Caba\u00f1a.  The amount of people killed, or ordered killed by Che was certainly not more than 500, and almost certainly less than half of that, and most of those killed were those who collaborated with the Batista government who by every single unbiased, academic, historic account killed far more than Che or Castro.  The vast majority of Cubans (about 93%) supported Che's tribunals because the majority of people he killed were ranking officials in Batista's army or government regime, one of the most oppressive regimes to exist since WWII.\n\nTo call Castro's regime fascist also shows a huge degree of ignorance in regards to politics and the history of Cuba.

Likewise, writing lyrics that people remember and sing even if they hear it once is not easy.\n\nIs Lady Gaga David Bowie? Of course not.

It's a tool that is used as efficiently and effectively as an author's writing style, pacing, execution, character development, dialogue, and almost every other aspect of writing considered under literary criticism.\n\nHowever, literary criticism is based on the merits and faults of a piece of literature. It's not solely an opinion and it certainly shouldn't be considered as such. The act of criticizing any work of art requires references, correlations, and theories backed by strong evidence and a detailed development of thoughts/events.

I cannot stress this to you enough. It's the most complete and comprehensive waste of your time that could possibly, conceivably exist. It's incredibly boring, it's incredibly poorly made, it's meandering, it's lost, it lacks any sort (literally any sort) of coherence. They don't even stop recording when you can clearly hear their dogs barking in their recording space. There are no onscreen interviews with anyone. The people spouting the literally insane (blurry poster of mountain skiier looks like a Minotaur! / When Ullman stands next to his desk, the desktop drawers make it look like he's got an erection!) theories have absolutely no credentials. The pauses in their meandering, unfocused stories aren't even edited out and sometimes last an uncomfortably long time. The evidence for their claims is rarely presented and when it does crop up, is clearly bullshit. Kubrick did *not* airbrush his face into the clouds during the helicopter scenes during the opening credits... didn't happen. The bathroom and the bar do *not* occupy the same space based on a map of the hotel you drew *which she admits isn't even to scale anyway.*\n\nI have no idea how this mindset that the film is great keeps its momentum. It's not great. It's not even shit, its so low on the scale nobody bothered to write a degrading level name that far down in the pit that it resides in. Whatever the people who thought that documentary was good were smoking... couldn't possibly be medically recommended to take.\n\nI hope that nobody thinks I'm kidding. I'm not even exaggerating. The film is frustrating to watch because of how awful it is. Please understand me, I am not kidding or joking around when I say that.

Also, I have an uncle in Vermont who's a stoner, so my family just ticks off all the boxes.) \n \nSpeaking of Louisiana and Mississippi, one interesting fact about the election of 1964 (which White couldn't have known writing in 1965) is that it was essentially the end of Democratic domination of the Deep South and the end of the New Deal coalition. Everybody says Goldwater was crazy, but pretty much the gist of my paper was that in fact no, it's thanks to him that much of politics is the way it is. One part of that is that from right before the end of Radical Reconstruction straight through until 1960, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi *always* went Democrat or Dixiecrat, and Louisiana only went Republican twice (1876, the year that began the trend, and 1956, just before the end of it).\n\nIt was because of Kennedy's and Johnson's handling of civil rights and how Goldwater responded to it and pushed the Republican party to the right that those five states have gone Republican ever since. The only times they have voted Democratic were when Jimmy Carter, a Georgian, was elected in 1976 and all five voted for him (when he lost in 1980, Georgia still went his way) and when Bill Clinton, an Arkansan, won Louisiana and Georgia in 1992, and Louisiana again in 1996. In terms of influence on the current electoral map, Goldwater's name should be included up there with Lincoln and Grant, but he never gets mentioned.

He even claimed he was having his last press conference in '62.

I didn't have the time, and I mostly used the areas around pp.90-110 and pp.190-210 in my paper.\n\nIf you want to get an idea of Goldwater's ideology and see where he fits in today (in my opinion, he's actually quite moderate compared to some modern politicians), try some of his own writings, like *The Conscience of a Conservative*, (Washington, D.C.: Regnery, 1960), which was his first book; *With No Apologies*, (New York: Morrow, 1979), his memoirs; or his acceptance speech for the nomination at the Republican Convention, \u201cExtremism in the Defense of Liberty.\u201d Phyllis Schlafly wrote a thing about why she was voting for him (*A Choice, Not an Echo* (Pere Marquette Press, 1964)), which is pretty interesting, and Lee Edwards, his aide, has a good, if biased biography of him.

The Republican primaries were really weird.**\n\nBarry Goldwater, a far-right (for the time) conservative, was the Republican favorite going into them, and Nelson Rockefeller, a liberal Republican (which wasn't actually all that uncommon then), was the next likely candidate. They both get destroyed in New Hampshire by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., who didn't even have a real campaign and was half the way across the world *in Saigon* at the time because he was U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam. Lodge didn't even announce a candidacy, so he *wasn't on the ballot*, and he still won the state. Somehow.\n\nRockefeller won Oregon, which was kinda big, and Goldwater won California, which was very big and also going to be the site of the Republican Convention. Then, in the convention, Goldwater, despite the fact that he lost New Hampshire (which often, by dint of N.H. voting first, sets a trend), came back and won with 883 votes out of 1308. Second in the convention was Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, who was a literal nobody in New Hampshire. Lodge got only 2 votes in the convention. Hiram Fong, who never really had a chance at all, did better than Lodge in the convention. It was unpredictable. Also, the convention was held in a convention center called the Cow Palace. Seriously. You can't make this stuff up.\n\n**2. Goldwater himself.**\n\nGoldwater was really unexpectedly far-right for the 1960s (Trump and Cruz make him look like a moderate, though). Since the 1930s and the introduction of the New Deal, conservatism hadn't really existed or had any traction in any significant numbers. Sure, there had been a few voices speaking out against the growth of government power, which had mostly been to keep the country alive during the Depression and the Second World War. However, not much actually happened to roll any of the changes back, mainly because of how Democrats appealed to so much of the country.\n\nThe Democrats had been becoming more pro-civil-rights over time, getting blacks to slowly come over to their side because of the New Deal's relatively equal opportunity. Originally, in 1860, Democrats were hardline pro-slavery and Republicans were pro-emancipation, so blacks from then until the '30s mostly went Republican if they weren't intimidated by their white neighbors into voting Democratic. However, the liberal working-man's-advocate section of the Democratic party eventually came to influence their message the most, so Democrats introduced parts of the New Deal in the '30s that helped poor whites and blacks equally.\n\nBy doing this, Democrats began to swing blacks to their side while still maintaining the vote of the Southern and Northern working-class white man. However, by 1964 the Southern Democrats (that is, the anti-civil-rights lot) had begun to realize what was happening and, since Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Southern Democrats almost overwhelmingly switched parties to support him. Goldwater destroyed the coalition of voters that the New Deal created; for the first time in a few decades it was uncertain who would vote for whom, since Goldwater seemed to have managed to swing white working-class voters to his side due to their anger over Democratic progress on civil rights. His presence threw the whole thing off.\n\nSide note: Goldwater probably didn't vote against the Civil Rights Act due to racism; he claimed to be voting that way out of respect for limited constitutional government, and later in life he supported gay rights. Goldwater was very unhappy with parts of modern conservatism, especially the Religious Right; he was more of a libertarian/anticommunist conservative than what we now associate with conservatism (the homophobia and the feeling that Christianity is under attack, that is). When Jerry Falwell, leader of the Moral Majority, said that every good Christian ought to be scared that women were being considered for nomination to the Supreme Court, Goldwater responded that \"every good Christian ought to kick Jerry Falwell in the ass\". That's true. You can't make this stuff up.\n\n**3. The things Goldwater said.**\n\nGoldwater was very conservative in terms of how much he really didn't like communism. He strongly believed that LBJ's indecision in Vietnam was costing American lives for nothing, and that America had to go on a big offensive and end the war quickly. He was so vocal about this all that he brought up the use of low-yield nuclear weapons as defoliants in Vietnam during a televised interview. My sources are unclear on this; he either meant to say that he had been present at a high-level executive-branch meeting where it had been proposed, or maybe he said it and meant it seriously, but it didn't matter which he said, since the press used the second story. Even if the first one was the true one, he probably wouldn't have brought it up if it hadn't had some effect on his plans for Vietnam, and as mentioned it wasn't that far out of line with core parts of his foreign policy.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Goldwater was very moderate compared to today's politicians, but in this aspect he blows conservatives out of the water. Going after the noncombatant family members of ISIS? How about literally *using nuclear weapons* on civilians and soldiers alike? It's my personal appraisal of Goldwater and his phrasing, considering what I've read on the topic, that he didn't really intend to use nukes, and I'm not a conservative, so I don't see my perception as motivated by ideology. It seems most likely to me that he was just mentioning that the possibility had been brought up, but either way that's not what the public saw. \n\n**4. LBJ played really dirty.**\n\nI respect Johnson for a lot of things, and I respect Goldwater for a lot of things, but just as I think Goldwater was too much of a warmonger even if he didn't mean to condone using nuclear weapons, I also think LBJ was just *evil* when it came to campaigning. Goldwater and Kennedy had been friends despite their differences, but LBJ was not an amiable guy. (Johnson was quite tall and bulky, and often would lean over somebody he was trying to convince, put his face millimeters away from their face, and almost bully them into agreeing.) Johnson saw Goldwater's comments about nuclear weapons as a golden opportunity, and he ran with it as far as he could go.\n\nPerhaps the most famous political ad of all time was aired by Johnson's campaign. In it, a little girl is in a field, picking off the petals of a daisy and counting up to ten, missing one number and saying another twice. Aww, so cute. Then a countdown from ten starts, and the camera zooms in on the girl's eye. Then, boom. A nuclear mushroom cloud. \"Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.\" Neither Goldwater\u2019s name nor his policies were mentioned, but Johnson\u2019s message was clear. \"Goldwater is going to kill us all,\" he implied, \"our cute little kids included, and I'm going to save you from him.\"\n\n**5. The results.**\n\nNever has a candidate lost the popular vote so badly as Barry Goldwater did in November 1964. He got about 39% of the popular vote to Johnson's 61%, with a turnout of about 60%. He won only the states of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, (all due to white fear over civil rights, which, as mentioned, Goldwater voted against,) and his home state of Arizona, where he had already won senatorial elections two terms in a row. (People have lost worse in the electoral college, though, such as George McGovern, the Democrat in 1972, who lost all the states except Massachusetts and D.C. That election is a whole other story, though.) \n\n**\u2014**\n\n**Summary.**\n\nSo, it was a weird election (and there are even more weird little unmentioned details). Yet, Goldwater's campaign tactics and his policies, despite being maligned as ridiculously far-right, have actually set the precedent for pretty much all of American political history since then. I would include this \"weird election\" among the great political realignments, up there with the formation of the Republican Party and the beginning of the New Deal coalition. It's because of Goldwater that almost all progressives now vote Democratic and almost all conservatives vote Republican. Sadly for those of us who are very interested in Goldwater, it seems that his relevance may just come to an end in this election. Something big is happening this year, and sadly it seems that Barry Goldwater is not going to be so influential anymore. We are seeing the passing of a great age. The leaves are falling from the trees in Rivendell... the elves are going into Valinor... and they will never come back...\n\n****\n\nEDIT: Rephrased a few things in order to add clarity. No information was actually taken away, though.\n\nAlso part of the edit is that I realized that I forgot to mention that this is the election that got Ronald Reagan his start as a politician. (Previously he was just a failed actor. Okay, not really *failed* per se \u2014 he was president of the Screen Actors' Guild at one point \u2014 but never a Jimmy Stewart or a Henry Fonda.) Reagan gave such a good speech in support of Goldwater and appeared so well-suited to speech-making and so ideologically like Goldwater that, after Goldwater's failure in the general election of '64, Reagan managed to win the '66 California gubernatorial election, the election that Nixon had lost in '62 (to Pat Brown, current governor Jerry Brown's father,) and had caused Nixon to claim he was retiring... until, of course, he ran for President in '68 on a similar platform to Goldwater's and won, then ran again in '72 and was the guy who drubbed McGovern so soundly. This sort of thing is why I say that Goldwater was so influential.\n\nAlso also, I accidentally wrote just over half the word count for my paper.

I left my balcony door open one night and a cat got in. Older cat, playful and shit. Was neutered and clean, so someone in the area obviously owned him. I didn't have any pets, couldn't afford them at the time, but i fucking love cats. I fed him, he started visiting, sometimes sleeping over, just generally being a lovable, playful cat.\n\nA couple of months pass and that fucking cat really helps keep my mood up when he comes around.

He jumps on my bed and on me. Little did he know that i was deep in a nightmare. A nightmare in which some BIG cat jumped on me and started attacking me. In the nightmare, i just went for the throat of the cat and started choking it. The cat(in the nightmare) clawed my arms, cut me pretty bad, but i felt like it was my life at stake, so i ignored the pain and just kept squeezing.\n\nI don't know how long that really went on, because the next thing i know i'm in my bed, out of breath, sweaty as fuck, holding the visiting cat by his throat.\n\nIt took me a minute to become fully aware again and i was still holding the cat down(but not choking), still felt confused as fuck about what the hell was going on.\n\nAfter finally realizing what the hell happened, i flipped the cat over(he was on his back), started petting him... and he started purring. I damn near choked the life out of him, and he was still a lovable fat cat.\n\nI don't know what the hell i would've done if i had killed him.\n\nThe pain from the nightmare was real too - i had a couple of nasty gashes on my fists and i still have scarring from them now.\n\nThe cat lived, purred, i fed him one more time that night and he seemed happy & uninjured as he left - but he never came back again.

Rarely  did any one survive that treatment. \n\nTots, were the copper measuring unit cups  that the rum issue was doled out with. Rum was diluted by half with water, so that it couldn't be hoarded. And it had to be consumed in front of the OOD. The Rum was kept in a rum keg, that was guarded continually . The slogan on the rum keg was  God Bless the King. \n\nSaluting. The best known salute is with the hand, raised to the forehead. In the days before seaman wore uniform caps, they saluted by grasping their forelock of hair with their hand, and giving a slight bow, towards the officer. This showed that they had nothing in their hand,  that could be a weapon, and also that they recognised the authority of the office over them. In the later Victorian  era, men would turn their palms inward when saluting, to not show their dirty hands  to the Officer. The  hand salute, in the RN was with the  palm inwards, while the British Army the hand salute was with the palm outwards. Still that way in 2016. \n\nSalutes can also be given with flags , by dipping them, by gun fire (a  number of rounds being fired in salute ) and by voice ( by cheering three times to the sovereign in a fleet royal review ceremony for  example .  . When armed with a sword, a salute can be proffered by an Officer.\n\nJim B.", "id": "d7pm16t"}, {"comment": "Those 50 years of reading history weren't wasted even a little bit!\n  \nThank you, Jim, for passing on these absolutely intriguing facts.

During the second great unpleasantness......There was the real navy and the unreal navy....The unreal navy were the Royal Navy Volunteer  Reserve, who were drawn from the ranks of the merchant marine retired captains. They had thousands of miles  at sea, all over the globe, but no time at all in any naval training college. To say that they were a bit rough around the edges was to be generous. They were known as the Wavy Navy, because of the wavy gold stripes on their uniform jacket   cuffs. \n\nA RN boom vessel, whose job it was to open and close the anti submarine net at the entrance to a UK  harbour, had the unusual name of HMS Virgin.......The  Scottish skipper had a delicious sense of humour, and loved to send blinker messages to incoming RN ships, of all sizes.\n\nA typical signals exchange  HMS  Illustrious approaches (  a RN air craft carrier bloody huge thing, the size of a medium sized country   )  open the gate !  .... HMS Virgin relies.. Only if you buy me dinner first ducky ....\n\nAnother one. Two RCN corvettes are entering Halifax harbour after a long convoy escort run , and the boom control vessel is a bit slow opening the net. The first Corvette sees this and does an emergency \"reverse all engines \". The second ship runs into the stern of the first ship..... hard.\n\nThe first ship makes by signal lamp........ \" If you touch me there again....you will have to marry me \" ......Second ship sends by voice hailer....not if I have anything to do with it.......followed by much laughter on both ships. The Port Commander was not pleased by the need for  the repairs to both ships. \n\n A final one, a RCN Captain who was a bit off at any time, had to be tied to a chair in his cabin by his executive officer, after he came on to the bridge in the middle of the Atlantic, completely nude, except for a pair of Hop along Cassidy  and two real six shooters,  and the matching belt and holsters and cowboy boots. He was quietly sent to a desk job in Saskatchewan , far from the rigours of sea duty. He was later elected Mayor of a small town out there some where.

Otoya Yamaguchi was member of a right-wing ultranationalist Japanese group. Inejiro Asanuma was leader of the socialist party in Japan. He was unusual in postwar Japan for his forceful advocacy of socialism, and his support of the Chinese Communist Party was particularly controversial. Asanuma was assassinated during a televised political debate for the coming elections for the House of Representatives. While Asanuma spoke from the lectern at Tokyo\u2019s Hibiya Hall, Yamaguchi rushed onstage and ran his wakizashi through Asanuma\u2019s abdomen, killing him.  \n  \nOtoya Yamaguchi was a member of a group which, among other things, wished to rid Japan of Western influence and restore Japan\u2019s traditional culture. He chose a weapon that was fitting his purpose, and that meant getting up close and attacking with complete conviction, knowing full well that there was no way he would be getting away.  \n  \nLess than three weeks after the assassination, while being held in a juvenile detention facility, Yamaguchi mixed a small amount of tooth paste with water and wrote on his cell wall: \u201cSeven lives for my country.

Otoya Yamaguchi was member of a right-wing ultranationalist Japanese group. Inejiro Asanuma was leader of the socialist party in Japan. He was unusual in postwar Japan for his forceful advocacy of socialism, and his support of the Chinese Communist Party was particularly controversial. Asanuma was assassinated during a televised political debate for the coming elections for the House of Representatives. While Asanuma spoke from the lectern at Tokyo\u2019s Hibiya Hall, Yamaguchi rushed onstage and ran his wakizashi through Asanuma\u2019s abdomen, killing him.  \n  \nOtoya Yamaguchi was a member of a group which, among other things, wished to rid Japan of Western influence and restore Japan\u2019s traditional culture. He chose a weapon that was fitting his purpose, and that meant getting up close and attacking with complete conviction, knowing full well that there was no way he would be getting away.  \n  \nLess than three weeks after the assassination, while being held in a juvenile detention facility, Yamaguchi mixed a small amount of tooth paste with water and wrote on his cell wall: \u201cSeven lives for my country.

Army officers engaged in provocative attacks\u00a0in Manchuria in attempts to create justification for seizing territory from China. In Japan, ultranationalist military officers led waves of assassinations against political and business leaders to \u201cpurify\u201d Japanese society of the corporate and political party influences that they believed were preventing Japan from attaining its rightful place among nations through Asian expansion.\n\n>The most spectacular episodes were the\u00a0May 15 Incident\u00a0(1932) in which junior navy officers and army cadets assassinated Prime Minister\u00a0Inukai Tsuyoshi\u00a0and the\u00a0February 26 Incident\u00a0(1936) involving 1500 Tokyo troops in a failed coup. Despite criminal prosecutions, in many of the incidents, the defendants' testimony declaring their motives led to widespread public support and most often resulted in comparatively light punishment. While the leaders of the February 26 Incident were subjected to quick secret trials and executions, the episode is widely seen as the last and most serious event leading to the breakdown of party politics and the dominance of the military in Japanese government affairs until the end of World War II.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekokuj%C5%8D\n\nE: Added some links and a shortish description from Wikipedia.", "id": "d2ja8n6"}, {"comment": "There were lots of coups during WW2 Japan too.\n\nThere were a bunch of crazies who tried to stop the surrender even after the nukes + Tokyo firebombing, knowing full well it they had already lost.", "id": "d2jb72z"}, {"comment": "Welp, guess I'm committing a few hours reading up on this now...", "id": "d2jhrcp"}], [{"comment": "I saw a nsfw tag and porn in the subreddit name.\n\nGot something quite different than what i was expecting. interesting picture though.", "id": "d2j8nwd"}, {"comment": "Still got penetration!", "id": "d2j99xd"}, {"comment": "https://youtu.be/mfKTrx2X0-Y?t=39s", "id": "d2jh1nx"}, {"comment": "Yet equally Japanese.", "id": "d2jd1k1"}], [{"comment": "I know it's really too late to comment on this, but look at his right pant leg.

One of these *Marian apparitions* as they are called, happened in Portugal to three Shepherd children near the town of Fatima in 1917, hence Our Lady of Fatima, and the three secrets of Fatima.\n\nNow, the three secrets were kept, well, a secret for quite some time after the apparition, and with two of them being revealed until 1941. And the third secret was not to be released until 1960, and to be kept sealed in an envelope until then. The secret was not revealed to the public until 2000, and it was a pretty big deal, although the text itself is underwhelming. Because people believed that its content was too shocking or apocalyptical for it to be released sooner. Many peole believe the text released isn't the *whole* secret, and that it's so disturbing it's kept for only the eyes of the Holy Father himself and other hihg-ranking church officials. \n\nMany believe the secret is about the coming of the Antichrist, World War III or some End of the World-type event. It's pretty much the Catholic version of a conspiracy theory, and not the first one, or the weirdest one at that. For example, there's this other one about a female pope who gave birth in the middle of mass or something like that (big no-no for catholics).

Jews were an essential go between for early banking in Europe. Switzerland began to develop its banking system and used its Jewish community to do it. However, this helped gain resentment for Jewish bankers from poor Swiss herdsmen (the same way as we now have for bankers). As usury became less and less considered a sin, the Swiss took over the banking. So, all their past resentment for Jewish bankers was now directed a Jews in general and not bankers at all. Swiss Jews would periodically flee after antisemitic incidents like the one in Basel.\n\nDuring the Holocaust Switzerland was the place most western and central European Jews fled to or sent their wealth to. They were not particularly welcomed by the Swiss (who actively tried to keep them out and even sent some back to the Reich), which is the reason they headed for the US or Israel at the first opportunity.

A prime example are honey bees. Out of a bee colony, the overwhelming majority of individuals never reproduces, they are sterile. However their phenotype is beneficial to the species as their behavior help the reproduction rate of the queen and the queen then passes on the genes for their phenotype. This of course is an extreme example of the principle.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that male homosexuality in part is a by-product of increased female reproduction rate, some phenotype caused by genes in the X-chromosome. Every person inherits one X-chromosome from their mother. So gay men inherit their X-chromosome from their mother.\n\nThe maternal female relatives (cousins, aunts and such from the mothers side) of gay men have more offspring than corresponding relatives of straight men, so the women who share the same X-chromosome as the gay male tend to have more offspring.\n\nSo the hypothesis is that something in the X-chromosome increases the reproduction rate of women so much that the side-effect of occasion gay offspring isn't enough to negate the benefits of the allele. Like the allele increase the amount of offspring for women of a population by 15% but via homosexuality reduces the amount of offspring for males of a population by 3%. So while an individual male doesn't reproduce due to the \"gay gene\", the females with the same \"gay gene\" in their X-chromosome benefit from an increased fertility rate and pass the \"gay gene\" to their sons and daughters.\n\n(EDIT: One hypothesis from the hypothesis above was that the \"gay gene\" in the X-chromosome increases the promiscuity of women, makes the women have more \"masculine\" sexuality, increasing their sex drive and the amount of casual sex and thus offspring, and in males this allele increases the chances of homosexuality.\n\nEDIT 2: It has also been hypothesized that some degree of homosexuality in humans has had a social role in our species, similar to our closest relatives bonobo chimpanzees which are a fully bisexual species due to sexual acts being an important way of social interaction within their groups, not just something for reproduction.)", "id": "d8738de"}, {"comment": "When was this?", "id": "d85ellk"}, {"comment": "Before 1973, when it was removed.

For me, another powerful part of the process was the science:  learning that homosexuality is not a choice but rather that it's hard wired in.  One of the great observations made by the gay community came from twenty or so years ago:  God Made Me Gay.  If you're a Christian and understand science, that realization forces acceptance.

But there are plenty of choices people make, and any choice that doesn't burden others should be yours to make as you wish. To make the existence of choice invalidate a position would justify majority tyranny on all manner of things-- religion, politics, whether or not you like sports.\n\nAnd there are plenty of compelling reasons to curtail someone's freedom for reasons they're \"wired for\". \"Dangerous to themselves and others\" behavior can come from genetics, brain injury, or other malformations, and there's no one saying that since it's natural, it's acceptable in society.", "id": "d85pjc7"}, {"comment": "I hear what you're saying and understand your point.  To my mind there are two parts to this.  If someone is hardwired to be sexually attracted to members of his/her own sex, well, that's simply the way he or she is built.  It doesn't matter whether it's genetics, brain injury or something else.  I don't think that's a matter of choice. Given what we know now, the thought of all those people who tried to teach or force homosexuals to becomes heterosexual just boggles the mind.  For this reason, from my perspective, I don't know that I would condemn a person for having urges of whatever sort simply for having those urges.  What that person does though is a matter of choice.  If he/she carries those urges out to the injury of someone else (child molesters, rapists, etc.), that person should be condemned for his/her actions and there's no reason society should not take action to protect its members.  Sometimes the actions are not by choice.  If someone commits murder, e.g., but is clinically insane, by all means he should be taken out of circulation; but it would be hard for me to condemn him for committing the crime if he did not have the mental faculty.  As a final thought, to my mind, consensual sex between two adults of whatever sexual type is none of anyone else's business in the normal course and society should butt out.  (Yes.  There are limited exceptions.  Person A has sex with person C.  If Person B is the spouse of Person A or C, B may have plenty of reason to make it his or her business.

On Sat. night there was a receiving line to meet the Clintons, and as we waited in the long line, we got more and more nervous about meeting the most powerful couple in the world while getting the hairy eyeball from the Secret Service. When it was our turn to shake hands and talk to them, all my friend could get out was some greeting that literally sounded like he was choking.  I did slightly better, and managed to say \"Nice to meet you!\" and said something about being a supporter or the like before we both scurried off mortified.  Hillary, incidentally, seemed cold and hardcore- she scared us more than Bill, who at least gave off the persona of a warm and genuine person.

At the Academy there is 1 brigade which is the United States Corps of Cadets. That brigade is divided into 4 regiments (5 depending on who you ask). One of those regiments has 3 battalions. One of those battalions has 2-3 companies in it. Cadets are assigned to a company and live in a specific area of a specific barracks and hold leadership poisitions in that company unless they distinguish themselves or apply to lead a higher echelon (like a regimental commander spot). Hope that makes sense.\n\nThe highest rank a cadet can attain is First Captain who is the brigade coimmander (6 bars and a star beneath it). From there it goes 6 bars (cadet captain: regimental commanders), 5 bars (cadet captain: regimental XOs/battalion commanders), 4 bars (cadet captain: battalion XOs/ company commanders), 3 Bars (cadet lieutenant: 4th year cadets, platoon leaders, other company level positions), 2 bars (cadet sergeant: third year cadets, squad leaders), 1 bar (cadet corporal: 2nd year cadets, team leaders), no bars (cadet private: first year cadets).\n\nThe guy on the left is a Regimental Cadet Sergeant Major, the identifying feature is the upside down rank and the amount of bars on the bottom chevrons (2 for Battalion, 3 for Regimental, 5 for Brigade). The guy next to him is a cadet captain in the position of Battalion XO (4 bars, whereas a a battalion commander has 5). The guy to his right is then a cadet captain in the position of regimental commander (6 Bars). Lastly, the guy on the far right is either a regimental XO or a Battalion commander.\n\nSorry for the long-winded explanation but its a weird system that even most cadets don't understand.\n\nAs for your second question, after graduation you are obliged to serve in the United States Army as an active duty officer officer for no less than 5 years active, 3 years inactive ready reserve. You incur this service obligation upon returning to classes in your third year of school. If you were to quit the academy at any time before that you would owe the United States government no money what so ever. However, if you are kicked out or decide to leave after that the United States Government can decide to \"recoup\" the education they have given you to the tune of around $400,000 or you will serve it out as an enlisted solider in the active duty army no higher than the rank of E-4 Specialist for somewhere around 4-ish years.

", "id": "d6yi1qa"}, {"comment": "> if you had just seen six months of carnage with nothing seeming to be able to break the stalemate on the western front\n\nThat's not what he'd seen at all. The 1914 fighting was extremely mobile and it only settled down over winter, which was entirely to be expected. The British didn't launch any attacks until March 1915, so when Gallipoli was being planned it was still entirely possible, and expected, that the Western Front would go mobile again in the near future.

That's not what it turned out to be but again, hindsight is 20/20). I disagree that he hadn't seen carnage. The fighting in France and Belgium in the first month of the war was some of the bloodiest months of the war and like nothing these people had ever experienced before. Just because it wasn't static until the last few months of 1914 doesn't mean it wasn't a slaughterhouse as the generals slowly figured out that the old offensive military tactics just left mountains for dead soldiers when put up against the newest machine guns and artillery. In just 1914 there were 32,000 casualties at the start of the war in the rape of Belgium, directly followed by 500,000 casualties in the first battle of the Marne (while at the same time 150,000 casualties on the eastern front). Thats nearly 700,000 dead or wounded in the first month and a half of the war, when it was still a mobile conflict.  That's far more carnage than the British had ever seen. I'm not sure I understand the idea that he hadn't seen carnage any just because the bloodbath was mostly happening to his allies at that point and not his countryman. The sustained carnage on the western front of 1914 was a huge factor in Churchill's idea of attacking in the Mediterranean. Why throw more bodies into the meat grinder in France (especially since both side have been constantly fortifying their lines since October), when you can attack a (perceived to be) weaker German ally, force the German's to go support Turkey and fight on a 3rd front, and as a result relieve pressure on the French by forcing the German's to focus men and resources elsewhere. \n\nAgain, I agree that it wasn't so much about avoiding a stalemate, and I also agree that they probably thought that the spring would see the lines moving more rapidly again.

You can always lift your pivot foot, as long as you shoot or pass before returning it to the floor. Which is why 3 steps is a travel! The first step you put down is your pivot foot, on the second step you lift your pivot foot, if you take a third step the pivot returns to the floor and a traveling violation has occured! \n\nIf you fumble the ball (lose control) you can take as many steps in the world until you regain control of the ball.

This is at a time when these very guns were being used to shoot down Americans.  so this is kind of the equivalent of Emma Stone posing for photographs in an IED factory in Afghanistan.  Americans were displeased, and she was dubbed \"Hanoi Jane\".  It would be one thing to go to a country that your country is at war with and try and bring attention the positive sides of their culture, their land and their people, it is entirely different to appear to be having a grand ole time with their soldiers on their weaponry.  Worth noting is that the picture OP posted shows her making a goofy face with her fingers in here ears as if trying to block out the report of said weapon does imply that she is well aware of where she was sitting, and what happened at such a site.\n\nAnyway, here is what she said about the incident (emphasis mine):\n\n>The Photo of Me on the Gun Site.\n\n>There is one thing that happened while in North Vietnam that I will regret to my dying day\u2014 I allowed myself to be photographed on a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun. I want to, once again, explain how that came about. I have talked about this numerous times on national television and in my memoirs, My Life So Far, but clearly, it needs to be repeated.\n\n>It happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit. It was not unusual for Americans who visited North Vietnam to be taken to see Vietnamese military installations and when they did, they were always required to wear a helmet like the kind I was told to wear during the numerous air raids I had experienced. When we arrived at the site of the anti-aircraft installation (somewhere on the outskirts of Hanoi), there was a group of about a dozen young soldiers in uniform who greeted me. There were also many photographers (and perhaps journalists) gathered about, many more than I had seen all in one place in Hanoi. This should have been a red flag.\n\n>The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day \u2018Uncle Ho\u2019 declared their country\u2019s independence in Hanoi\u2019s Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: \u201cAll men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.\u201d These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.\n\n>The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return. As it turned out I was prepared for just such a moment: before leaving the United States, I memorized a song called Day Ma Di, written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me, overcome on this, my last day, with all that I had experienced during my 2 week visit. What happened next was something I have turned over and over in my mind countless times. Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: **someone (I don\u2019t remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed. I got up, and as I started to walk back to the car with the translator, the implication of what had just happened hit me. \u201cOh my God. It\u2019s going to look like I was trying to shoot down U.S. planes.\u201d I pleaded with him, \u201cYou have to be sure those photographs are not published. Please, you can\u2019t let them be published.\u201d** I was assured it would be taken care of. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. (I didn\u2019t know yet that among the photographers there were some Japanese.)\n\n>It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can\u2019t blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen. It was my mistake and I have paid and continue to pay a heavy price for it. Had I brought a politically more experienced traveling companion with me they would have kept me from taking that terrible seat. I would have known two minutes before sitting down what I didn\u2019t realize until two minutes afterwards; a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever. The gun was inactive, there were no planes overhead, I simply wasn\u2019t thinking about what I was doing, only about what I was feeling, innocent of what the photo implies. But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm. It is certainly painful for me that I, who had spent so much time talking to soldiers, trying to help soldiers and veterans, helping the anti-war movement to not blame the soldiers, now would be seen as being against our soldiers!\n\nEdit:  There are a few more things worth noting:\n\n1. this was not the only controversial things she did while in North Vietnam.\n2. her apologies came decades after the incident, not immediately after, and only after some movies she was working on rand into delays as a result of protests by Vietnam War Veterans groups.", "id": "d55q02q"}, {"comment": "> this was not the only controversial things she did while in North Vietnam.\n\nThe one that has always gotten the most anger among vets that I know is the alleged incident with the POWs.  \n  \nhttp://www.snopes.com/military/fonda.asp\n", "id": "d55vqb9"}, {"comment": "Thank you for posting that, I appreciated the context.", "id": "d58tcij"}, {"comment": "You're welcome.

The South Vietnam government drew support from the US, the Philippines and several other nations.  So while the US was involved in another nations affairs, to say this was US aggression would be a bit much.  Likewise claiming that the North Vietnamese were simply defending their homeland is to gloss over communist aggression.\n\nThe simple truth is that the Vietnam war (like the Korean war before it), was a small part of the larger cold war that grew out of world wars of the early 20th century.  At the end of the 2nd world war, the US and the USSR carved up the 3rd world.  The USSR then embarked on a mission to spread communism and the US decided the best strategy would be to contain it.

Within the picture a lone man stood with arms crossed as hundreds of men and women around him held up their arms in salute and allegiance to the Nazi Party and its leader, Adolph Hitler. Everyone in attendance is showing their undying support for Der Fuhrer by throwing out their very best \u201cSieg Heil.\u201d August Landmesser, grimacing with arms crossed, stood strong and defiant as he showed his disapproval by not displaying support for the Nazi Party. What made this photo and Landmesser\u2019s defiance unique is that it represented the protest of one man, in its most sincere and pure form. The source of Landmesser\u2019s protest, like many great tragedies, starts with a love story.  \n  \nThe story of August Landmesser\u2019s anti-gesture begins, ironically enough, with the Nazi Party. Believing that having the right connections would help land him a job in the pulseless economy, Landmesser joined the Nazi Party in 1931. Little did he know that his heart would soon ruin any progress that his superficial political affiliation might have made. In 1934, Landmesser met Irma Eckler, a Jewish woman, and the two fell deeply in love. Their engagement a year later got him expelled from the party, and their marriage application was denied under the newly enacted racial Nuremberg Laws. They had a baby girl, Ingrid, in October of the same year, and two years later in 1937, the family made a failed attempt to flee to Denmark, where they were apprehended at the border. August was arrested and charged for \u201cdishonoring the race\u201d under Nazi racial law. He argued that neither he nor Eckler knew that she was fully Jewish, and was acquitted on 27 May 1938 for lack of evidence, with the warning that a repeat offense would result in a multi-year prison sentence.  \n  \nThe couple publicly continued their relationship and a month later August Landmesser would be arrested again and sentenced to hard labor for two years in a concentration camp. He would never see his beloved wife again. Eckler was detained by the Gestapo and held at the prison Fuhlsb\u00fcttel, where she gave birth to a second daughter Irene. Their children were initially taken to the city orphanage. Ingrid was later allowed to live with her maternal grandmother; Irene went to the home of foster parents in 1941. Later, after her grandmother\u2019s death in 1953, Ingrid was also placed with foster parents. A few letters came from Irma Eckler until January 1942. It is believed that she was taken to the so-called Bernburg Euthanasia Centre in February 1942, where she was among the 14,000 killed. In the course of post-war documentation, in 1949 she was pronounced legally dead, with a date of 28 April 1942.  \n  \nAugust would be released in 1941 and began work as a foreman. Two years later, as the German army became increasingly mired by its desperate circumstances, Landmesser would be drafted into a penal infantry along with thousands of other men. He would go missing in Croatia where it is presumed he died, six months before Germany would officially surrender. His body was never recovered.

Here are some examples:\n\nPaul says \"the head of the woman is the man,\" meaning that the women are to be subordinate to men. 1 Cor 11:3\n\nIf a woman refuses to cover her head in church, then her her head must be shaved. 1 Cor 11:5-6\n\n\"A man ... is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.\" Cor 11:7\n\n\"Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.\" Cor 11:9", "id": "d6qgj6l"}, {"comment": "In 2 Samuel 11, King David commits adultery with Bathsheba, wife of Uriah.

However, God knows and as is stated in 2 Samuel 11:27 \"... the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.\" So no, adultery is not a crime for women only. In 2 Samuel 12, God goes on to kill the David's child with Bathsheba as punishment.\n\nIt's also worth noting that at the time Jesus gave the speech (which itself is possibly an addendum by the early church), women could *not* divorce their husband.\n\nMatthew 25:1-13 is a parable about being prepared for the coming of the Kingsom of Heaven, something that shows up in other parables as well. It is not in praise of virginity.\n\nIn Matthew 15:21-28 Jesus is referring to the gentiles as dogs. He states he is only here to bring salvation to the Jews \"... I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. (Mt. 15:24).\" But the woman continues to ask for his help, to which he responds, \"... It is not meet to take the children's bread (salvation) and to cast it to the dogs (gentiles, people not of the house of Israel). (Mt. 15:26)\" But the woman asks him again, arguing that even dogs eat their master's crumbs (God's salvation). Impressed by her faith, he exorcises the demon. This passage has nothing to do with making a derogitory mark about the woman being a dog.\n\n1 Corinthians 11:2-16 is a passage where Paul's uses chiasm and parallelism to make an argument for sexual modesty in the form of a head covering. Corinth was known as a city which had problems with sexual promiscuity, and Paul wished to express a call for modesty. As to whether this is appropriate or not, is up for debate.\n\n1 Corinthians 11:11-12 Would appear to state that men and women are, in fact, equal under God. \"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.

She was proprietor of the Madame Walker hair dressing parlors at 108 West 136th Street and other places in the city.

She spent $10,000 every year for the education of young negro men and women in Southern colleges and sent six youths to Tuskegee Institute every year.

He had braces made for his legs, painted black, which he wore under his trousers. His pants were also tailored so the pant legs went down over the tops of his shoes to hide the braces. And he devised a method of \"walking\" where he would balance with a cane in one hand and hold the arm of his son with the other. Using the muscles in his upper body, he would swing first one leg, then the other forward so that he appeared to be walking.  \nFDR and his son practiced this every day for hours to make it look natural and relaxed when it was actually very difficult and painful.\n\nThere is almost no film footage of Roosevelt walking and, I think, only one photograph of him in a wheelchair. The press in those days was more polite about things like that. Roosevelt rewarded them with extraordinary access and lots of press conferences and interviews.\n\nThere was one incident when Roosevelt was standing at a podium giving a speech and his leg braces unlocked and he  collapsed onto the stage. He had to be helped to his feet, then he re-locked the braces and he continued with the speech. Not a single photographer took a picture. It would have been considered extremely rude. And if any photographer *had* snapped a photo of the embarrassed President lying on the floor, no newspaper would have printed it, and the photographer would have been hounded from the profession. Times were different back then.\n\n[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6EB4aZ8DrY) a clip from the *American Experience* documentary on FDR that talks about his walking technique.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add one of my favorite FDR stories here.  \nFor political reasons, Roosevelt wouldn't allow himself to be seen or photographed in a wheelchair, but there was one exception. During World War 2, while he was in Hawaii for a meeting with the Generals and Admirals of the Pacific War, he asked to be taken to the military hospital there to visit the ward of men who had lost arms and legs in the fighting. He made *that* visit in his wheelchair. He didn't make a speech or do anything but smile and wave, but the message was clear. Here was a man who had lost the use of his legs, and he had risen to become President of the United States. They could do the same.   \nClassy move, that.", "id": "d7aawqx"}, {"comment": "Your comment is so interesting, but I think you're missing the elephant in the room.\n\nSince the advent of television, I think it's close to impossible for a cripple to ever become president.

In regards to the Japanese, it is true that Chiang did not want to go to war because he, accurately, assessed that his armies were no match for the Japanese. He also, again accurately, recognized that while militarism was certainly the order of the day by this point in Japanese government, there wasn't actually much in the way of a mood for full war with China. Throughout the period, the escalation came not from the top, but rather from radical elements among the officer corpse. Chiang thus did not see the Japanese as an immediate threat, and thus was relctant to ally with the Communists because he, yet again accurately, recognized that the communists would use this as an excuse to rebuild their now shattered forces.\n\nBut when war actually did start, the KMT devoted their full forces to fighting the Japanese, which can be seen in how the best battalions were utterly chewed up in the early years of the war, and through absolutely brutal verve and brutal fighting were able to halt the Japanese advance. By contrast the Communists, outside of a few campaigns, did very little against the Japanese, and more or less immediately violated their alliance. Mao was a clever leader, and recognized that the IJA and KMT were chewing each other up and used the moment to create a strong base of support, and focused far more resources on that than the rather paltry attempts to fight Japan. And indeed, Mao accurately recognized that the Japanese were a passing threat, and the civil war would be resumed, and there was plenty of reason to consider the KMT not much better than Japan.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why the KMT lost in the end, but the narrative that it did nothing while the Japanese marched through is completely false.", "id": "d7ag663"}], [{"comment": "Damn in one year  Roosevelt will be in different health", "id": "d7ac9mz"}], [{"comment": "Churchill is so done with all this empire shit.", "id": "d7a9xfa"}, {"comment": "Bragging about creating the country of Jordan must have gotten old.

President Pratibha Patil said of Mother Teresa, \"Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of hope to many \u2013 the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families.\"[78]\n\nIndian views on Mother Teresa were not uniformly favourable. Aroup Chatterjee, who was born and raised in Calcutta but lived in London, reports that \"she was not a significant entity in Calcutta in her lifetime\". Chatterjee blames Mother Teresa for promoting a negative image of Calcutta, exaggerating the work done by her Mission, and misusing the funds and privileges at her disposal.[79]\n\nHer presence and profile grated in parts of the Indian political world, as she often opposed the Hindu Right. The Bharatiya Janata Party clashed with her over the Christian Dalits, but praised her in death, sending a representative to her funeral. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, on the other hand, opposed the government's decision to grant her a state funeral. Its secretary Giriraj Kishore said that \"her first duty was to the Church and social service was incidental\" and accused her of favouring Christians and conducting \"secret baptisms\" of the dying.[80][81] In its front page tribute, the Indian fortnightly Frontline dismissed these charges as \"patently false\" and said that they had \"made no impact on the public perception of her work, especially in Calcutta\". Although praising her \"selfless caring\", energy and bravery, the author of the tribute was critical of Mother Teresa's public campaigning against abortion and that she claimed to be non-political when doing so.[82]\n\nIn February 2015, Mohan Bhagwat, leader of the Hindu right-wing organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said that her objective was \"to convert the person, who was being served, into a Christian\"[83] Former RSS spokesperson MG Vaidhya backed Bhagwat's remarks. The party accused the media of \"distorting facts about Bhagwat's remarks\". Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien, CPI leader Atul Anjan and Delhi's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal protested against the remarks.[84]\"", "id": "cydia56"}]]], "4xywr8": ["Two black students are harassed by classmates on their way to school \u2013 Little Rock, Arkansas (1957) [1608 x 1408]", "2016-08-16 14:57:03", 4723, "https://i.redd.it/gismkax06qfx.png", [[1588, "This was less than 60 years ago, i.e. these people are probably in their late or early 70s."], [530, "Looks like a whole bunch of cowards, to me, and two brave men.

The guy was a moron and all he accomplished was to get a lot of people hurt and killed because he was a moron.\n\nSaying he was evil or big or complex is our way of saving face.", "id": "cxyj6w1"}, {"comment": "I am sure the Jewish people can take solace in the fact that the person who orchestrated there near extermination was stupid. ", "id": "cxyjerg"}, {"comment": "Hitler's intelligence really isn't contingent on our self-esteem now is it?", "id": "cxyjg3j"}, {"comment": "I thought evil acts were caused by an inability to feel empathy.", "id": "cxzym6b"}, {"comment": "Not exactly, because there's nothing particularly special about evil acts in the absence of empathy.\n\nFor example, people with Aspergers have a capacity for empathy, but their ability to sense other's emotions is very low without deliberate practice because of a sensory issue, which nets in very low empathy. Yet they tend to be extremely peaceful, even to the point of getting taken advantage of. Many wouldn't hurt a fly literally.\n\nEvil acts are generally caused by projective identification. \"I feel therefore you are,\" is the name of that game.\n\nEnvy is one of the best examples of this. \"I like X, therefore you're a bad person.\" In envy, person \"A\" thinks person \"B\" is trying very hard to one-up them in a task, out to defeat them, is haughty, and is rude. Person \"B\" can be unaware of person \"A\"s feelings or values completely. Person \"B\" simply *is* one-upping \"A\" without pretense, emotion, or thought in the eyes of \"A\" because they really are better at the task and don't find it important. \"A\" roils in the *perceived* ignorance and arrogance of \"B\", seeing their ease as showing off, and interpreting their friendliness as scornful mocking and condescension that's actual. \"A\" is mistaking their emotions for totally real to everybody and obviously true, factoring in nobody else. To others, \"A\" looks like (s)he claims to read minds and anticipates that others can also. In reality \"A\" is stupid to what other people feel, but not for lack of empathy, rather by extreme levels of empathy towards themselves. If caught, \"A\" is seen self-absorbed and \"selfish\", although \"A\"s thinking is self-destructive and pointless and feuding.\n\nPerson \"A\" is like this because they're stupid and don't know the difference between what is perceived, shared, and actual, or why they even have these objectives in the first place (which make \"B\" a bad guy) and they tend to believe that objectives are universal and not personal (poor boundaries), which is why they tend not to learn from \"B\" or seek any kind of understanding (\"A\" is insecure and just wants to win and prove to themselves, not actually complete the task well). The \"A\" mindset requires a staggering level of pretension which is recursively self-frustrating, so if you asked \"A\" to understand they might scoff at you, \"I *do* understand!\" and accuse the world, ultimately, of not understanding because \"A\" doesn't understand and sees their own personal deficits as a consequence of others.\n\nAn aside: Teens do this on their way to establishing a post-pubescent identity. It has similar features and feelings but is constructive for many. Some never grow out of it, but they tend to have been kids who were always that way.\n\nAnyway this is exactly what Hitler saw in the Jews. He portrayed them as *intentionally* annoying Germans and rejecting their culture, when the Jews weren't deliberately being separatist, they just were and had been a diaspora for millennia. He saw conspiracies where there were none. He saw them as contaminants, not different, because he couldn't understand them being himself blithering idiot. Hitler didn't know that he had emotions, and so didn't regulate them and only applied them as deep insights into reality that nobody else had. These types are always extreme because they don't perceive their emotions as theirs, so they don't regulate them, they respond to them. Delusion is common.\n\nSo evil acts aren't about a lack of empathy, but an excess of trust in one's thoughts and emotions as absolute truths. Sound stupid? It is. In successful people, it looks like madness as they self-reinforce. In unsuccessful people, it looks like misery as they begin to create a personal fable as to why they're failing and who's fault that is. There has to be a man behind the curtain because bad luck or needing to learn isn't an option, as the primary pretension is that they're totally experiencing reality for what it is and perfectly understanding *it* and not themselves. Therefore, there is always a Satan, an external personification of their own perceived failure; therefore, there is always abusing. Even in the successful ones, except their scapegoating and abuse is just bigger and can be aimed at nations or peoples, because they can project their stupidity more broadly.\n\nMake no mistake that any abuser would be willing to blame an entire nation for their bad attitude, and do something about them.", "id": "cy0bq5l"}], [{"comment": "[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler#/media/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1989-0322-506,_Adolf_Hitler,_Kinderbild_retouched.jpg)", "id": "cxxfyzs"}], [{"comment": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcKX0L2xIX4", "id": "cxxiala"}], [{"comment": "And to think he went to the same school as Wittgenstein...", "id": "cxymt0c"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cxxgj01"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cxxp7ls"}, {"comment": "Say what you will about his ideologies, he was an amazing leader.

Kennedy, is shot to death by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner.\n\nOn November 22, President Kennedy was fatally shot while riding in an open-car motorcade through the streets of downtown Dallas. Less than an hour after the shooting, Lee Harvey Oswald killed a policeman who questioned him on the street. Thirty minutes after that, he was arrested in a movie theater by police. Oswald was formally arraigned on November 23 for the murders of President Kennedy and Officer J.D. Tippit. On November 24, Oswald was brought to the basement of the Dallas police headquarters on his way to a more secure county jail. A crowd of police and press with live television cameras rolling gathered to witness his departure. As Oswald came into the room, Jack Ruby emerged from the crowd and fatally wounded him with a single shot from a concealed .38 revolver. Ruby, who was immediately detained, claimed that rage at Kennedy\u2019s murder was the motive for his action. Some called him a hero, but he was nonetheless charged with first-degree murder.\n\nJack Ruby, originally known as Jacob Rubenstein, operated strip joints and dance halls in Dallas and had minor connections to organized crime. He also had a relationship with a number of Dallas policemen, which amounted to various favors in exchange for leniency in their monitoring of his establishments. He features prominently in Kennedy-assassination theories, and many believe he killed Oswald to keep him from revealing a larger conspiracy. In his trial, Ruby denied the allegation and pleaded innocent on the grounds that his great grief over Kennedy\u2019s murder had caused him to suffer \u201cpsychomotor epilepsy\u201d and shoot Oswald unconsciously. The jury found him guilty of the \u201cmurder with malice\u201d of Oswald and sentenced him to die. In October 1966, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the decision on the grounds of improper admission of testimony and the fact that Ruby could not have received a fair trial in Dallas at the time. In January 1967, while awaiting a new trial, to be held in Wichita Falls, Ruby died of lung cancer in a Dallas hospital.\n\nThe official Warren Commission report of 1964 concluded that neither Oswald nor Ruby were part of a larger conspiracy, either domestic or international, to assassinate President Kennedy. Despite its seemingly firm conclusions, the report failed to silence conspiracy theories surrounding the event, and in 1978 the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in a preliminary report that Kennedy was \u201cprobably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy\u201d that may have involved multiple shooters and organized crime.

He also had a relationship with a number of Dallas policemen, which amounted to various favors in exchange for leniency in their monitoring of his establishments. He features prominently in Kennedy-assassination theories, and many believe he killed Oswald to keep him from revealing a larger conspiracy. In his trial, Ruby denied the allegation and pleaded innocent on the grounds that his great grief over Kennedy\u2019s murder had caused him to suffer \u201cpsychomotor epilepsy\u201d and shoot Oswald unconsciously. The jury found him guilty of the \u201cmurder with malice\u201d of Oswald and sentenced him to die. In October 1966, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the decision on the grounds of improper admission of testimony and the fact that Ruby could not have received a fair trial in Dallas at the time. In January 1967, while awaiting a new trial, to be held in Wichita Falls, Ruby died of lung cancer in a Dallas hospital.\n\nThe official Warren Commission report of 1964 concluded that neither Oswald nor Ruby were part of a larger conspiracy, either domestic or international, to assassinate President Kennedy. Despite its seemingly firm conclusions, the report failed to silence conspiracy theories surrounding the event, and in 1978 the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in a preliminary report that Kennedy was \u201cprobably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy\u201d that may have involved multiple shooters and organized crime. The committee\u2019s findings, as with those of the Warren Commission, continue to be widely disputed.\n", "id": "d3l0oii"}, {"comment": "Your work is amazing.

The term conspiracy theory has a derogatory meaning, denoting explanations that invoke conspiracies without warrant, often producing hypotheses that contradict the prevailing understanding of historical events or simple facts.\n\n >According to the political scientist Michael Barkun, conspiracy theories rely on the view that the universe is governed by design, and embody three principles: nothing happens by accident, nothing is as it seems, and everything is connected.

And that was the last letter I ever got from him.\"[55] Not long before Ruby died, according to an article in the London Sunday Times, he told psychiatrist Werner Teuter that the assassination was \"an act of overthrowing the government\" and that he knew \"who had President Kennedy killed.\" He added: \"I am doomed.

If he knew he was dying of cancer, how would the people supposedly paying Oswald know that?  How would they know he would be willing to be arrested and executed, where the only way he would take it is if he had nothing to lose? They wouldn't know that.  And so he wouldn't have known about such an offer, even if there was one. \n\nSo, that only leaves rage and a desire for notoriety.  \n\nOn his other hand, there was no point in shooting Oswald when he's going to be executed anyway. What for? It's the same result, so you're not changing anything or affecting the outcome either way. \n\nHe wouldn't have gone through all those steps for nothing.  Or maybe he didn't plan it at all. Maybe he was always armed because that's how he rolled, due to all the cash he was always having to carry for all his cash-based businesses.  And over the many years of running seedy joints and strip clubs and having to deal with equally seedy and sometimes armed customers, competitors as well as all the other antagonists that come with those businesses, he had probably become pretty quick on the draw, and had become used to using his gun on the slightest impulse.\n\nSo, when he was standing amongst the crowd getting riled up and angry with everyone else, and people were shouting at Oswald and shaking their fists in frustration, wishing they could get their hands on the bastard so they could do something about it, in a fit of rage, one man suddenly realized that he could do something about it, and followed through with that impulse.  \n\nAnger is a powerful drug. But just like Oswald, he was already used to pointing a gun at people and deciding whether or not they should live, so it wasn't like he had to ponder over the decision.  \n\nSame way with Oswald:  as a former professional sniper who was used to making life and death decisions about people, all he needed to do was to decide whether or not he wanted Kennedy around.

They were all properly dressed in the field uniform of the U.S. Army and carried no civilian clothes.[1][2] Their objective was to demolish a tunnel at Framura on the important railroad line between La Spezia and Genoa. Two days later, the group was captured by a party of Italian Fascist soldiers and members of the German Heer. \n\n>The captured U.S. soldiers were interrogated and one officer revealed the story of the mission. The information, including that it was a commando raid, was then sent to Dostler at the 75th Army Corps.\n\n>Dostler sent a telegram to the 135th Fortress Brigade ordering that the captured soldiers be executed. This order was an implementation of Hitler's secret Commando Order of 1942, which required the immediate execution without trial of commandos and saboteurs.\n\n>German officers at the 135th Fortress Brigade contacted Dostler in an attempt to achieve a delay of their execution. Dostler sent another telegram ordering Almers to carry out the execution. Two last attempts were made by the officers at the 135th to stop the execution, including some by telephone, because they knew that executing uniformed prisoners of war was a direct violation of the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.

The fun part is not knowing if the bullets will actually hit the heart cleanly and result in a quick death. Sometimes the bullets will miss the heart completely, so all you get is massive internal bleeding resulting in death by loss of blood instead of sudden organ failure.

This photo shows how human this \u201cmonster\u201d was, like Hitler with his German Shepherd or smiling with his maniac cohorts.  \n  \nAccording to witnesses he enjoyed billiards, liked playing games with children, flirted with the wives of colleagues, drank too much, had a weakness for bananas. He was an avid gardener, proud of his roses and lemons. He loved to screen John Ford westerns and especially the movie \u201cIt Happened One Night\u201d. And when he wanted to charm, he charmed. When Stalin incorrectly pronounced a word, everyone who spoke after him took great care to make the same mistake.  \n  \nEven his sense of humor smelt of tyranny. He transformed his colleagues into frightened toadies, then amused himself by ridiculing their eagerness to please. And he found it amusing, during the Great Terror of the later 1930s, that people often confessed, under torture, to crimes which they could not have committed. Sebag Montefiore tells an anti-Stalin joke: The leader loses his trademark pipe, complains about missing it, then finds it under a sofa. Lavrenti Beria, head of the police force and chief liquidator, says \u201cThis is impossible! Three people have already confessed to this crime!\u201d What makes the joke more than a joke is that Stalin loved to tell it.  \n  \nBeginning in 1931, Vlasik was chief of Stalin\u2019s personal protective service in Kremlin. He also became, in essence, a member of the family. But that not saved him from the Stalin\u2019s purge in connection with the Doctors\u2019 plot (in 1952). After Stalin died in 1953, he was released from a gulag.  \n  \nIn the memoirs of Stalin\u2019s daughter, Svetlana Allilueva, she characterizes Vlasik as an \u201cilliterate, silly, rough and extremely impudent despot\u201d. As she said he was so corrupted with authority, that \u201che began to dictate to art workers and arts, tastes of comrade Stalin\u201d, and \u201c\u2026figures listened and followed his councils. Any celebratory concert at the Big Theatre or Georgia\u2019s Hall did not take place without the sanction of Vlasik\u201d.  \n  \nIn his memoirs Vlasik wrote:  \n> *\"I was severely offended by Stalin. For 25 years of doing an excellent job, receiving nothing but encouragement and awards, I was excluded from the Party and flung into prison. For my boundless fidelity he gave me into the charge of my enemies.

This photo shows how human this \u201cmonster\u201d was, like Hitler with his German Shepherd or smiling with his maniac cohorts.  \n  \nAccording to witnesses he enjoyed billiards, liked playing games with children, flirted with the wives of colleagues, drank too much, had a weakness for bananas. He was an avid gardener, proud of his roses and lemons. He loved to screen John Ford westerns and especially the movie \u201cIt Happened One Night\u201d. And when he wanted to charm, he charmed. When Stalin incorrectly pronounced a word, everyone who spoke after him took great care to make the same mistake.  \n  \nEven his sense of humor smelt of tyranny. He transformed his colleagues into frightened toadies, then amused himself by ridiculing their eagerness to please. And he found it amusing, during the Great Terror of the later 1930s, that people often confessed, under torture, to crimes which they could not have committed. Sebag Montefiore tells an anti-Stalin joke: The leader loses his trademark pipe, complains about missing it, then finds it under a sofa. Lavrenti Beria, head of the police force and chief liquidator, says \u201cThis is impossible! Three people have already confessed to this crime!\u201d What makes the joke more than a joke is that Stalin loved to tell it.  \n  \nBeginning in 1931, Vlasik was chief of Stalin\u2019s personal protective service in Kremlin. He also became, in essence, a member of the family. But that not saved him from the Stalin\u2019s purge in connection with the Doctors\u2019 plot (in 1952). After Stalin died in 1953, he was released from a gulag.  \n  \nIn the memoirs of Stalin\u2019s daughter, Svetlana Allilueva, she characterizes Vlasik as an \u201cilliterate, silly, rough and extremely impudent despot\u201d. As she said he was so corrupted with authority, that \u201che began to dictate to art workers and arts, tastes of comrade Stalin\u201d, and \u201c\u2026figures listened and followed his councils. Any celebratory concert at the Big Theatre or Georgia\u2019s Hall did not take place without the sanction of Vlasik\u201d.  \n  \nIn his memoirs Vlasik wrote:  \n> *\"I was severely offended by Stalin. For 25 years of doing an excellent job, receiving nothing but encouragement and awards, I was excluded from the Party and flung into prison. For my boundless fidelity he gave me into the charge of my enemies. But never, for any minute of the condition I was in, to whatever mockeries I was exposed while in prison, had I in my soul any malice against Stalin\u201d*  \n  \n*Written by RHP*", "id": "d2uya7d"}, {"comment": "> flirted with the wives of colleagues\n\ncan't imagine how terrifying having him flirt with you or seeing him flirt with your partner must be", "id": "d2v3q92"}, {"comment": "According to one documentary I watched, Stalin's 'flirting' consisted of throwing bits of food at other women when at dinner in his drunken state.
