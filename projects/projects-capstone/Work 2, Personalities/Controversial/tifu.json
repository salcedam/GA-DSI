For example, humans, raccoons, and cyotes all share the same part in the brain called the Hematical Sphere which helps process vision at night. With raccoons, however, the bone structure of their hands are completely identical to that of humans with every bone accounted for whereas with chimps, they are missing all of the distal phalanges that we share.

The bigger person always tries to defuse or walk away, not to give the message it's ok to hit but cuz we judge how smart we are by our brains, keeping your cool takes a ton more strength. Anyone can lose their shit & you're mad for them hitting you yet you sink to their level & do the same?? I don't see the intellect here. \n\nFinally, you are really lucky. Idk what part of South America you're in but that area can be brutally nasty & you never know who you're messing with. You're correct to believe it's 100% okay to defend yourself.

That was the first day I realized that I have to do everything, EVERYTHING myself and that I cannot rely on other people, especially the police. \n\nSo, I waited for the guy to come out of the house (the guy who stole my car) and I beat the shit out of him. \n\nI don't care if it was \"just a girl\" that hits you. If you hit someone you WILL get hit back. Women should not assume they are immune from this. \n\nAnd, here's the real kicker, if you DO call the police you're more likely to get arrested than the girl who just hit you. \n\nAgain, I don't know if you've been sheltered, but the rest of us live in the real fucking world.

Thinking about it this morning I do believe she did hit me more than once the first time, but I can say with 100% confidence.

She smacked me hard enough in the face that my head turned so fast that my glasses fell off my face.

My opinion changes in the respect that she kept swinging at you after the first hit (from her). Unfortunately, the guards came after, or maybe *both* of you would have been hauled out of the club.  Like I mentioned before, if the police are involved, I really hope that none of what happened comes back to haunt you. \n\nMy perspective comes from being assaulted while I was in college (I am a woman, and another woman was my assailant).  Long story short, she confronted me first over a misunderstanding, I yelled back \"Don't embarrass yourself\" and walked away, but she pursued me.  Because she put her hands on me and almost pushed me down a flight of stairs, my adrenaline kicked in more to steady myself so that I didn't fall.  I reported it to the campus police the same day and they told me I was within my rights to press charges.  When it went to court, the judge looked at us both like fools and told us that it was a cat fight.  He blamed me for \"egging her on\" since I told her not to embarrass herself, which I felt was completely unfair.  She apologized to me (it was all bullshit), and the case was dismissed.\n\nStill in all, you can't take back what happened and I feel you were justified in protecting yourself.  When did all of this happen?", "id": "cy4xu9b"}], [{"comment": ">She picks up a glass and chucks it at me striking me in the face again. So what do I do? I got up and smack her across the face hard enough to send her into the next room and onto the ground (Once again, open handed. I didn't punch her). This is followed by about 4 security guards tackling me, picking me up, and carrying me down three flights of stairs and out of the club.\n\nLook at this from the security guards' perspective.

The sooner you accept that, the better off you'll be. \n\nWhether you can rationalize your right to hit her back or not isn't the real issue. The better response would have been to de-escalate, restrain, etc. You know it would have. The real issue isn't whether it's ever acceptable to hit a girl, it's was it necessary to escalate this fight?

It's that his god damn father that did that. I've stopped talking to my parents for less than that. I would ban from my life anyone doing that to me.\n\nOP, you deserve it all, for being a shitty individual, not let alone a father, for not being able to understand that being guilty has to be decided by a jury and no one else.\n\n@OP's son: Go away from these people, as far as you can financially.", "id": "czx6eaj"}], [{"comment": "You fucked up real bad.\nI hope your son forgives you, because if I were him I would never be able to.", "id": "czx6dwr"}], [{"comment": "But what happened to the girl, she never went to jail for falsely accusing him, she never had to pay for what she caused this boy.

Quickly choosing a side without proper evidence will definitely lead to some hurt butts. This isn't something that *completely* ruins his life though.

I look through the peephole and see two men in suits and I'm like fuck they might be PI's (Private Investigators). I tell my friend what I see and he's just stuck staring into oblivion like I had told him aliens had just landed on his balcony. \n\nI then realize they were Mormons, so not wanting to be an asshole I open the door and they proceed to engage in conversation.  I apologize to them for taking so long and blamed it on my moms homemade chili from the previous night. So there I am standing in my friends doorway while I'm talking to two Mormons stoned out of my mind. I don't remember what we talked about besides me telling them my views on religion. They asked me if they could come back to talk to my parents and I said sure. I told them next week around the same time should be ideal. So they leave and I explain to my friend they were just Mormons. We burst into laughter about how much we were tripping. Here's the good part. \n\nThe Mormons show up next week at my friends place and he's hotboxing alone in his room. They knock on the door and he goes to it thinking it isn't anything to worry about. But he was so fried that he thought they were cops! So he's sitting there tripping out while Mormons are on the other side knocking on the door.

I was assigned a project that I knew nothing about - architect and deploy an Endpoint Management solution using Altiris (now Symantec). I got my certification and shortly after that I landed a position that I honestly barely knew anything about. I learned a ton from my colleague and by just working.

Fast forward to present day \u2013 I am an IT Site Manager at a very prominent biotech company. Not having a college education has never held me back from getting any job I wanted. This is because I am very specialized and I have a lot more experience than anyone fresh out of college. I\u2019m 34 now and make $125,000 and have $0 in student loans. Going to college IMO is worthless for IT because the technology changes so fast. There are so many free resources online and/or week-long boot camp courses that would benefit you much more.\n\nI suggest finding something to specialize in that interests you and is in demand.

Or you can focus on being healthy, keep in mind that the future isn't written yet, and growing as a person every day no matter how hard it is. Neither path will be easy, but one leads to a healthy positive life where you can be successful and have good self esteem, and the other suicide. \n\nI'm sure other redditors will chime in with lots of resources and help you can get for your situation. Take a GED class at a community college to learn what you skipped. Find a job that is a good fit for you and makes accommodations gladly and not grudgingly because they have to. If you want to learn, grow as a person, and take good care of yourself everything will end up ok, but it won't be easy. If you fall into the trap of constantly dwelling on what could have been you'll never be able to move forwards. Easier said than done, but you can do it if you really want to.\n\nPlus you'd be shocked how many people hit college not knowing a GD thing. \n\nEDIT: So let me preface this by saying I don't mean to imply anything here. That said physical health impacts your mental health. Will the endorphins released from exercise and healthy living magically fix your problems, no not at all. They will make it easier to handle though. Plus exercise can be a great emotional release and it sounds like you have a lot you need to get out. And the other side of that coin is will being overweight / obese and in otherwise poor physical health make you depressed and cause the problems you have, no absolutely not. But it will make it all a lot harder to deal with. \n\nAgain best of luck for you and don't be afraid to reach out to people for help. \n\nTry not to blame your parents too much. There is no manual on how to raise kids. If an irresponsible doctor prescribes an 8 year old amphetamines and your parents didn't know better that's one thing. If they shopped around until they could find one who would clear cut your brain with drugs that's another. But either way it's the past and you should try to not let it control you."], [3, ">I had to get a 80% or I was grounded and had to take the lessons over again.\n\nThat's not a bad thing. It's how you learn. \n\nDo a thing. Is it perfect? No? Do it again better. Was it perfect this time? Yes? Good, move onto a harder version of the thing. Repeat until someone will pay you to do that thing for them because they need it done and you're better at doing it than they are.\n\nGranted, grounding a kid over every assignment is a bit harsh, but insisting on perfection (and honestly, 80% isn't perfect. Nobody's okay with not crashing their car on only 80% of drives) is not a bad thing. "], [3, "Kind of a random question, how did you figure out you were gay?  My brain doesn't seem to be connecting it with your other mentionings."], [3, "For what it's worth, there is a high comorbidity with narcolepsy and ADD/ADHD. In fact my narcolepsy was hidden because I actually have ADD and the Ritalin I take was having the added benefit of keeping me awake. Ritalin is actually prescribed to treat mild narcolepsy anyways. "], [3, "I have narcolepsy too! Funny thing is, they just put me on adderall so basically what you had your whole life was being treated almost correctly for you. Good luck bud. "], [3, "This story really spoke to me because I thought you were literally telling my story until I you said you were *literally* cheating. I thought you meant that you felt that by using adderall for you ADHD you felt like you were cheating or whatever. I sort of used to feel like that because I used to do well in school until I started to not do well in school. Then I got adderall and it made it better and I felt like adderall was cheating a bit.\n\nI have ADD and also have significant problems with daytime sleepiness. I was diagnosed with depression (rightly so) and whenever I had bouts of excessive sleepiness my Psychiatrist would just increase my Adderall or my anti-depressants saying that it was a symptom of depression. \n\nNow that I'm an adult, I moved away and had to switch psychiatrists and low and behold, he tells me its not normal to suddenly fall asleep on the couch to take a nap for 6 hours or to sleep every night for 10 hours and be fucking exhausted every day or when my Adderall wears off at 4 in the afternoon I almost fall asleep driving home from work.\n\nHe sent me to a sleep specialist and I was tested for both narcolepsy and sleep apnea. I tested positive for sleep apnea and now I have the machine which is taking a while to get used to. \n\nAnyway, what I'm trying to get at with all that is - I get where you're coming from diagnoses-wise. However, I'm not quite on the same page in understanding the issue with the cheating issue. I do sometimes wonder if I really do have ADD at all or if the attention deficit and memory issues were caused by the lack of decent sleep. I'm also not overweight and I don't snore so it never occurred to me that I might have sleep apnea.\n\nWhat I think you should do at this point is try to get a good hold of your health. Get a primary care physician that can help you manage all of these things and make sure all of your doctors know about all of your diagnoses and medications and stuff. Try getting a primary care physician to look at the whole picture. \n\nIn the meantime, it might not be a bad idea to try to get your associate's degree part time at a community college. The requirements for getting your associates degree cover everything you should have learned in high school plus the first half of a full 4-year degree.\nPlus, before you start taking classes they usually have you complete some sort of test to see how well you perform. You might end up having to take some remedial math courses based on how well you do but that will get your started in the right direction. I wouldn't mention the cheating thing, they won't look kindly upon that.\n\nEDIT: It's 3 hours later and I just reread this. There are so many mistakes and its kinda rambling.

Sadly most people in college don't really work hard they think you learn the same in college as high school.  Work really really hard in college and about in a month you'll be smarter than most everyone.  Like there is that big of a learning gap I shit you not.

There's nothing I can do to change the past, but hopefully my story can help support others who have similar issues with staying awake and feel trapped. TIFU isn't for getting advice, it's for letting people know you fucked up... and I did.\n\nYou can and should blame your parents. They're responsible for your health and well-being when you are in their control. The signs of your problems should have been blaringly obvious to your parents, especially since you cheated and lied to them for years and they apparently didn't notice. Having a child, who is being home schooled, cheat and lie to you day in and day out should not go unnoticed unless they were willingly blind to the signs, or are just not very invested in their child. If your parents claim ignorance, that's trying to take the easy way out and avoiding responsibility (as they've shown they're very experienced in avoiding responsibility). Ignorance isn't an excuse, ever. \n\nBelieving that you can't blame your parents is not only wrong, but unjust. You should have been medically tested repeatedly until your sleep problem was helped. "], [3, "Sleep apnea is very commonly misdiagnosed as ADHD, especially in children. There are plenty of ways to get it treated, as easy as an occlusal guard to hold your jaw open a certain way to open your airway or even getting actual structure removed that block your airway. Try talking to your dentist the next time you go in for a cleaning, small things can make a lot of difference. \n\nAlso, diagnosing yourself isn't the smartest thing to do.

I watched other parents with kids with the same disability take a passive role in their child's care, and felt really sorry for their kids who weren't doing very well.\n\nI think you used every coping mechanism available to you. It sounds like your parents tried to help but didn't really get it right, they were really tough on you (80% minimum ?) and that may have set you up to naturally be tough on yourself.

The provigil does basically nothing for my bro without the xyrem, because the xyrem is what makes sure you stay asleep and get to REM.

Do not take more than you're supposed to either.\n\nThere's been some promising research on new therapies to so in the next 10-15 years there might be something better, since xyrem and provigil are still just treating symptoms and not the disease itself.

You did what you had to do to. You should look at it from a different perspective - you got lucky. Let me explain\n\nI was in a similar situation, minus the sleep issues. My parents pulled me out of school after 8th grade and I was homeschooled via a correspondence school. It was too easy for me so I did nothing and faked all of the work I had to turn into the Board of Education. I got my GED and decided to go into IT because I was always a nerd, but mostly because I knew I could make money.\n\nI never went to college, but I took an MCSE course at 16 and got a job as a PC Tech at Best Buy (pre-Geek Squad). At 18 I got a job as a help desk technician as a government contractor. Two years later I was promoted to Network Administrator. I was assigned a project that I knew nothing about - architect and deploy an Endpoint Management solution using Altiris (now Symantec). I got my certification and shortly after that I landed a position that I honestly barely knew anything about. I learned a ton from my colleague and by just working. You don\u2019t have to know everything to land a job \u2013 you just need the desire, know how to find the answers, and most importantly, ask questions.\n\nEventually I started consulting \u2013 I still felt like I had no idea what I was doing, and I still feel that way sometimes to this day. Fast forward to present day \u2013 I am an IT Site Manager at a very prominent biotech company. Not having a college education has never held me back from getting any job I wanted. This is because I am very specialized and I have a lot more experience than anyone fresh out of college. I\u2019m 34 now and make $125,000 and have $0 in student loans. Going to college IMO is worthless for IT because the technology changes so fast. There are so many free resources online and/or week-long boot camp courses that would benefit you much more.\n\nI suggest finding something to specialize in that interests you and is in demand. If you want to stay in IT, I recommend what I do. Look into Microsoft SCCM, Dell KACE, Altiris, Puppet, etc. You\u2019re still really young and you have your whole career ahead of you. I've been scared shitless of every job I've landed but that's what drive me to do better. If you aren't scared or nervous, it's not the right job for you.\n\nBTW, I legitimately have ADHD and I take Adderall. It\u2019s not cheating and your friends are terrible for making you feel that. Also I\u2019m female and it\u2019s definitely been way more difficult to get respect in a male dominated industry so you already have an advantage.\n\nFeel free to PM me for more details.\n\ntl;dr \u2013 I have my GED, no college, started working at 16, worked my way up in my career by specializing in a specific IT skill, currently make $125k and have no student loans.

I could never study for more than 15 minutes without getting distracted.

Every test I took that required concentration or solving multi-step problems I would fail or come close.  Despite achieving extraordinarily high marks on standardized tests (which are way too easy in the US imo), I still failed these sorts of tests.  I had severe anxiety from constantly feeling as though I was a disappointment to my parents. resulting in excruciating migraines.  When I went to college everything got worse.  The pressure my parents put on me to study was no longer there and I started smoking weed to help with the migraines and anxiety.  It was a crutch, and I was constantly high just to escape from the anxiety and pain.  Eventually I got arrested and my grades were too low to retain my scholarship.  The overarching shame of the whole ordeal along with the impaired judgement from being high or drunk 24/7 led me to attempt suicide.  I realized during the attempt that this was the low point of my life, and that the worst my parents could do was be angry that I hadn't told them about everything sooner.  The next day I told them everything (besides the suicide attempt) and carried on.  I still struggled in school for the next 2 semesters until last semester when I took a psych class.  We did an exercise where we \"diagnosed\" tv show characters (like Bart Simpson and Michael Scott) from a mini DSM.

I was constantly tired, exhausted, drained, and whenever I sat still for any amount of time I fell asleep.\n\nUnfortunately my parents were assholes and didn't bother to try and get me medical attention and simply guilt tripped me saying I was \"lazy\" or whatever.  I internalized it and really thought I was lazy so I worked twice as hard thinking everyone else felt the same way as I did.  Now, in my early 30s, I've had two life crippling physical breakdowns from overworking myself half to death.  It was because of these breakdowns I discovered what was wrong with me.\n\nMy point is that accepting your issues is *not weakness*.  Who cares what everyone *thinks* about how you feel, *they don't understand, they physically can't understand, and they never will understand*.  You have to do what's right for you and if your health doesn't allow it simply forcing yourself because of what someone else thinks will only drive you to the grave sooner.\n\n2) For the love of *Christ* and all that is holy, get some better medical attention... starting with an MRI and/or a CAT scan of your brain.\n\nI had a friend who had the same problem when he was young.

I'm also not overweight and I don't snore so it never occurred to me that I might have sleep apnea.\n\nWhat I think you should do at this point is try to get a good hold of your health. Get a primary care physician that can help you manage all of these things and make sure all of your doctors know about all of your diagnoses and medications and stuff. Try getting a primary care physician to look at the whole picture. \n\nIn the meantime, it might not be a bad idea to try to get your associate's degree part time at a community college. The requirements for getting your associates degree cover everything you should have learned in high school plus the first half of a full 4-year degree.\nPlus, before you start taking classes they usually have you complete some sort of test to see how well you perform. You might end up having to take some remedial math courses based on how well you do but that will get your started in the right direction. I wouldn't mention the cheating thing, they won't look kindly upon that.\n\nEDIT: It's 3 hours later and I just reread this. There are so many mistakes and its kinda rambling.

There's nothing I can do to change the past, but hopefully my story can help support others who have similar issues with staying awake and feel trapped. TIFU isn't for getting advice, it's for letting people know you fucked up... and I did.\n\nYou can and should blame your parents. They're responsible for your health and well-being when you are in their control. The signs of your problems should have been blaringly obvious to your parents, especially since you cheated and lied to them for years and they apparently didn't notice. Having a child, who is being home schooled, cheat and lie to you day in and day out should not go unnoticed unless they were willingly blind to the signs, or are just not very invested in their child. If your parents claim ignorance, that's trying to take the easy way out and avoiding responsibility (as they've shown they're very experienced in avoiding responsibility). Ignorance isn't an excuse, ever. \n\nBelieving that you can't blame your parents is not only wrong, but unjust. You should have been medically tested repeatedly until your sleep problem was helped.

Perimeter braking, that is, making the brake rotor the size of the wheel rim, and attached to it, is a thing for a reason.  driveshaft braking is usually only used for parking brake use.  even modern cars with four wheel disc often have a little drum at each rear wheel, cable operated, for a parking brake.

If driveshaft brakes were used to stop a truck moving 65mph the differential would grenade.\n\nConcerning ratios and torgue, it's the ideal place to put it though. Think about speed, momentum and torque. Larger diameter brakes are better than small diameter brakes because there is less torque involved.

Soy down and seriously think about whether you want to continue with the BSA considering your reservations about their track record with LGBT,atheists,etc. Do you think they deserve *you*? Then, if it comes down to it, sit down with your scoutmaster and make your case. Point out that pretending to believe in God would be dishonest and run directly counter to Scouting ethics and values. Finish your project. Do it for yourself, not a rank or badge. Ultimately you may not get the rank, but if you want it, fight for it.\n\nAlternatively, you could keep your mouth shut, and earn the rank, then refuse it on the grounds that the values and ethics the BSA taught you are incompatible with the BSA's treatment of gay and atheist scouts.

As I interpret it, you just need to finish what you started because, basically, your religious beliefs should have no bearing on your perceived ability to do, well, anything.  Nobody should say that you should give up in anything that you do because of something as personal as a belief structure.  You are not duty-bound to prove anything to anyone other than yourself.  The \"Can do\" attitude is a great one to have and I think if you pull anything out of this experience, it should be that.  My vote, despite not being asked for it, is that you do the best you can on your eagle project (Which I know literally nothing about).  Google your heart out, ask literally anyone else for help, and compile your project.

He claims to be Christian, but never attends church and gets furious when anyone tries to correct or dispute anything he says.\n If you part ways with the organization, doing so by being true to yourself is not demeaning.

If you were not a deeply moral and ethical person, this situation would not bother you so much. You would just lie about believing in God, figure out a way to get your Eagle project done, and then you would have what you want, which is your Eagle badge. \n\nBut this bothers you, because you don't want to lie; you know that lying is wrong; you know that it is against the Scouts code of honor to lie, and you want to achieve that honor of being an Eagle Scout without lying. Your dad has put you in what feels like an impossible situation. You can either lie to get what you want, which doesn't feel right; or you can chose to walk away and not pursue the Eagle badge, which would feel awful because you have already worked towards it and told people you are going to go for it. The situation stinks and you know it. \n\nIt sucks, having to chose between acheiving your Eagle badge and lying. You don't like either of those options. What you need is a third choice. You need to get out of the either/or conundrum.\n\n3) I am going to pause here and say some things to you that you should be hearing from the adults in your life but that you clearly are not. You are an amazing kid. I don't know if you know it or not, but you are. You are driven and internally motivated. You are a high achiever and a hard worker. You have a strong sense of ethics and you know what is right or wrong. You are passionate in your outrage because you have such a strong sense of ethics. These are all qualities that should be both supported and praised. \n\nTrust me when I tell you that most teenagers are not spending 4 to 8 hours a day on homework. You have all the attributes to succeed in this world. Keep doing what you are doing and you will find success. Don't let this situation throw you off your game. This is just a bump in the road and you will find your way past it as surely as water flows over and around all the rocks in its path. You are an unstoppable force.\n\nYour post also demonstrates some more of your sterling qualities: the fact that you can write, and write well; and the fact that you are resourceful. Your writing: your post eloquently describes your current situation and your grammar, spelling and punctuation are perfect; in fact, they are better than that of most of the adults who post on this site, so congratulate yourself on a job well-done. Your resourcefulness: your community is not being supportive of your goals, so you are reaching out to another community, Reddit, for support and help. Smart kid.\n\n4) You are also an idealist. And, as you grow and mature, you are going to suffer some bumps and bruises along the way because of your idealism. Because, as you are discovering, life is not always ideal. The way your father responded was not ideal; and the ridiculous Scout rules about believing in God are not ideal. And yet, those are the realities you now have to deal with.\n\nIt is really painful sometimes to be forced to see the world the way it is instead of how you'd like it to be. As a fellow idealist, I feel your pain.\n\n5) But the good news is that the world can be changed; and your situation can be changed.\n\n6) So what's the solution? Okay, here are some ideas. \n\na) If you really want to finish your Eagle project, do it, with or without your father's help. Find other adults in your community who can help you. Is there a teacher or a coach you have a good relationship with who can help you? If your Dad won't help you, would your Mom help you? Is there a Big Brother organization in your town that can pair you with a mentor to help you? I would also suggest using your school guidance counselor as a resource. Every school has one and he or she can help point you towards resources in your community that you might not have thought of. \n\nBy the way, it will be the ultimate fuck you to your Dad if you succeed in achieving your Eagle badge without him after he turned his back on you. I suggest you go for it.\n\nb) You are not the first person who has had problems with the restrictions of the Scouts. I know there have been many gay people who wanted, like you, to continue in the Scouts but couldn't because of the Scouts fucked-up policies. I think there are probably some more tolerant chapters of the Scouts that have formed to be more inclusive with regards to issues like homosexualty and atheism. Even if one of those chapters is not located in your geographic area, I wonder if you couldn't find one of those more inclusive chapters and complete your Eagle badge with them long-distance. Try googling 'tolerant Scout chapters' or 'atheist-friendly Scout chapters' and see what you get.\n\nc) You have a talent for writing. Use it! Use your outrage, your writing skills and your clear intelligence to get what you want, which is to get your Eagle badge without lying. How can you do this? Go public! Use the power of other people's opinions to change your situation. Look how many people here on Reddit were touched by your post and took time out of their day to respond to you! If you made your feelings known to people in your hometown, some people in your community will help you. Atheists are everywhere.\n\nI don't know a lot about the Scouts, but does the Eagle project have a writing portion to it? If it does, write an essay about this situation and how upsetting it has been to you, and then include your post and excerpts of some of the supportive comments you have received here. Let the adults in your world see how they are treating you and how it is making you feel. Your feelings are valid: share them with the world! Then send a copy of that essay to your school newspaper. Then send a copy of it to your local newspaper. Then send it as an open, public letter to the head of the Scouts organization. You clearly know how to operate on social media...use the power of social media to bring attention to your plight. The broad public support you receive will shame the adults in your community who are not supporting you.\n\nNow I hear you thinking, \"Ug, how am I going to have the time to do all that? I am already spending five hours a day doing homework.\" Yeah, I get it. I am not saying any of this will be easy. But it would be one way to get what you want; and sometimes you have to work hard in life to get what you want. But, you already know that.\n\nAlso, if you go public with your atheism in your community, you may be worried about whatever blow back you might receive. Yup, standing up for your principles is never easy, especially when you know that your principles run counter to the predominate ways of thinking in your community. Many good people throughout history have died as a result of standing up for their principles. It is not an easy thing to do. But I have faith in you, Assume_This. You can do this.\n\nYou could also just print out a copy of your post and all of the replies you have received. Give one copy to your dad. Give another copy to your mom. Then give another copy to your Scout master. And then see what happens from there.\n\nOkay? \n\nAs a mom, your story really touched a chord inside of me, which is why I am lying in bed typing this instead of getting up and doing all the things I should be doing today. Be strong, kiddo. You got what it takes to make it in this world.

Send them all a report with your achievements and that you are going for your Eagle Scout and they will send you letters, they always do. Unless your dad waltzes into your board of review I highly doubt you will run into issues. And if you do then is the time to be vocal about this issue. Bring it to as many people's attention as possible (maybe even the media) and turn this into something that will create change within the organization. (I honestly don't think that this will ever go that far though.)\n\nFinally please do not give up. Achieving the rank of Eagle is a very honorable and awesome thing to achieve. You've put too much work into it to stop now."], [7, "It sounds like you're sticking to this for no reason other than \"I've put so much work into it already, it would be a shame to stop.\"\n\nYou're exhibiting a prime example of the [Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/173/Sunk-Cost-Fallacy). It is the illogical thinking that \"If I quit now, everything I've done so far is wasted\" with little regard for the true outcome of continued investment.\n\nYou've sunk a lot of time into BSA so far in your life, that much is true. Compare your current rank/skills/achievements thus far to where you'll be when you earn Eagle rank. If you walk away right now, you walk away with all the knowledge you've gained since joining BSA. You walk away with all the life skills you've built. You walk away having learned the lesson that BSA (and many other organizations in the world) do not align with your personal beliefs, that they are discriminatory, unfair, and shortsighted. *You do not walk away with nothing*.\n\nIf you stick to it, you walk away with all those same lessons and skills and an Eagle rank. I am not familiar with BSA, so you'll need to make this decision for yourself: What more does BSA have to offer me? When you achieve Eagle rank, do they teach you a new set of secret skills? Are they going to provide you with a gleaming recommendation to a University that you wouldn't get into otherwise? On your University application, you're free to list BSA as an extra curricular that you have been with all your life. That is not nothing.\n\nYou can apply the sunk cost fallacy's logic to any situation where quitting is an option. It doesn't mean you should quit, it means that \"I've already spent so much\" isn't a logical argument.\n\nMy story:\n*In grade 11 I quit taking guitar lessons. My mom asked \"Are you sure? You've put so much work into it over the years.\" The truth was my return was diminishing. I was spending 1 hour a week in a room practicing things I could easily do on my own. I joined a community band, and played with them for a year instead. In grade 12 I quit the band. I was asked \"Are you sure? You've been with them for a whole year now and you're doing great, it would be a shame to leave after putting in so much practice.\" I didn't quit because I didn't like it, I quit because I had gained a lot from them, and there wasn't much more to take away. I was having fun, but I decided \"It's my final year of high school, I'm going to commit to my studies instead, join academic teams in school, and put in more work hours to save money.\" \n\nThose decisions helped bolster my university application. Multiple jobs, multiple extracurriculars over the years, school teams, school awards. It showed diversity, multitasking, time and priority management. All things that my university was looking for in an applicant. The jobs funded a fair portion of the school and living expenses that my parents weren't able to cover for me.\n\nMy situation was different than yours, but there are key similarities. I changed my endeavors even though I had sunk so much time and money into other ones. I maximized my gains by realizing that I don't need to be a master guitar player to achieve my other goals.*\n\nGive it a full thought: \n\nDo you need Eagle scout to achieve your goals? Are you goals even the same as they were in the past? Are there other focuses that would benefit these goals even more? I'll tell you right now, once you're accepted to University very few will care that you achieved Eagle rank, just like very few cared that I took guitar lessons and played in a band. Going into University, and then into the workforce, your success will reflect the quality of your work, not your past achievements.\n\nYour dad might be right, even if he's right for all the wrong reasons. If you go through with the Eagle project, don't do it to spite your dad, or to spite the BSA. Don't do it because you've put too much time in to quit. Do it because it's something you'll enjoy doing and it will have a significant impact on your goals."], [5, "Up until about a year ago I was an Air Cadet in the UK. We also had to make a pledge when we joined, promising to do our Duty for God, Queen and Country.\nHowever, if we were against pledging to God, we were just allowed to leave that out and it made no impact what so ever. Same thing with Church services and the like.\nAs for gay Cadets. Met loads of them.

I highly recommend it."], [4, "Thanks for sharing. I have a long story about boy scouts and Mormon, so I'll share with you:\n\nI grew up in Utah in a non-Mormon family, and here, the BSA stuff is heavily run by the Mormon Church. I would even go as far as saying that most boy scouts activities in Utah are just church activities disguised as boy scouts (at least according to my experience). My religious beliefs were mostly agnostic and they still very much are. I just... Don't really care about any of it.\n\nBecause I grew up non-Mormon, my family was pretty isolated from most of the rest of the neighborhood, though I had a couple friends throughout my childhood. But when I was around 8 or 9, I wanted to join the boy scouts in an attempt to make friends with the majority of the neighborhood kids. That and I also wanted to learn about surviving in the wild, because that has always sounded bad ass to me.\n\nNeedless to say my experience started out great. Shortly after that, I started to get bored. There was a lot of talk about God and some boy scout meetings were filled with straight-up church teachings and watching stupid ass veggie tales on the days my scout master was particularly lazy. Occasionally we did pinewood derby things, basic life skill things,a and a yearly camp out. but honesty it was mostly teachings. I didn't think much of it really at all until my scout master changed and I got a tad bit older.\n\nI consistently went for about three years maybe, working my way up to first or second class (can't remember which). I continued to be mostly bored through all the church stuff, and eventually the other kids in scouts stopped talking with me altogether. Come to find out after attempting to hang out with them outside of scouts that their parents disallowed them to hang out with me because my family wasn't Mormon. One irate mother even went as far to tell me to my face that I was a bad kid and a bad example for their kids to be around. This particularly bothered me because I didn't really get into trouble as a kid. I mostly just played video games and watched cartoons. I began to pay more attention to things, and that's when I discovered that the \"reason\" I was bad was because I didn't go to church on Sunday and neither did my family.\n\nOnce I figured that out, I started questioning the activities with my second scout master. Unfortunately, he happened the husband of the angry mom mentioned earlier so he already didn't like me much. We often got in arguments after meetings about how I needed to talk to my family about God and that I was letting them go to hell for not bringing them to church. Eventually we got into a huge blowout during a camping trip that caused me to never go back to scouts. He grabbed me by the arm and pulled me away from dinner and fucking lit into me for not praying before eating my food.\n\nThat point on, my agnostic beliefs took a touch of atheistic flavor because I had a hard time believing that there could be a God so good and powerful, yet have these people that represented him be so damn judgemental and exclusive. The scouts seemed like a sham to me, and nobody ever questioned it because everyone else was Mormon, or they quit/moved well before I figured it out. After I left, nobody ever apologized to me or reached out in any way until I was well into high school and some of the kids took the time to get to know me finally. All they did before that was send other kids to my house every week to collect \"fast-offering\" money (Mormon tithing). \n\nBasically, my opinion is that boy scouts was a complete waste of time. Obviously it means a lot more to you, as you've had a very different experience. You actually care, and you're so close to your eagle. I'd recommend speaking how you feel, but in a polite but firm manner. I don't think they can stop you from perusing your eagle despite your beliefs. My wife's family is from Wyoming (father in law is a former scout master), and their boy scouts had absolutely nothing to do with God or church at all. The eagle does mean something to some people on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (some have mentioned police and military), but in my experience, it's the equivalent of saying \"I'm Mormon\" in Utah.\n\nThat being said, you should pursue your goals 100%. If you want to stick it out, you can at least say you have experience committing to something with many difficulties and seeing it to the end, though college taught that lesson for me.\n\ntl;dr - my impression of the boy scouts where I'm from is that they're religiously corrupt and use it as a tool for teaching doctrine. I wouldn't feel bad for leaving if I were you, but I'm obviously a bit biased. Don't feel bad for expressing your beliefs, but be kinda and respectful in the manner of doing so.

Props to you for doing what I couldn't."], [4, "This boy scout thing seems important to you. It also clashes with another thing that's important to you, which is your religion (or the lack of one).\n\nI would advise you to tell them you believe in god, even if you dont, finish your Eagle thing and go on with your life.

If it bothers you that much (and it should), I think you'd be happier without them in your life."], [4, "When I had to do my final interview to get my Eagle Scout rank, the question of religion came up.  Being an atheist myself, I said that I didn't really believe in any organized religions as being the answer.  I didn't realize that believing in God was a requirement for scouting at the time.  Luckily for me, I did say that while I didn't think that any of the organized religions had it right, that it was entirely possible that there was a Supreme Being.  Apparently after I left the council debated whether or not to let me get the rank.  Because I didn't deny the existence of God, just said that I didn't think any of them had it right, they let me pass.\n\nAnyone who tells you that being an Eagle Scout is no big deal is full of shit.  A group of about 10 of my friends and I all went to the same University.  We were all in the same groups (except scouting) and had the same grades and test scores.  I got about $20K more in scholarship money than any of my friends.  The only difference was that I was an Eagle Scout.  Twenty five years later, I hire a lot of people.

One day, in the not-too-distant future, you will move out of your parents' house and then you will be able to live life on your own terms, in accordance with your own values. Do whatever you have to do to survive for now within your family and your community; but let the knowledge that one day soon you will be able to be yourself and live life on your own terms sit inside your chest like a glowing coal keeping you warm.\n\n3) The reason why this bothers you so much is because you are a deeply moral and ethical person. If you were not a deeply moral and ethical person, this situation would not bother you so much. You would just lie about believing in God, figure out a way to get your Eagle project done, and then you would have what you want, which is your Eagle badge. \n\nBut this bothers you, because you don't want to lie; you know that lying is wrong; you know that it is against the Scouts code of honor to lie, and you want to achieve that honor of being an Eagle Scout without lying. Your dad has put you in what feels like an impossible situation. You can either lie to get what you want, which doesn't feel right; or you can chose to walk away and not pursue the Eagle badge, which would feel awful because you have already worked towards it and told people you are going to go for it. The situation stinks and you know it. \n\nIt sucks, having to chose between acheiving your Eagle badge and lying. You don't like either of those options. What you need is a third choice. You need to get out of the either/or conundrum.\n\n3) I am going to pause here and say some things to you that you should be hearing from the adults in your life but that you clearly are not. You are an amazing kid. I don't know if you know it or not, but you are. You are driven and internally motivated. You are a high achiever and a hard worker. You have a strong sense of ethics and you know what is right or wrong. You are passionate in your outrage because you have such a strong sense of ethics. These are all qualities that should be both supported and praised. \n\nTrust me when I tell you that most teenagers are not spending 4 to 8 hours a day on homework. You have all the attributes to succeed in this world. Keep doing what you are doing and you will find success. Don't let this situation throw you off your game. This is just a bump in the road and you will find your way past it as surely as water flows over and around all the rocks in its path. You are an unstoppable force.\n\nYour post also demonstrates some more of your sterling qualities: the fact that you can write, and write well; and the fact that you are resourceful. Your writing: your post eloquently describes your current situation and your grammar, spelling and punctuation are perfect; in fact, they are better than that of most of the adults who post on this site, so congratulate yourself on a job well-done. Your resourcefulness: your community is not being supportive of your goals, so you are reaching out to another community, Reddit, for support and help. Smart kid.\n\n4) You are also an idealist. And, as you grow and mature, you are going to suffer some bumps and bruises along the way because of your idealism. Because, as you are discovering, life is not always ideal. The way your father responded was not ideal; and the ridiculous Scout rules about believing in God are not ideal. And yet, those are the realities you now have to deal with.\n\nIt is really painful sometimes to be forced to see the world the way it is instead of how you'd like it to be. As a fellow idealist, I feel your pain.\n\n5) But the good news is that the world can be changed; and your situation can be changed.\n\n6) So what's the solution? Okay, here are some ideas. \n\na) If you really want to finish your Eagle project, do it, with or without your father's help. Find other adults in your community who can help you. Is there a teacher or a coach you have a good relationship with who can help you? If your Dad won't help you, would your Mom help you? Is there a Big Brother organization in your town that can pair you with a mentor to help you? I would also suggest using your school guidance counselor as a resource. Every school has one and he or she can help point you towards resources in your community that you might not have thought of. \n\nBy the way, it will be the ultimate fuck you to your Dad if you succeed in achieving your Eagle badge without him after he turned his back on you. I suggest you go for it.\n\nb) You are not the first person who has had problems with the restrictions of the Scouts. I know there have been many gay people who wanted, like you, to continue in the Scouts but couldn't because of the Scouts fucked-up policies. I think there are probably some more tolerant chapters of the Scouts that have formed to be more inclusive with regards to issues like homosexualty and atheism. Even if one of those chapters is not located in your geographic area, I wonder if you couldn't find one of those more inclusive chapters and complete your Eagle badge with them long-distance. Try googling 'tolerant Scout chapters' or 'atheist-friendly Scout chapters' and see what you get.\n\nc) You have a talent for writing. Use it! Use your outrage, your writing skills and your clear intelligence to get what you want, which is to get your Eagle badge without lying. How can you do this? Go public! Use the power of other people's opinions to change your situation. Look how many people here on Reddit were touched by your post and took time out of their day to respond to you! If you made your feelings known to people in your hometown, some people in your community will help you. Atheists are everywhere.\n\nI don't know a lot about the Scouts, but does the Eagle project have a writing portion to it? If it does, write an essay about this situation and how upsetting it has been to you, and then include your post and excerpts of some of the supportive comments you have received here. Let the adults in your world see how they are treating you and how it is making you feel. Your feelings are valid: share them with the world! Then send a copy of that essay to your school newspaper. Then send a copy of it to your local newspaper. Then send it as an open, public letter to the head of the Scouts organization. You clearly know how to operate on social media...use the power of social media to bring attention to your plight. The broad public support you receive will shame the adults in your community who are not supporting you.\n\nNow I hear you thinking, \"Ug, how am I going to have the time to do all that? I am already spending five hours a day doing homework.\" Yeah, I get it. I am not saying any of this will be easy. But it would be one way to get what you want; and sometimes you have to work hard in life to get what you want. But, you already know that.\n\nAlso, if you go public with your atheism in your community, you may be worried about whatever blow back you might receive. Yup, standing up for your principles is never easy, especially when you know that your principles run counter to the predominate ways of thinking in your community. Many good people throughout history have died as a result of standing up for their principles. It is not an easy thing to do. But I have faith in you, Assume_This. You can do this.\n\nYou could also just print out a copy of your post and all of the replies you have received. Give one copy to your dad. Give another copy to your mom. Then give another copy to your Scout master. And then see what happens from there.\n\nOkay? \n\nAs a mom, your story really touched a chord inside of me, which is why I am lying in bed typing this instead of getting up and doing all the things I should be doing today. Be strong, kiddo. You got what it takes to make it in this world.

You have to sacrifice some \"personal morals\" to get what you want and give lip service to people to get what you want.  When you are older and have other people depending on you taking the \"moral high ground\" and \"standing by your beliefs\" is not so easy when you have people depending on you including family and work associates who have families.  So you can do what you have to to get that Eagle Scout and be proud of the work that you did. Do you REALLY not believe in God, because it sounds like you can \"kind of\" believe in God and get your Eagle.\n\nAs far as the rank being \"not worth much\" that is crap.  It means that even at a young age you can take on a large task and FINISH it.  it does mean something to others who have it, including people who may hire you.  It means something to people who started and never finished, they talk the most shit.  And yes, it means that you were completely involved in an organization that along with many other good things believes in God.\n\nSo do you quit now before you waste a bunch of people's time with your Eagle project or do you finish.

It is the illogical thinking that \"If I quit now, everything I've done so far is wasted\" with little regard for the true outcome of continued investment.\n\nYou've sunk a lot of time into BSA so far in your life, that much is true. Compare your current rank/skills/achievements thus far to where you'll be when you earn Eagle rank. If you walk away right now, you walk away with all the knowledge you've gained since joining BSA. You walk away with all the life skills you've built. You walk away having learned the lesson that BSA (and many other organizations in the world) do not align with your personal beliefs, that they are discriminatory, unfair, and shortsighted. *You do not walk away with nothing*.\n\nIf you stick to it, you walk away with all those same lessons and skills and an Eagle rank. I am not familiar with BSA, so you'll need to make this decision for yourself: What more does BSA have to offer me? When you achieve Eagle rank, do they teach you a new set of secret skills? Are they going to provide you with a gleaming recommendation to a University that you wouldn't get into otherwise? On your University application, you're free to list BSA as an extra curricular that you have been with all your life. That is not nothing.\n\nYou can apply the sunk cost fallacy's logic to any situation where quitting is an option. It doesn't mean you should quit, it means that \"I've already spent so much\" isn't a logical argument.\n\nMy story:\n*In grade 11 I quit taking guitar lessons. My mom asked \"Are you sure? You've put so much work into it over the years.\" The truth was my return was diminishing. I was spending 1 hour a week in a room practicing things I could easily do on my own. I joined a community band, and played with them for a year instead. In grade 12 I quit the band. I was asked \"Are you sure? You've been with them for a whole year now and you're doing great, it would be a shame to leave after putting in so much practice.\" I didn't quit because I didn't like it, I quit because I had gained a lot from them, and there wasn't much more to take away. I was having fun, but I decided \"It's my final year of high school, I'm going to commit to my studies instead, join academic teams in school, and put in more work hours to save money.\" \n\nThose decisions helped bolster my university application. Multiple jobs, multiple extracurriculars over the years, school teams, school awards. It showed diversity, multitasking, time and priority management. All things that my university was looking for in an applicant. The jobs funded a fair portion of the school and living expenses that my parents weren't able to cover for me.\n\nMy situation was different than yours, but there are key similarities. I changed my endeavors even though I had sunk so much time and money into other ones. I maximized my gains by realizing that I don't need to be a master guitar player to achieve my other goals.*\n\nGive it a full thought: \n\nDo you need Eagle scout to achieve your goals? Are you goals even the same as they were in the past? Are there other focuses that would benefit these goals even more? I'll tell you right now, once you're accepted to University very few will care that you achieved Eagle rank, just like very few cared that I took guitar lessons and played in a band. Going into University, and then into the workforce, your success will reflect the quality of your work, not your past achievements.\n\nYour dad might be right, even if he's right for all the wrong reasons. If you go through with the Eagle project, don't do it to spite your dad, or to spite the BSA. Don't do it because you've put too much time in to quit.

I have a long story about boy scouts and Mormon, so I'll share with you:\n\nI grew up in Utah in a non-Mormon family, and here, the BSA stuff is heavily run by the Mormon Church. I would even go as far as saying that most boy scouts activities in Utah are just church activities disguised as boy scouts (at least according to my experience). My religious beliefs were mostly agnostic and they still very much are. I just... Don't really care about any of it.\n\nBecause I grew up non-Mormon, my family was pretty isolated from most of the rest of the neighborhood, though I had a couple friends throughout my childhood. But when I was around 8 or 9, I wanted to join the boy scouts in an attempt to make friends with the majority of the neighborhood kids. That and I also wanted to learn about surviving in the wild, because that has always sounded bad ass to me.\n\nNeedless to say my experience started out great. Shortly after that, I started to get bored. There was a lot of talk about God and some boy scout meetings were filled with straight-up church teachings and watching stupid ass veggie tales on the days my scout master was particularly lazy. Occasionally we did pinewood derby things, basic life skill things,a and a yearly camp out. but honesty it was mostly teachings. I didn't think much of it really at all until my scout master changed and I got a tad bit older.\n\nI consistently went for about three years maybe, working my way up to first or second class (can't remember which). I continued to be mostly bored through all the church stuff, and eventually the other kids in scouts stopped talking with me altogether. Come to find out after attempting to hang out with them outside of scouts that their parents disallowed them to hang out with me because my family wasn't Mormon. One irate mother even went as far to tell me to my face that I was a bad kid and a bad example for their kids to be around. This particularly bothered me because I didn't really get into trouble as a kid. I mostly just played video games and watched cartoons. I began to pay more attention to things, and that's when I discovered that the \"reason\" I was bad was because I didn't go to church on Sunday and neither did my family.\n\nOnce I figured that out, I started questioning the activities with my second scout master. Unfortunately, he happened the husband of the angry mom mentioned earlier so he already didn't like me much. We often got in arguments after meetings about how I needed to talk to my family about God and that I was letting them go to hell for not bringing them to church. Eventually we got into a huge blowout during a camping trip that caused me to never go back to scouts. He grabbed me by the arm and pulled me away from dinner and fucking lit into me for not praying before eating my food.\n\nThat point on, my agnostic beliefs took a touch of atheistic flavor because I had a hard time believing that there could be a God so good and powerful, yet have these people that represented him be so damn judgemental and exclusive. The scouts seemed like a sham to me, and nobody ever questioned it because everyone else was Mormon, or they quit/moved well before I figured it out. After I left, nobody ever apologized to me or reached out in any way until I was well into high school and some of the kids took the time to get to know me finally. All they did before that was send other kids to my house every week to collect \"fast-offering\" money (Mormon tithing). \n\nBasically, my opinion is that boy scouts was a complete waste of time. Obviously it means a lot more to you, as you've had a very different experience. You actually care, and you're so close to your eagle. I'd recommend speaking how you feel, but in a polite but firm manner. I don't think they can stop you from perusing your eagle despite your beliefs. My wife's family is from Wyoming (father in law is a former scout master), and their boy scouts had absolutely nothing to do with God or church at all. The eagle does mean something to some people on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (some have mentioned police and military), but in my experience, it's the equivalent of saying \"I'm Mormon\" in Utah.\n\nThat being said, you should pursue your goals 100%. If you want to stick it out, you can at least say you have experience committing to something with many difficulties and seeing it to the end, though college taught that lesson for me.\n\ntl;dr - my impression of the boy scouts where I'm from is that they're religiously corrupt and use it as a tool for teaching doctrine. I wouldn't feel bad for leaving if I were you, but I'm obviously a bit biased. Don't feel bad for expressing your beliefs, but be kinda and respectful in the manner of doing so.

Often, only one or two sprinklers are required to fully extinguish a building fire.\n\nThe water in UCSD's sprinkler system pipes is constantly under pressure.

Now, although this is in the rainforest there are still a number of huts scattered throughout with small children who think it's the FUNNIEST thing to see two mzungus just running through the woods.  So naturally they all come out and run behind us shouting words at us in Swahili.\n\nAbout 5 minutes into this run and I'm deeply regretting this decision.  I slow down and let my friend run ahead....only to realize that HOLY FUCK I have no idea where I am or where this path leads.  My only two friends are these two young Kenyan girls who are still following me.  I ask them which way the mzungu went and they point me further along the path and begin skipping telling me to follow them.\n\nAt this point the immense paranoia kicks in and I think these two girls are like those twins from the shining and are going to lead me to an ambush and murder me.  So I begin sprinting along this path, so of course they run behind me trying to catch up which only continues to fuel this intense fear.  I am running my absolute ass off as I eventually make it to the clearing to my house and my friend with all the other children and I realize how incredibly stupid I'm being.  \n\nI proceed to smoke another j, watch the sunset and stare at the Kenyan stars for a few hours.

Do things look good for the company? If the answer is yes to these questions then that means the company is well managed, and just because you think they're wrong or they are being unfair, just remember that you're not in management for a reason and they are.

Got into medical school after a year of pre-med in uni, spending all that time playing football, eating out (very fussy so hall food, whilst great for 99% of people, wasn't for me) and watching TV shows and movies and hanging out with friends. Went to less than 7% of lectures (i.e. the first week of each semester, but couldn't be bothered after), esp. as i couldn't learn from them), and basically lazily studied 3-4 hours a day in the 5 days before each test, for what was in the test..for the first time. Literally was known for walking to exams and tests reading my notes as that would be the first time i'd read them.. since i started learning the content for the first time via video lecture recordings a few days before the test, and finished at say 4am the day of it)\n\nBasically lucked out that I was smart enough and lucky enough to get where I thought I wanted to be, but there's much more to that because you keep pushing the envelope...working less and less as its boring right?

I'm 25 (living in USA), dropped out of High School and never got my GED, picked up a basic office clerk job in a very small company 3 months before my 18th birthday.

I also sympathize with your feeling that relationships never work out and (from what I'm interpreting) that you're too cold for relationships. I've been single for going on 2 years now; I thought it was because I was broken and undateable, but I discovered that it's because I seek relationships to fill a void I already had within myself. I've learned that it's best to just get comfortable with yourself and being single, and if someone nice comes along and you hit it off, fantastic, but desperation and emotional dependence will only land you in a shitty dysfunctional relationship and that's much worse than being single.\n\nI guess my take-away would be not to set your expectations of yourself and your life too high. The only thing worse than not aspiring to be more is to feel like you failed when you really didn't - that will hold you back more than anything. I barely scrape by some months (and the 3D printing company set me WAY back), but career success isn't everything in life. Just have fun, spend enough time each day doing what **you** want to do - develop a creative talent, make lots of friends, marathon that TV show you were interested in, get addicted to a videogame. The only thing worse than feeling like you failed in your career is feeling like you didn't spend enough time enjoying the small things in life because you were working too hard. Spend time with yourself, figure out who you are and learn to love yourself. You will find happiness, I promise you that. And with that inner happiness and peace, everything else - love, success, friends - will all come into place on their own. And if they don't, who cares?

Went to less than 7% of lectures (i.e. the first week of each semester, but couldn't be bothered after), esp. as i couldn't learn from them), and basically lazily studied 3-4 hours a day in the 5 days before each test, for what was in the test..for the first time.

I'm 25 (living in USA), dropped out of High School and never got my GED, picked up a basic office clerk job in a very small company 3 months before my 18th birthday. Worked there for 6 years, acquired an impressive resume, moved on to a small 3D printing company/manufacturer of which I was lined up to be a partner (company ultimately crashed and burned), and now I'm an Administrative Assistant for the Inc 500's #55 fastest growing company in the US.\n\nStill no GED, no college, still play video games and watch anime every damn day. I also sympathize with your feeling that relationships never work out and (from what I'm interpreting) that you're too cold for relationships. I've been single for going on 2 years now; I thought it was because I was broken and undateable, but I discovered that it's because I seek relationships to fill a void I already had within myself. I've learned that it's best to just get comfortable with yourself and being single, and if someone nice comes along and you hit it off, fantastic, but desperation and emotional dependence will only land you in a shitty dysfunctional relationship and that's much worse than being single.\n\nI guess my take-away would be not to set your expectations of yourself and your life too high. The only thing worse than not aspiring to be more is to feel like you failed when you really didn't - that will hold you back more than anything. I barely scrape by some months (and the 3D printing company set me WAY back), but career success isn't everything in life. Just have fun, spend enough time each day doing what **you** want to do - develop a creative talent, make lots of friends, marathon that TV show you were interested in, get addicted to a videogame. The only thing worse than feeling like you failed in your career is feeling like you didn't spend enough time enjoying the small things in life because you were working too hard.

It all generally curves downward, but there is essentially a T intersection in the back. One way goes to the nose, the other way goes to your stomach (or lungs if you're inhaling). \n\nNow most penises are curved, and most penises curve upwards. So if he's laying flat on his back, and you're blowing him from between his legs, his penis is already pointing towards your nasal passage when it's in the back of your throat. Whereas if you're in the 69 position, it's pointing towards your esophagus. Of course, this can change depending on how curved it is.\n\nSo this would be my first recommendation for avoiding jizz out the nose.

Op's dick was the stage for l1 and l2's Beyonc\u00e9 vs shakira tongue dance off.\nOp finally took control and pulled l1 up and then turned him over, he was ready to plow like old McDonald on his farm and make this little piggy go \"ee! Ay!! Eee! ayyy! OH!!\"  \nL2 wasn't about to be left out though so he came around front for l1 to blow him while he made out with op. It was a weird sight for op but strangely it turned him on even more as picked up speed and started fucking l1 even harder. L2 new op was ready to bust so he went around back and started rimming op. Op could feel something swirling around his asshole and every so often poking in but he liked it. It was like ballet at the butthole and he was ready to give the crowd a huge climax. He didn't know if it was ok or not to cum inside l1 but he didn't care. He was paying for it so why settle for a toaster strudel when you can make a twinkie?\nHe began to pound so hard he could feel the ripples on l1's ass making waves. He tried to hold back a bit more but l1 starting squeezing his asshole with every pull back of op's dick and relaxing on the way back in. Op shot his load deep inside l1 and was finally spent. He rolled over and mumbled how great it was but to his dismay...without the hormones and booze adjusting his vision...well now he could see the completely obvious features of a man on his two guests....he was ready to pay and run away...
