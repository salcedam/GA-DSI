The failure of the original Articles of Confederation was attributed to a weak federal government without sufficient power to tax. Following are some high points of the development of a strong federal government and the subordination of states rights. The link is to the articles of Confederation and explains their failure.\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation\n\nThe Kentucky and Virginia resolutions of 1798 and 1799,\nThe resolutions argued that the states had the right and the duty to declare unconstitutional acts of Congress that were not authorized by the Constitution. In doing so, they argued for states' rights and strict constructionism of the Constitution. The states lost.\n\nThe Missouri Compromise, \"regulated slavery in the country's western territories by prohibiting the practice in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north, except within the boundaries of the proposed state of Missouri.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise\n\nThe Federal Tarriff scheme that subsidized northern rail and port development and was collected off of southern agricultural production, \"As early as the Revolutionary War, the South primarily produced cotton, rice, sugar, indigo and tobacco. The North purchased these raw materials and turned them into manufactured goods. By 1828, foreign manufactured goods faced high import taxes. Foreign raw materials, however, were free of tariffs.\n\nThus the domestic manufacturing industries of the North benefited twice, once as the producers enjoying the protection of high manufacturing tariffs and once as consumers with a free raw materials market. The raw materials industries of the South were left to struggle against foreign competition.\n\nBecause manufactured goods were not produced in the South, they had to either be imported or shipped down from the North. Either way, a large expense, be it shipping fees or the federal tariff, was added to the price of manufactured goods only for Southerners. Because importation was often cheaper than shipping from the North, the South paid most of the federal tariffs.\n\nMuch of the tariff revenue collected from Southern consumers was used to build railroads and canals in the North. Between 1830 and 1850, 30,000 miles of track was laid. At its best, these tracks benefited the North. Much of it had no economic effect at all. Many of the schemes to lay track were simply a way to get government subsidies. Fraud and corruption were rampant.\n\nWith most of the tariff revenue collected in the South and then spent in the North, the South rightly felt exploited. At the time, 90% of the federal government's annual revenue came from these taxes on imports.\"\nhttp://www.emarotta.com/protective-tariffs-the-primary-cause-of-the-civil-war/\n\nSo Lincoln was elected after 80 years of strengthening of a federal power as head of a party that was formed based on its abolition to slavery and funded by a tarriff system that was a burden on the south. \nHe did not make abolition an issue until he could use it to damage the South economically because the war was all about maintaining the Union. After the Abolition Proclamation many Union soldiers left the field as they had not fought to free the slaves but to preserve the Union. \nYou have to understand a slave as a store of value and an economic production unit to understand that freeing the slaves was akin to the communists seizing the factories of the lands they conquered. Slaves were the southern engines of production.\n In summary Linoln was personally opposed to slavery and the Republican Party was founded in part in opposition to slavery but the Civil War would surely have had a far different outcome if it was presented as a struggle to end slavery."], [2, "I study history and one of my courses was on America.

He said if he could save the union by freeing the slaves, he would. If he could do it by freeing not even a single slave, he would. If he could do it by freeing some and keeping others enslaved, he would. This last one was actually his tactic, as many have pointed out. Even as the civil war was wrapping  up he was ambiguous about the fate of slavery afterwards. He played to the political currents, and even actually held off on issuing the emancipation proclamation. He waited until the political climate was more in his favor. He was -not- an abolitionist, and many actual abolitionists were unhappy with him. Thus he was losing support from Northern democrats and black republicans. He issued the emancipation proclamation as a morale boost to his supporters, to demoralize the south, and to add black soldiers to their numbers. He saw that there were more advantages to using them than keeping them sidelined. AFTER the proclamation he became more vocal about ending slavery and saying that any black person who would spill blood for the union had the right to be a full citizen, but he still actually held off on making that a reality."], [1, "Few forget that during the war, many union states had slaves and Lincoln did not emancipate them until after the war.

Abe Lincoln made many suggestions that he did not want to abolish slavery, he just wanted to keep the Union together. Abolitionists had gotten deep into politics by the time war broke out.

The failure of the original Articles of Confederation was attributed to a weak federal government without sufficient power to tax. Following are some high points of the development of a strong federal government and the subordination of states rights. The link is to the articles of Confederation and explains their failure.\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation\n\nThe Kentucky and Virginia resolutions of 1798 and 1799,\nThe resolutions argued that the states had the right and the duty to declare unconstitutional acts of Congress that were not authorized by the Constitution. In doing so, they argued for states' rights and strict constructionism of the Constitution. The states lost.\n\nThe Missouri Compromise, \"regulated slavery in the country's western territories by prohibiting the practice in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north, except within the boundaries of the proposed state of Missouri.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise\n\nThe Federal Tarriff scheme that subsidized northern rail and port development and was collected off of southern agricultural production, \"As early as the Revolutionary War, the South primarily produced cotton, rice, sugar, indigo and tobacco. The North purchased these raw materials and turned them into manufactured goods. By 1828, foreign manufactured goods faced high import taxes. Foreign raw materials, however, were free of tariffs.\n\nThus the domestic manufacturing industries of the North benefited twice, once as the producers enjoying the protection of high manufacturing tariffs and once as consumers with a free raw materials market. The raw materials industries of the South were left to struggle against foreign competition.\n\nBecause manufactured goods were not produced in the South, they had to either be imported or shipped down from the North. Either way, a large expense, be it shipping fees or the federal tariff, was added to the price of manufactured goods only for Southerners. Because importation was often cheaper than shipping from the North, the South paid most of the federal tariffs.\n\nMuch of the tariff revenue collected from Southern consumers was used to build railroads and canals in the North. Between 1830 and 1850, 30,000 miles of track was laid. At its best, these tracks benefited the North. Much of it had no economic effect at all. Many of the schemes to lay track were simply a way to get government subsidies. Fraud and corruption were rampant.\n\nWith most of the tariff revenue collected in the South and then spent in the North, the South rightly felt exploited. At the time, 90% of the federal government's annual revenue came from these taxes on imports.\"\nhttp://www.emarotta.com/protective-tariffs-the-primary-cause-of-the-civil-war/\n\nSo Lincoln was elected after 80 years of strengthening of a federal power as head of a party that was formed based on its abolition to slavery and funded by a tarriff system that was a burden on the south. \nHe did not make abolition an issue until he could use it to damage the South economically because the war was all about maintaining the Union. After the Abolition Proclamation many Union soldiers left the field as they had not fought to free the slaves but to preserve the Union. \nYou have to understand a slave as a store of value and an economic production unit to understand that freeing the slaves was akin to the communists seizing the factories of the lands they conquered. Slaves were the southern engines of production.\n In summary Linoln was personally opposed to slavery and the Republican Party was founded in part in opposition to slavery but the Civil War would surely have had a far different outcome if it was presented as a struggle to end slavery.", "id": "cz1eqjm"}], [{"comment": "I study history and one of my courses was on America.

He waited until the political climate was more in his favor. He was -not- an abolitionist, and many actual abolitionists were unhappy with him. Thus he was losing support from Northern democrats and black republicans. He issued the emancipation proclamation as a morale boost to his supporters, to demoralize the south, and to add black soldiers to their numbers.

The former slaves were struck by smallpox and starvation, and survivors had to be rescued.\nMr Lincoln also considered sending freed slaves to what is now Panama, to construct a canal \u2014 decades before work began on the modern canal there in 1904.\nThe colonisation plan collapsed by 1864. The British were fearful the confederate states of the American south may win the civil war, reverse emancipation, and regard British agents as thieves. Congress also voted to remove funding.\nYet as late as that autumn, a letter sent to the president by his attorney-general showed he was still actively exploring whether the policy could be implemented, Mr Page said.\n\u201cIt says \u2018further to your question, yes, I think you can still pursue this policy of colonisation even though the money has been taken away\u2019,\u201d he said.\nMr Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865.\n\n\nAnd about the reason for war. Like I said, slavery had deep roots in it. What was happening was that the U.S Government was split between Slave states and Free states. This is how they balanced power. When more states began to join the Union the South feared that they would loose power because more states would become Free states and voting processes would favor Free state regulations. Because of this the South wanted to leave fearing that they would be overwhelmed by Free states and harsher regulations would be passed on them.

There is no firm consensus on beach nudity even today across so-called Western cultures (although the trend is to cover up).  I can recall stories of medieval folk who hadn't been naked for years, and knights who tried to keep their daughters from changing clothes in the hall.  Victorians are often thought of as prudes, but you can find artwork which displays fashions which involved corsets that pushed women's breasts out of the top of dresses (that might be older than Victorian now that I think of it).  Woodstock hippies had different attitudes towards nudity than World War 2 veterans in the 20th century.  Length of skirts in fashion has often been correlated with the stock market.\n\nA lot of this is practical and doesn't necessarily reflect an attitude towards nudity.

In ancient pagan cults there were situations when public nudity was OK, for example at festivals like Roman Saturnalia or Greek Bachanalia and I think Celts also had a festival like that, but I'm not sure. The reason was probably that they worshiped gods who were close to nature and liked all kinds of earthly pleasures...  Prophets of monotheist religions, however, denied this attitude as they emphasized the importance of the soul and said that the needs of the body distracts you from nurturing and purifying your soul and getting closer to God... In the middle ages it even went further as the body became the symbol of temptation and the agent of the devil. Many of the Catholic Saints for example tried to deny bodily needs (didn't care about their personal hygiene, stopped eating for a long time, etc) and even tortured themselves with whips or other things in order to get closer to God. Those who tried to maintain pagan cults and tried to organize any festivals like the ones before were punished. Later it also became a common part of testimonies at witch trials: many of them claim that the \"witch\" danced around a campfire with other people naked before making a pact with the devil.

There is no firm consensus on beach nudity even today across so-called Western cultures (although the trend is to cover up).  I can recall stories of medieval folk who hadn't been naked for years, and knights who tried to keep their daughters from changing clothes in the hall.  Victorians are often thought of as prudes, but you can find artwork which displays fashions which involved corsets that pushed women's breasts out of the top of dresses (that might be older than Victorian now that I think of it).  Woodstock hippies had different attitudes towards nudity than World War 2 veterans in the 20th century.  Length of skirts in fashion has often been correlated with the stock market.\n\nA lot of this is practical and doesn't necessarily reflect an attitude towards nudity.

In ancient pagan cults there were situations when public nudity was OK, for example at festivals like Roman Saturnalia or Greek Bachanalia and I think Celts also had a festival like that, but I'm not sure. The reason was probably that they worshiped gods who were close to nature and liked all kinds of earthly pleasures...  Prophets of monotheist religions, however, denied this attitude as they emphasized the importance of the soul and said that the needs of the body distracts you from nurturing and purifying your soul and getting closer to God... In the middle ages it even went further as the body became the symbol of temptation and the agent of the devil. Many of the Catholic Saints for example tried to deny bodily needs (didn't care about their personal hygiene, stopped eating for a long time, etc) and even tortured themselves with whips or other things in order to get closer to God. Those who tried to maintain pagan cults and tried to organize any festivals like the ones before were punished. Later it also became a common part of testimonies at witch trials: many of them claim that the \"witch\" danced around a campfire with other people naked before making a pact with the devil.

Check it out."], [44, "Now, I'll try to answer from my country's perspective (not a US country or a western European one)\n\nFirst of all, soldiers of my nation fought under Austro-Hungarian empire back then and, well, they lost, basically. Soon after our nation got into the Kingdom of SCS (Serbs, Croats and Slovenes), with it's capital in Belgrade. The problem here was that the Serbs were on the winning side of war and didn't really pay much attention to the So\u010da (Isonzo) Front that went on on our nation's territory and there weren't a lot of monuments erected, besides the one that were made during the war itself. Not only that, but South Slavic nations didn't really get along with Germans, which held most positions in power during Austro-Hungarian empire, very well. It was best to hush the whole thing and just point out the most \u02ddheroic\u02dd events of the war (assasination of heir Franz Ferdinand for example).\n\nFast forward 40 years later. The events of WWI were completely overshadowed by the events of WWII. It changed the regime of the country, now called Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (it had some other names aswell, before this one, but let's not get in too much details right now). Now the government in this country felt that building monuments for partisans and victims of nazi terror and educating students on the partisan movement in Yugoslavia was a primary goal when teaching about history. The WWI slowly drifted at the backs of the people's minds.\n\nBut they didn't forgot it. Just before we got our own country, Kobarid/Karfeit/Caporetto museum (place, near where the breakthrough if So\u010da\u00b4s front went on, hence the even was called The Miracle at Kobarid/Karfeit/Caporetto) was built and financed, solely focused on the WWI and the life at the front. Still, WWI was something worth discussing just by the people who lived, where the  front took place (and where I myself live).\n\nStill, now when there is 100th anniversary of the events during the war, Italy and Slovenia financed events and gatherings, some monuments etc. to commemorate people who died and lived through that horrid set of years."], [42, "[removed]"], [28, "I work in London for a major armed forces charity and we've had all kinds of campaigns to acknowledge the centenary, in particular the Battle of the Somme.  \nIf you're interested in Commonwealth-based remembrance, there's a site called Every Man Remembered which is an archive of all the soldiers and the ability to commemorate them individually.  \nhttp://www.everymanremembered.org/"], [81, "I fear that it is being overlooked because the First World War is misunderstood.  Many still view it as a largely inconclusive, futile and costly event in history which doesn't seem to have as clear a dividing line as does the Second World War.\n\nIn actuality, it was anything but, it was such a world changing event in so many ways that modern historians sometimes ascribe to what is called the \"Late Twentieth Century.\" What this means is that the Twentieth Century begins not as it should by linear time (Jan 1 1901) but begins due to the revolutionary geo-political, industrial and human developments occurring in its first two decades and thus properly begins at some point either shortly after November 11 1918 or with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in July 1919, depending on which historian you ask and how fine they want to split hairs.\n\nThere are many websites, new org's and event co-ordinators working on various projects reflecting all sorts of aspects of WWI, but you'd really have to have a vested interest in the subject matter to seek them out. One thing I'm enthusiastic about and as some have blithely pointed out in other comments, is the release of BF1.  I'm optimistic that the gaming community who play this title will be inspired to want to learn more about this conflict.\n\nWhat I'm more concerned about is not quite, as OP describes it the lack of attention being paid now, it is that it comes in fits and starts- in August two years ago with the centenary of the onset of war; last summer for our Australian and New Zealand friends marking the anniversary of Gallipoli, this pass summer of \"Somme100\" and upcoming with Canada in April of 2017, a centenary since Vimy Ridge; ending of course with a very somber anniversary in November of 1918.

Now the government in this country felt that building monuments for partisans and victims of nazi terror and educating students on the partisan movement in Yugoslavia was a primary goal when teaching about history. The WWI slowly drifted at the backs of the people's minds.\n\nBut they didn't forgot it. Just before we got our own country, Kobarid/Karfeit/Caporetto museum (place, near where the breakthrough if So\u010da\u00b4s front went on, hence the even was called The Miracle at Kobarid/Karfeit/Caporetto) was built and financed, solely focused on the WWI and the life at the front. Still, WWI was something worth discussing just by the people who lived, where the  front took place (and where I myself live).\n\nStill, now when there is 100th anniversary of the events during the war, Italy and Slovenia financed events and gatherings, some monuments etc. to commemorate people who died and lived through that horrid set of years.", "id": "d9e7cuu"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d9e7a33"}], [{"comment": "I work in London for a major armed forces charity and we've had all kinds of campaigns to acknowledge the centenary, in particular the Battle of the Somme.  \nIf you're interested in Commonwealth-based remembrance, there's a site called Every Man Remembered which is an archive of all the soldiers and the ability to commemorate them individually.  \nhttp://www.everymanremembered.org/", "id": "d9e6dvq"}, {"comment": "WW1 is heavily remembered here. \n\nMaybe its just an American thing that there isn't much discussion?", "id": "d9e8flq"}, {"comment": "Well, considering the war never happened in North America, and we don't have physical things to remind us of it (like the actual trenches or random buried ordnance), I can understand why people in the USA don't care as much.

Under more realistic conditions, you would often be fortunate simply to bomb the correct district, or even the right city.\n\nThe concept of bombing cities was not new. During the 1930s, bombers were the 'nuke' of the day; for some time, the simple fact of the state of the technology was that a bomber could fly higher and faster than an interceptor; that they could not be intercepted, that \"the bomber will always get through\", and it was theorised that a war might even be fought entirely from the air, with bombers skipping over armies and defenses to drop cataclysmic amounts of explosive on cities and industry, striking directly at a nation's heart.\n\nIn practice, it didn't work quite like that. Fighter technology advanced, and when war came, the bombers took serious losses. \n\nDuring the battle for France, attempts were made to attack Nazi industry; due to the state of the technology, as mentioned, worse at the time, they were fortunate to simply hit the right cities, never mind the specific factories and facilities they were aiming for.\n\nDifferent tactics were used. \n\nThe Americans persisted in attempts to strike specific facilities, launching attacks during the day, escorted by fighter aircraft.\n\n[You'll no doubt be familiar with the visuals of this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA6GYXDyxj8)\n\nThey suffered extensive losses, and the strategy was reflected in the aircraft used, which bristled with defensive armament.\n\nBritish bombing, on the other hand, was done at night, with a different target. The Americans went after the factories; the British pursued the workers. Their intention was that by destroying the homes of Nazi German civilians, their morale would be compromised, they would not be able to work efficiently, and the logistical difficulties of feeding and housing them would place strain on their government.\n\nAnd if many of them died in the process, well, I doubt that was much of a concern.\n\n>The destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale, and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battle fronts by fear of extended and intensified bombing, are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy. They are not by-products of attempts to hit factories.\n\nThe Germans, on the other hand, had their famous 'blitz'. It didn't work very well for a number of reasons, and didn't have especially great effect beyond hardening Britain's resolve.\n\nDo not assume that the failure of the Nazis to flatten British cities and slaughter their occupants wholesale reflects any moral superiority; the incompetence of the Luftwaffe and Nazi industry in general prevented them from having any useful quantity of heavy bombers, but they would have used them if they had them.\n\nWhere they *did* have the opportunity to bomb with impunity, they cheerfully bombed the shit out of all sorts of places; Madrid, Guernica, Rotterdam, and Warsaw, just to name a few, were gravely damaged by the Luftwaffe's attacks. \n\nThe Nazis were quite proficient at murdering people who could not defend themselves.\n\nIn Japan, matters were different.\n\nJapanese industry was quite decentralised; small workshops and 'cottage industry' were responsible for a great deal of production.\n\nThe usual US approach simply would not work; what, essentially, is the difference between launching precision raids on half a city and simply flying over and plastering the whole place?\n\nThe mostly-wood construction of Tokyo in particular made it especially vulnerable; while it was not actually nuked, it was rather hard to recognise the difference.\n\nThe Japanese government and people were... resistant to the notion of 'surrender'. If memory serves, there were large riots when the announcement was made.\n\nTo bomb a city indiscriminately is a morally grey thing at best, but under the circumstances, with tens of thousands dying every day, and the absolutely atrocious conduct of the Nazi German and Imperial Japanese governments and troops, I'm inclined to consider it justified.", "id": "d8zurva"}, {"comment": "I agree whole heartedly with you.

Indigenous Australian here. To answer your question briefly, basically everyone is right in saying that Indigenous people adapted to the land, and that didn't really leave much room for permanent development (i.e buildings/farming). On my country, it can get to nearly 50 degrees celsius during the summer, and during winter it will usually sit at around 2 degrees by 10 or 11am in the morning. People needed to move around, because Australia is fucking insane. \nBut, Indigenous people developed an EXTREMELY detailed knowledge of how their land worked and how to best work that to their advantage. Very clever and often ingenious ways of hunting, gathering, storing and/or preserving food. For example, Indigenous people are known to be responsible for large changes in the Australian ecosystem by manipulating it to suit their needs. \nSome paintings of early colonial Australia show landscapes that look vastly different to what they do today - forests now existing where there were once meadows and plains. Koori people would create traps by continually flattening certain areas of land to create clearings what would make group hunting easier. Even though they did not use their time building things, they certainly didn't waste it twiddling their thumbs. \nBesides those basics, they developed languages, dance, art, and music. Each mob in Australia has it's own system of law, some of it similar and some vastly different, usually depending on geographical location. There are also common languages that most clusters of groups developed and were proficient in. \nLets not forget that ALL of this knowledge was for 40-60,000 years passed down solely by word of mouth, and while much of the knowledge has been lost, there are still so much wisdom available through our elders. Only really in the last 20-30 years have Indigenous people (not white people writing it for them) began to write down their own knowledge. \n\nBasically the only real issue for English settlers when they arrived is that koori's didn't live in buildings or 'cultivate' the land by their definition. Those are both the staples for them recognising \"civilisation\".\nGreat question tho, its always nice to see someone interested in Indigenous Australians :)\n\nEDIT: I think I should replace my use of \"nomadic\" with \"seasonal\" as another redditor pointed out. Indigenous mobs have defined territories, that family groups and smaller tribes of the same nation would move around to usually the same spots depending on the season. \nAlso, god damn all the answers in this thread are awesome.

It's the same reason why many other nomads never settled down, there was no need; a nomadic lifestyle is more suited to the evironment. \nThe inital British colonies were stunted by these factors, but the use of sophisticated and modern technology, (fertilisers and steam power) meant the land could be colonised by Eurasian style agriculture. The aboriginals did have a culturally rich societies with a strong oral tradition, but the scarcity of resources made moving beyond family tribes (of a few hundred people) impossible. Thus they never evolved into larger groups, based in cities; which we might denote as a 'Western civilisation'. \nI hope I have answered your question.\nEdit: The idea of civilisation is not inherently better than hunter-gather societies or small static ones. It's simply an alternative method of surviving. The aboriginals were just fine, they had an unbelievably intricate understanding of their environment and in the more fertile parts, they had small static settlements. They were thriving, with estimates of around a million people before European arrival. Their isolation from the rest of the world probably contributed to the lack of a 'western civilisation'.

It's a truism that if you do not have the materials to build something you cannot build that thing. If you look at the terrain, climate and types of resources available in australia you'll see that those europeans took for granted are either inaccessible at the populations current technical level, too scarce to allow for mass exploitation or simply not present. \n\nSecond: Need.

It was short and difficult, and, particularly in Qld and NSW, it was founded on an act of environmental vandalism second only to the Sahara desertification. Plus the slaughter and extinction of the entire continuum of macro fauna. The lack of domesticated food animals and cultivated vegetables or grains meant that famine was a regular occurrence, and in those areas where food was abundant, mobs warred constantly.

Of course indigenous Australians had communities, complex systems of organization and governance etc. This question is based on the assumption that human culture always must evolve towards societies that resemble Western culture and are based on high concentrations of people supported by large scale agriculture. Some places do that, some don't, it is not a mark off progress or cultural complexity. Also, as others have noted, first European interactions with many other groups of people were poorly comprehended and recorded as everything was screened through a comparative and colonial lens. There are also real economic and political reasons governments label people nomadic so I would be very careful before using that term as very very few groups in the world have historically met that definitions. (Most groups being called nomadic move seasonally but have distinct seasonally communities and territories). The logic behind this being, if you have no home because you're nomadic then you have no right to the land we are stealing from you.

Indigenous Australian here. To answer your question briefly, basically everyone is right in saying that Indigenous people adapted to the land, and that didn't really leave much room for permanent development (i.e buildings/farming). On my country, it can get to nearly 50 degrees celsius during the summer, and during winter it will usually sit at around 2 degrees by 10 or 11am in the morning. People needed to move around, because Australia is fucking insane. \nBut, Indigenous people developed an EXTREMELY detailed knowledge of how their land worked and how to best work that to their advantage. Very clever and often ingenious ways of hunting, gathering, storing and/or preserving food. For example, Indigenous people are known to be responsible for large changes in the Australian ecosystem by manipulating it to suit their needs. \nSome paintings of early colonial Australia show landscapes that look vastly different to what they do today - forests now existing where there were once meadows and plains. Koori people would create traps by continually flattening certain areas of land to create clearings what would make group hunting easier. Even though they did not use their time building things, they certainly didn't waste it twiddling their thumbs. \nBesides those basics, they developed languages, dance, art, and music. Each mob in Australia has it's own system of law, some of it similar and some vastly different, usually depending on geographical location. There are also common languages that most clusters of groups developed and were proficient in. \nLets not forget that ALL of this knowledge was for 40-60,000 years passed down solely by word of mouth, and while much of the knowledge has been lost, there are still so much wisdom available through our elders. Only really in the last 20-30 years have Indigenous people (not white people writing it for them) began to write down their own knowledge. \n\nBasically the only real issue for English settlers when they arrived is that koori's didn't live in buildings or 'cultivate' the land by their definition. Those are both the staples for them recognising \"civilisation\".\nGreat question tho, its always nice to see someone interested in Indigenous Australians :)\n\nEDIT: I think I should replace my use of \"nomadic\" with \"seasonal\" as another redditor pointed out. Indigenous mobs have defined territories, that family groups and smaller tribes of the same nation would move around to usually the same spots depending on the season. \nAlso, god damn all the answers in this thread are awesome.

Most people take the standards of the Eora nations, which lived around modern day Sydney, as a mould for all Indigenous people. Around Sydney isn't too extreme, and pretty lush so the people wouldn't have needed buildings to survive with, even when they moved nomadically because the climate of the east coast doesn't really change until you hit much further north.

The aboriginals did have a culturally rich societies with a strong oral tradition, but the scarcity of resources made moving beyond family tribes (of a few hundred people) impossible. Thus they never evolved into larger groups, based in cities; which we might denote as a 'Western civilisation'. \nI hope I have answered your question.\nEdit: The idea of civilisation is not inherently better than hunter-gather societies or small static ones. It's simply an alternative method of surviving. The aboriginals were just fine, they had an unbelievably intricate understanding of their environment and in the more fertile parts, they had small static settlements. They were thriving, with estimates of around a million people before European arrival. Their isolation from the rest of the world probably contributed to the lack of a 'western civilisation'.

Do you mean cultures that have major cities? Of course indigenous Australians had communities, complex systems of organization and governance etc. This question is based on the assumption that human culture always must evolve towards societies that resemble Western culture and are based on high concentrations of people supported by large scale agriculture. Some places do that, some don't, it is not a mark off progress or cultural complexity. Also, as others have noted, first European interactions with many other groups of people were poorly comprehended and recorded as everything was screened through a comparative and colonial lens. There are also real economic and political reasons governments label people nomadic so I would be very careful before using that term as very very few groups in the world have historically met that definitions. (Most groups being called nomadic move seasonally but have distinct seasonally communities and territories). The logic behind this being, if you have no home because you're nomadic then you have no right to the land we are stealing from you.  Same goes for there being very few agriculturalists is the southwest US. Of course people were farming! But if I say that you weren't, then all of a sudden I can take your water right away because you don't need them. This stuff is still having real impacts on people's lives today.

Could the various ethnic groups, nations, clans, chiefdoms, or kingdoms have united at this point to drive the Europeans out? (the word \"tribe\" is considered a no-no when speaking of sub-Saharan African peoples.) Remember, the Zulu impi under Cetshwayo had defeated the British encamped forces at Isandlwana just five years previously - but, no. By 1884 it was too late. Machine guns, artillery, repeating rifles, and advancing military techniques made the European forces too powerful to overcome. Especially in a land so rich with gold, diamonds, ivory, and rubber.  \n\nPlease forgive my brevity, but there are enormous tomes written about any of the things I just mentioned and those barely scratch the surface.

Sure they fielded armies of thousands, control hundreds of thousands of square miles of territory, had armies that lived entirely on the move, traveled at unheard of speeds for the day (50mi/day), and assaulted through terrain that the the British thought was unpassable. And after some initial victories were crushed utterly by the technologically and numerically superior forces brought in from around the world, places the Zulus could never hope to effect. \n\nFurthermore the Zulu army could not operate outside the terrain of southern Africa if they wanted to. The relied on herding their cattle along with the army for food. Those cattle could not be herded through the jungles and deserts of large parts of Africa. They had no other logistic train. This is a major flaw in your entire premise. No African forces had the logistics to operate in varied terrain and to supply troops across Africa's numerous climate zones.\n\nThe forces that could do that: European ones relied on modern technology; canning, trucks, and organizational skills that were not available to African tribesmen. Organizational skills the ability to coordinate thousands of people across half a planet all dedicate to a single goal is technology. And technology the Africans did not and would not develop. It took the Europeans hundreds of years of nation building to develop them. \n\nHow the African tribes have united? It took Germany and Italy until the late 1800s to do so and they are much more homogeneous regions than Africa. The Zulu have nothing in common with the Ethiopians or the Yoruba. Complete lack of infrastructure, even awareness of each other existence made any sort of unified front impossible. \n\nYes the Africans could win individual battles, and the Europeans could decide the territory was not worth it. But when you are facing a country that has the attitude to let the Highland Scots or the Indians kill and be killed be the Africans because its a win win all around for the English its very hard to make that cost too high. \nAnd as we see in the Zulu War the fact that the Zulu won a few battles made it a point of honor to the British not to lose the war and to go all out. This is no Vietnam scenario with the public opposed to the war. This is a war where the white man must prove his superiority over the black native and revenge his fallen brothers.

Raw materials, precious minerals, slaves, and Ivory passed through these ports. \nHowever, you are most likely referring to the colonization known widely as the \"Scramble for Africa,\" which began in 1884 with the European powers essentially carving up huge territories for themselves, with little to no thought of how the division would affect those already living there (which plays a large roll in why Africa still struggles today, among other things). Could the various ethnic groups, nations, clans, chiefdoms, or kingdoms have united at this point to drive the Europeans out? (the word \"tribe\" is considered a no-no when speaking of sub-Saharan African peoples.) Remember, the Zulu impi under Cetshwayo had defeated the British encamped forces at Isandlwana just five years previously - but, no. By 1884 it was too late. Machine guns, artillery, repeating rifles, and advancing military techniques made the European forces too powerful to overcome. Especially in a land so rich with gold, diamonds, ivory, and rubber.  \n\nPlease forgive my brevity, but there are enormous tomes written about any of the things I just mentioned and those barely scratch the surface. But this is what I could bang out at work in between doing what I get paid for. Feel free to ask if you have any questions, as I would love to go more in depth into anything you'd like to know.

The largest most powerful African states, states like the Zulu nation at the end of the 1800s failed to hold off the Europeans at all. Sure they fielded armies of thousands, control hundreds of thousands of square miles of territory, had armies that lived entirely on the move, traveled at unheard of speeds for the day (50mi/day), and assaulted through terrain that the the British thought was unpassable. And after some initial victories were crushed utterly by the technologically and numerically superior forces brought in from around the world, places the Zulus could never hope to effect. \n\nFurthermore the Zulu army could not operate outside the terrain of southern Africa if they wanted to. The relied on herding their cattle along with the army for food. Those cattle could not be herded through the jungles and deserts of large parts of Africa. They had no other logistic train. This is a major flaw in your entire premise. No African forces had the logistics to operate in varied terrain and to supply troops across Africa's numerous climate zones.\n\nThe forces that could do that: European ones relied on modern technology; canning, trucks, and organizational skills that were not available to African tribesmen. Organizational skills the ability to coordinate thousands of people across half a planet all dedicate to a single goal is technology. And technology the Africans did not and would not develop. It took the Europeans hundreds of years of nation building to develop them. \n\nHow the African tribes have united? It took Germany and Italy until the late 1800s to do so and they are much more homogeneous regions than Africa. The Zulu have nothing in common with the Ethiopians or the Yoruba. Complete lack of infrastructure, even awareness of each other existence made any sort of unified front impossible. \n\nYes the Africans could win individual battles, and the Europeans could decide the territory was not worth it. But when you are facing a country that has the attitude to let the Highland Scots or the Indians kill and be killed be the Africans because its a win win all around for the English its very hard to make that cost too high. \nAnd as we see in the Zulu War the fact that the Zulu won a few battles made it a point of honor to the British not to lose the war and to go all out. This is no Vietnam scenario with the public opposed to the war. This is a war where the white man must prove his superiority over the black native and revenge his fallen brothers. Its a different time and place than Vietnam.\n\nEven the forces in Africa with European technology failed.

The bible is a collection of writings from believers and saved and curated through the years by believers and considered sacred.  It's not like one day there was the bible and people were only first ever exposed to these ideas at that time.

Since events in bible are more like legends, not historical events (lets be real), how did those who wrote it, made people believe something like that in the first place. \nSo for example, someone wrote some story regarding some event. Then someone other wrote something about the some other event which is in correlation with the first one, etc. It must start from somewhere, and when it started there was no stories through the years, and it wasn't considered sacred.

I think that it sexualizes the genitalia which is a good thing, sexuality is a powerful and amazing component of the human experience and I have no interest in seeing everyone naked all the time. I don't want to look at a naked body and go \"so? just saw that on the bus on the way over here\".\n\nIn addition to that there is research showing that a separate part of the brain is activated when taboo things take place which explains a lot of why many people don't like to hear swearing. Obviously if everyone was naked all the time it would mean the human body is not a taboo, which I think erodes the power of sexuality, but it doesn't change the fact that it is a very uncomfortable experience for people who have that taboo, which is almost everyone. Personally, I can think of few things I'd rather do less than go somewhere that may be the equivalent of a YMCA men's change room, but apparently that's just me.\n\nPersonally I would rather teach my (non-existent) child that is too young to understand the actual reasons behind the rules that your genitals are your \"private parts\" and you shouldn't be showing yours to anyone, touching them in front of others, touching others in those places, and if anyone else tries to show you theirs, touch theirs in front of you or touch yours you should say no and leave immediately and get help. There is an extraordinarily fine line for small children between a normal childhood and a traumatic experience that fucks you up for life which you don't even realise until you get older, and I don't see what benefit is actually gained from letting adults, who of course have an inherent position of power over any child they are in the presence of, erode the understanding of that line for anyone just because they don't feel like putting on clothes. There are already designated places where people can be nude, and no children are allowed. I don't think anyone should be subjected to the nudity of others if they don't want to and I don't think children should at all, so I don't see why it isn't sufficient to have these designated places and leave the public space as somewhere where it is considered appropriate to wear clothes. Having to be in a literal YMCA men's change room as a child is weird enough but there is an important context there of why people are naked and if anyone is naked even there for any amount of time that is substantially longer than necessary to change clothes I think it is reasonable to be a least a little bit suspicious of their motives.", "id": "d5n469n"}, {"comment": "but why do you think that?

It's important to remember that technically large portions of India were subjugated/conquered/brought into the empire not by Britain acting formally as Britain, but by the East India Trading Company (Britain did not take over direct control until 1858). It was overseen by the British Government and had access to British troops (although the majority of their forces were sepoy regiments officered by EIC officers), but the EIC governors on the ground in India had a lot of wiggle room both because of that arrangement and because (as u/fatoms mentioned), communication was slow enough that they could often present London with a fait accompli. Finally, it became clear to Britain that they were punching well above their own weight in great power affairs, and it was the empire that allowed them to do that, and so it had to be preserved. Large portions of the empire were taken and protected with imperial manpower, not British manpower, and that manpower needed to come from somewhere.

It was overseen by the British Government and had access to British troops (although the majority of their forces were sepoy regiments officered by EIC officers), but the EIC governors on the ground in India had a lot of wiggle room both because of that arrangement and because (as u/fatoms mentioned), communication was slow enough that they could often present London with a fait accompli. Finally, it became clear to Britain that they were punching well above their own weight in great power affairs, and it was the empire that allowed them to do that, and so it had to be preserved.

But to other Christians, her devout faith made her a hero.  She was eventually declared a saint by the Catholic Church. The heretic-or-saint question seems on the surface to be a religious dispute, but it was also a political one. The religious tribunal that convicted her was made up of English partisans. In the centuries after her death, French partisans (and eventually Catholic partisans, once the Reformation introduced Catholic-Protestant as another political fault line in Europe) treated her as a religious hero.

So many things wrong with this, I don't know where to start, *but*....\n\nWhen, finally, we get past the stupid and seemingly pointless diatribes about \"merchants of death\" and arms manufacturers and conspiracies to involve the US in foreign wars and we get to the meat of the article: what would have happened if the Allies lost WWI? And immediately we run into trouble. \n\n>By the summer of 1917, the Western Allies had exhausted their credit in U.S. financial markets. Without direct U.S. government-to-government aid, they could not have afforded any more offensives in the West. \n\nWell, even if that's true, that doesn't mean the Allies would have lost. It certainly doesn't mean the US had to send soldiers to fight in the trenches. Why not merely provide financial assistance? Even if for reasons of economy the Allies launched no offensives (and I doubt that would have seriously restricted their offensive efforts; manpower was always a more severe problem than materiel after 1915), then they simply would have waited. They may not have launched any further offensives in 1918, but they would have in 1919, and if not 1919, 1920. But they wouldn't have to wait for 1920, because Germany would have collapsed of exhaustion well before then. \n\nThe author makes it sound as if Germany's economy was fundamentally stronger than the Allies....but it wasn't. Sure, it was larger than either Britain or France, but it was a lot less efficient and it was starved of many essential resources due to the naval blockade (maintained, not by the United States but by the British Royal Navy). In short, the Allies would have waited, because they could out-wait the Germans. The German war economy was substantially weaker than the Allied war economy, and by 1918 hunger was a serious problem in Germany. Even absent battlefield success (or even activity), the Allies would have no reason to go to the negotiating table in 1918 nor any reason to suspend the war when they were more capable of sustaining it than were the Germans. But 1918 was not a year of inactivity, it was actually a year of tremendous battlefield success on the part of the Allies\n\n>Minus U.S. reinforcements on land and sea, it\u2019s difficult to imagine how the Allies could have defeated a Germany that had knocked revolutionary Russia out of the war.\n\nUm....pretty much how they *did* defeat Germany. First of all, yes, Germany knocked Russia out of the war in 1917, but that's not so much an indication of how strong Germany was, it's more a statement of how weak Russia was by 1917. \n\nSecondly, I'm not going to deny that American soldiers helped defeat Germany, but Americans were *not* the decisive factor. Germany collapsed from within largely due to inherent weaknesses in the German war economy and due to the collapse of her allies, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires (and the Americans fought neither). Moreover, Germany herself was defeated decisively on the battlefield and Americans played a tiny role in this. \n\nThe 100 Days Offensive in the summer/autumn of 1918 was a stunning British victory in which British generals masterfully used combined arms in a proto-blitzkrieg and British/Empire soldiers defeated their German foes on the battlefield; by the end of it, the German Army was in the beginning stages of collapse and would not be able to hold the field at all much longer. Moreover, the German economy was already straining by 1917, and by 1918 was, like the German army, on the verge of collapse, something which the Americans had virtually no influence on. Americans played only a very small part in this battlefield victory, though certainly Americans did contribute and they made a substantial contribution in the Spring Offensive earlier in the year, **but** it was the British Army and the Germans' own internal collapse that were most decisive in defeating Germany in 1918. So the idea that without direct American involvement on the battlefield in 1918 would have resulted in a defeat for the Allies is just nonsense.\n\nThis is important because *the rest of the article rests on the assumption that Allied victory in WWI was American-centric and America would have a large and important role to play in any peace conference, whether the Allies were victorious or defeated*. This is ignoring actual history, where the French and British were clearly the dominant players in the post-war peace conference and America (or, rather, President Wilson) largely failed to have a fraction of the effect he wanted at Versailles. Put shortly, the United States at Versailles in 1919 **was not** the United States at Potsdam or Yalta, as the author seems to believe. But instead the author ignores actual history and instead presents us a bizarre alternate timeline in which the Kaiser's Germany was akin to the Soviet Union in 1946.\n\n>Even if the Germans had traded concessions in the West to preserve their gains in the East, the kaiser\u2019s Germany would have emerged from such an outcome as the dominant power on the continent of Europe. \n\nUm, no. Given how weakened the Germans were by 1918, even if they had successfully negotiated WWI to an end, there's no way they would have been the dominant power in Europe. Eastern Europe was ablaze with ethnic strife and the fighting in Eastern Europe wouldn't end until the 1920s. For Germany to be the \"dominant power\" in Europe, it would have had to stamp out all the many ethnic factions fighting to carve out territory from the former Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman Empires, something which was simply beyond the military capacity of Germany by 1918, even if it had negotiated its war against France/UK/US to an end. A negotiated peace in 1918 probably would have left Germany intact and probably with much of her possessions in East Prussia, but Germany would just barely have been able to stave off revolution and civil war within its own country, so whether it could project its power on any other part of Europe is very much in doubt. \n\n>The United States would have found itself after such a negotiated peace confronting the same outcome as it faced in 1946: a Europe divided between East and West, with the battered West looking to the United States for protection.\n\nWell, no. 1919 was fundamentally different from 1946; leaving aside questions of an ideological struggle between communism and capitalism (and the nuclear dimension to things), in 1946 all of Eastern Europe and a lot of Central Europe was united under the Soviet jackboot. In 1919, pretty much all of Europe south or east of Germany was in tatters and disunited--four empires (German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian) had just collapsed, virtually overnight. Half of Europe was up for grabs.  Even in the scenario the author presents where the Germans have \"won\" by negotiation, that would not change the fact that most of Europe is suddenly no longer under an Imperial yoke of some sort. In 1946, it was a very clear \"us\" vs \"them\" situation--free Europe vs. Communist Europe. No such clear dividing line can be found in 1919, which is much closer to \"everyone vs. everyone else\". Hell, even within Germany, *Bavaria* tried to break away from Germany in 1919.\n\nThe idea that Europe would be divided, most of it under the Kaiser's control/influence, is ridiculous, but only slightly more ridiculous is the idea that the rest of Europe would rally around the United States. Why should they? In 1946, they had to, because the US was the only free industrialized economy still standing, everyone else was a bombed out, burnt out, broken down shell or (in the case of Britain) completely and utterly bankrupt (or both). The same was not true in 1919, when France and Britain were down but not out. And, as reality shows, Wilson got completely outmaneuvered by the French and British at Versailles; there is no reason to believe that would be any different in the alternate timeline posited by the author. \n\n>Had the Western Allies lost the First World War, European democracy would have failed the test that American democracy surmounted in the Civil War: the test of survival in the competition between nations and regimes.\n\nExcept....European democracy **did fail** even *after* the Allies *won* WWI. By the author's own admission, Italy and Japan (both on the Allied side in WWI) went in the complete wrong direction, becoming fascist, totalitarian states after WWI, as did a host of other European countries. Hell, Spain became fascist after WWI, and they weren't even involved in the war!\n\nIt's just a very strange thing to suggest, that the answer to the big \"what if\" of \"What if the Allies lost WWI?\" is \"Europe wouldn't have become democratic\" when a lot of Europe *didn't* become democratic even after the Allies won WWI. It was WWII and the eventual western triumph in the Cold War that ensured European democracy finally prevailed, not Allied victory or defeat in WWI. \n\nTLDR, this is a pretty terrible article that should have been titled \"What would have happened if **America** hadn't won WWI\"--and the answer to that question is pretty much \"what *did* happen\". \n\nThis article is an example of what happens when an American author (with not a terribly good grasp of WWI, it seems) tries to take an America-centric view on a historical event in which the United States was honestly not really all that important. The US wasn't really all that important to the outcome of WWI and didn't have much of an effect on the subsequent peace process, and there is little reason to believe that would be very different had the Allies failed to defeat Germany in 1918.

And it wouldn't have been even similar to the east vs. west like in the otl cold war. Germany would have asserted its influence over central, northern and eastern Europe and would have tried to keep the status quo. Being bottled in between a revanchist Russia, France and Britain it would have tried to prevent a new war.\n\n\n>As in 1946, the East would have been dominated by an authoritarian regime that looked upon the liberal and democratic Anglo-American West not just as a geopolitical antagonist, but as an ideological threat.\n\nThe Kaiserreich was in facht much more democratic and than Soviet Russia and less aggressive. To compare those two is logical fallacy.\n\n\n> In other words, the United States would have gotten an early start on the Cold War, and maybe a second hot war, supported by fewer and weaker allies against a richer and more dangerous opponent\u2014and one quite likely to have developed the atomic bomb and the intercontinental ballistic missile first.\n\nThis assumes that the US would have had any interest in Europe. The US was mainly interested in trading with Europe, which would have been in the Kaiserreichs interested.\n\n\n>By the time Wilson delivered his \u201csafe for democracy\u201d war message, however, the war had taken a new form. Britain would emerge from the war as a country in which all adult men voted, and soon adult women too.\n\nThe same is very much troo for both Germany and Austria.\n\n\n>Russia was racked by a revolution that would overthrow the tsar. \nWhile Kerensky wanted to bring true Democracy to the people he didn't do it during the war and was overthrown because he antagonized a huge faction of the russian people.\n\n\n>The smaller, neutral nations of Europe\u2014notably Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden\u2014democratized during and after the First World War.\n\nIt's interesting that all those countries the author listed were very pro German and suffered much under the Entente blockade.\n\nSweden and Denmark were even considered de facto allies of Germany in the Baltics and the north sea.\n\n\n>The nations that gained independence as a result of the war\u2014the Baltic republics, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Poland\u2014were organized as democracies at least at the start.\n\nIt's interesting because Lithuania, Finland, Poland and Ukraine were initially  set up as German puppets and saw the Kaisers forces as liberators.\n\nUkraine was later swallowed by the Soviet Union and the Entente forces weren't able to support the Belorussian independence movement.\n\n\n>Meanwhile, the Central Powers receded from democracy during the war. Before 1914, Germany and the Habsburg Empire could display elected national legislatures, but these legislatures exerted little control over the actions of government and during the war years lost what little influence they had.\n\nWhen it comes to Military and economic matters the Author is right, but he ignores the fact that the German and Austro-Hungarian parliaments still had full financial and internal authority and managed to get major concessions to increase democracy after the war. \n\n>Where the Central Powers organized new governments\u2014notably in Ukraine\u2014they instituted authoritarian or military regimes. \n\nWhich is the same the US did in South Korea and supported in Taiwan and it worked out well. The author ignores the democracies Finland and Lithuania which got major support by the Central Powers.\n\n>Had the Western Allies lost the First World War, European democracy would have failed the test that American democracy surmounted in the Civil War: the test of survival in the competition between nations and regimes.\n\nConsidering that it did anyway in OTL and on a scale that is unimaginably horrible, the authors claim is pretty weak.\n\n>Any aggressive illiberal power must fear the United States as the ultimate potential check on its aspirations. So it was with Germany in 1917. So it is with Iran today.\n\nHere he makes two interesting statements. First he makes the claim that Germany was an aggressive and illiberal Power and that the US wasn't, something which is doubtful if we look at the historical track record of both the US and Germany between 1870 and 1918. \n\nSecondly he makes the claim of the US being a \"world police\" with his comparrison to Iran. \n\nThe US foreign policy has so far mostly undermined reasonable attempts to find a settlement with Iran that would keep the mid east stable.\n\n>DAVID FRUM is a senior editor at The Atlantic and the chairman of Policy Exchange.

In 1919, pretty much all of Europe south or east of Germany was in tatters and disunited--four empires (German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian) had just collapsed, virtually overnight. Half of Europe was up for grabs. Even in the scenario the author presents where the Germans have \"won\" by negotiation, that would not change the fact that most of Europe is suddenly no longer under an Imperial yoke of some sort. In 1946, it was a very clear \"us\" vs \"them\" situation--free Europe vs. Communist Europe. No such clear dividing line can be found in 1919, which is much closer to \"everyone vs. everyone else\". Hell, even within Germany, Bavaria tried to break away from Germany in 1919.\n\nAll this still implies American intervention in 1917. Were that not the case, the Germans would certainly have solidified their grip on Eastern Europe, and would have been in a position of immense power. Control of the Ploesti Oilfields and the Black Sea, for example.\n\n> The idea that Europe would be divided, most of it under the Kaiser's control/influence, is ridiculous, but only slightly more ridiculous is the idea that the rest of Europe would rally around the United States. Why should they? In 1946, they had to, because the US was the only free industrialized economy still standing, everyone else was a bombed out, burnt out, broken down shell or (in the case of Britain) completely and utterly bankrupt (or both). The same was not true in 1919, when France and Britain were down but not out. And, as reality shows, Wilson got completely outmaneuvered by the French and British at Versailles; there is no reason to believe that would be any different in the alternate timeline posited by the author. \n\nYour clearly going off the highschool version of events. Read *Griff Nach Der Weltmacht* by Fritz Fischer, and tell me Germany wouldn't dominate Europe. Then read *Paris 1919* by Margaret MacMillan and tell me that Wilson was 'bamboozled.'\n\n> Except....European democracy did fail even after the Allies won WWI. By the author's own admission, Italy and Japan (both on the Allied side in WWI) went in the complete wrong direction, becoming fascist, totalitarian states after WWI, as did a host of other European countries. Hell, Spain became fascist after WWI, and they weren't even involved in the war!\n\nDemocracy lasted in Czechoslovakia until partition, In Ireland from 1923 onwards, in Poland until 1921 and then again in the late 30s until the Second World War. It lasted in Yugoslavia until 1924, and was revived in the 1930s after Alexander's death. It lasted in Japan until the 1930s, as it did in Germany. It lasted in Spain until the early thirties, although there were some ups and downs. Ignoring the fact that Democracy became more than just a remote possibility in Europe after WWII does you little credit.\n\n> The US wasn't really all that important to the outcome of WWI and didn't have much of an effect on the subsequent peace process, and there is little reason to believe that would be very different had the Allies failed to defeat Germany in 1918. This article is just mental masturbation indulging in the fantasy that the US is sublime at manipulating world events and shaping the world in its image, when history begs to differ.\n\nAs I trust I've conveyed, you're pretty spectacularly wrong. The involvement of the United States was extremely important, strategically if not tactically, in Allied victory in WWI. The Allies sought to create a framework more conducive to peace than that before the war, and by 1929 they had largely succeeded. That the Great Depression plunged Europe into crisis was not something forseen in 1919, and your using hindsight only damages your case. As anoyher recommendation, read *The Deluge* by Adam Tooze; or, swing by /r/AskHistorians!", "id": "d1tw78w"}, {"comment": "First of all, let's be clear about the alternate timeline it is we are discussing. We are *not* talking about a swift German victory in 1914, where they beat the French/British at the Marne, occupy Paris, and the Allies negotiate a favorable peace for Germany--**which would indeed have left Germany the dominant power in Europe**. However, as laid out by the author in the article, what we *are* talking about is Germany experiencing success against the Allies late in the war after defeating Russia in 1917 and after Americans refuse to send either soldiers or money to the Allied cause. In such a scenario, Germany would still be substantially weakened by the war effort, even if victorious, the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires would still be in a state of collapse, and the peace treaty liable to be signed by the French/British is one which is likely to be favorable to Germany, though I suspect the British would still have insisted on Germany vacating Belgium and Alsace/Lorraine would be returned to France, and they probably could have gotten concessions from Germany on the fate of Eastern Europe depending on how exactly the alternate war unfolded. \n\n(A sidenote: I think the details of the negotiated peace in this alternate timeline are rather important to the question \"what if\" and so the author in quickly glossing over the details is doing himself and us a disservice *and* I think it would be worth discussing separately what the details of such a negotiated peace would be).  \n\n>British credit had all but run out by Spring 1917; without government-to-government loans via the Inter-Allied Fund, Britain and France would have been in very hot water. \n\nTrue, I'm not denying that the US was important as a source of funds for the Allies, *but*, even if the French and British had not received direct inter-govt. assistance beginning in 1917, they still could have carried on the war. They probably would have just resorted to recklessly printing money and selling bits of their empires if not outright pillaging their own economies (raiding savings accounts, selling off the last of their bullion reserves, etc.). Undoubtedly this would have wrecked their economies before too long, but it would have enabled them to carry on the war, at least for a little while. It would have been more difficult, certainly, but not impossible, and it would not have immediately led to France/Britain going to the negotiating table with Germany, as the author suggests. It may have done, depending on subsequent events and how well Britain/France were able to squeeze their economies after running out of credit, but the fact remains that France and Britain's war economies were fundamentally on sounder footing than Germany's, with or without American financial aid (though again, I readily concede American financial aid was of substantial importance). Perhaps the most important thing about this is that without American financial/military aid, Allied defeat was not assured *and* without American involvement, the US would have had *no* effect on the peace process at all (after all, how could a power that was not a belligerent in the war in this alternate timeline be given a place at the peace conference except as a mediator? and how would it have significant leverage as a non-belligerent?). \n\n>[American troops] allowed the Allied offensives of 1918 to take place along the whole front and with ample reserves\n\nAgain, true, but the importance of American troops is overstated. The Spring Offensive was arguably the decisive event in 1918 and American soldiers played only a minor role in that event. The majority of American soldiers arrived in France in the summer of 1918, after the Spring Offensive had failed. And arguably, after the SO failed, the Germans were already defeated (*arguably*; nothing in history is inevitable of course). The Spring Offensive exhausted the last vestiges of the German war economy, killed off most of Germany's best troops, *and* left Germany holding a bunch of exposed territory, to say nothing of its effect on German morale. In other words, not only did Germany blunt their spear quite considerably with the Spring Offensive, they also overextended themselves by capturing territory beyond the fortified lines they'd been working on since 1916, territory which they would have struggled to hold on to even with the army they had at the beginning of 1918, let alone after the disastrous end of the Spring Offensive. \n\nThe key question is: would the Germans have succeeded in Spring 1918 without American doughboys on the ground? Possibly, but it seems rather unlikely since the defeat of the SO seemed to hinge more on German exhaustion than Allied action. It's possible the Germans would have come close enough to outright success the British/French pushed for an armistice, but even then that wouldn't have given Germany a carte blanche in the peace process. And, if the stuffing had been knocked out of the German Army in the SO, did the Allies even need reserves for the 100 Days Offensive? Certainly it's nice to have reserves, but the French and British probably could have managed without the Americans if Foch was willing to take a gamble. \n\nTLDR: militarily, the Americans were barely a token contributor. They certainly helped, but without them the end result *probably* would have been the same. Moreover, even with their actual military contribution, that did not automatically make them masters of Europe in 1919 in the same way the Americans kind of were in 1945 (for Western Europe at least).  \n\n>All this still implies American intervention in 1917\n\nNo it doesn't. If the Americans had not intervened militarily, the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman Empires still would have collapsed, and even if the Germans had negotiated a peace in 1918, their empire still would have been under considerable strain. They likely would have been able to retain their dominance over Poland (even that though is questionable), but beyond that I doubt they would have been able to influence much.  If anything, without American intervention on the Western Front the war in the west would have gone on longer, keeping the Germans preoccupied there and giving Eastern/Central Europe more time to distance itself from the various empires they'd been ruled by before the Germans began to consolidate their hold on Europe. Can you agree that if the German Army was busy fighting the British/French/Belgians/Italians/Portuguese into 1919 that it would have been largely unable to establish a dominant German presence in Eastern/Central Europe at the same time?\n\n>the Germans would certainly have solidified their grip on Eastern Europe\n\nHow? And with what? Money? Troops? Does the Austro-Hungarian Empire stay intact in this scenario? Because that is the only way I can see Germany in 1918/1919 maintaining firm control on Eastern/Central Europe. However, even if Germany had negotiated a favorable treaty with the Allies in 1918 or 1919, I don't think the Austro-Hungarian Empire would have survived, and once it was gone Eastern/Central Europe was bound to devolve into the ethnic milieu with everyone fighting for their own nation-state. Without Versailles they probably would have fought bloody civil/ethnic wars even longer than they in fact did; ditto the Balkans. While Germany might have had enough strength left to defeat some of them, it couldn't have defeated all the nascent nation-states trying to gain independence in 1918 (and this doesn't even raise the question of whether Germany would have been willing to make such an effort). Likewise, the Russian Civil War would still have happened and it would still have given places like Ukraine and Finland breathing room to fight for independence, regardless of what happened on the Western Front. \n\nUndoubtedly some of the emerging nation states would have fallen into Germany's sphere of influence, either as a means of achieving independence or as a pragmatic means of staving off direct rule by Germany, but not all of them, and they would have been free to drift away from Germany's orbit (probably into Soviet clutches) at any point in the future. Fundamentally, I fail to see what the broke, starving, and drained Imperial Germany would have had to offer to these new states arising in Eastern/Central Europe and I fail to see how Imperial Germany could have forcibly subjugated them, and all of this assumes the favorable treaty or armistice the Germans get in 1918/1919 had nothing to say about Eastern/Central Europe, which is not a given. The long and short of it is that even if Germany had 'won' in 1918 or 1919, it still would have been very, very weakened by WWI, Eastern Europe would have been a mess, and I just don't see how Germany in its weakened state could have imposed its will on the rest of Eastern Europe, at least, not immediately. Over the following 20 years it probably would have devolved into a contest between a rebuilt Imperial Germany and an ascendant Soviet Union vying for allies and satellite states in Eastern Europe, but even then it's a contest for the loyalty of independent states, and it leaves open the possibility of British/French meddling later on.\n\nPlease see my next comment for more.", "id": "d1u427g"}, {"comment": "Cont'd\n\n>Your clearly going off the high school version of events.\n\nHigh school version of events for 1945/46 or 1919? Or both? As it happens, I did read *Paris 1919* after listening to a very good (and critical) lecture on the book by one of my history professors at university, though sadly this was a few years ago and my memory of it has faded. Given that, I will readily defer to you on the matter, but my main take-away from it was that Wilson largely got what he wanted (not entirely though) but France and Britain still got what they wanted (particularly in the Middle East), at Germany's expense. Correct me if I'm wrong (and I probably am), but it's not that Wilson was 'bamboozled', he simply had different aims than the Europeans, aims which were not mutually exclusive with what the British/French wanted. \n\n>Ignoring the fact that Democracy became more than just a remote possibility in Europe after WWII does you little credit.\n\nAnd yet the fact remains that democracy in Europe was not guaranteed by Allied victory in WWI, *nor does Allied defeat in WWI preclude the possibility of democracy*. \n\nI think this is the central bone of contention. The author is saying Allied victory in WWI *combined with American influence at the peace process and in the military victory* is what led to Europe becoming democratic, and therefore we can conclude that Allied defeat (as a result of American absence) would have doomed Europe to a non-democratic future under Imperial Germany\u2019s domination. \n\nThis though ignores the fact that not all of Europe became democratic after WWI, nor did it stay democratic even after the Allies did win and even after the Americans did influence the peace process. Therefore it was not WWI which made Europe \u201csafe for democracy\u201d\u2014since, as history shows us, democracy in Interwar Europe was not safe. It perished in multiple places in Europe between WWI and WWII, as you yourself have said. It was WWII (and arguably not even the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 but the collapse of the USSR in 1991) which ratified democracy as the future of Europe, not WWI. And again, if we look at the title of the article, the author would have us believe that Europe would never have become democratic if Germany had won (which is possible if Germany had won in 1914, but is very doubtful in the event of a German victory in 1918/1919). \n\nMoreover, even if the Allies had been defeated in 1918/1919, this does not mean democracy in Europe was dead. In this alternate timeline, Britain and France would still be free and relatively democratic (by the standards of their day, not ours), as would be Ireland, undoubtedly, since Home Rule was already seen as inevitable by 1914 and had pretty much been ratified by the events within Ireland during the course of the war. Moreover, no matter the outcome of Alternate WWI, it would still have been a tremendous cataclysm and upheaval, one which destroyed at least 3 empires (assuming in this alternate timeline the German Empire survived in a weakened state). There is no way the author can plausibly claim that in the wake of this upheaval, none of the nascent nation-states in Eastern/Central Europe would have achieved independence and become democratic. \n\nTLDR: in both factual and alternate 1919, Europe had not been made safe for democracy, as the author claims. Democracies could exist in Factual 1919 Europe, but their mere existence does not mean democracy was safe since they were also capable of being swept away by either internal or external forces, as many of them were. And finally, the only plausible scenario in which the future of a democratic Europe is stamped out forever is a swift German victory over the Entente in 1914, which is *not* the scenario the author is discussing. By 1918, even if the Allies had lost and even if the US had not become involved, the war had been going on for so long and had had such devastating effects that a re-shaping of Europe along democratic lines can't simply be dismissed as impossible. \n\n--especially since the alternate timeline presented to us is not one of decisive German victory \u00e0 la 1870 but is instead a stalemate where Germany is essentially allowed to keep what it already had, plus or minus some gains made in Eastern Europe. Even if Germany 'won' in this timeline, it still may have suffered significant internal instability in subsequent years--greater demands for liberal reforms/more democracy, industrial strikes, insubordination in the army, etc. In such an environment--a fractured Europe with a much weakened Germany at its center--democracy was not off the table entirely, any more than it was guaranteed in the actual event of Allied victory (because, ultimately, the Allies were not fighting for democracy). \n\n>The US wasn't really all that important to the outcome of WWI\n\nLet me clarify my earlier remarks by adding \"the US wasn't really all that important to the outcome of WWI *militarily*\". Financially, yes, the US was hugely important, but the role of the US military was actually very limited--which forces us to conclude that, absent American military commitment, the outcome of WWI would not have been substantially different. Even if the outcome did turn out differently, that does not support the author's central premise that if Germany had managed to win a negotiated peace with the Allies in 1918/1919 absent of US involvement the rest of Europe would have rallied around the United States in 1919 like it did in 1945/46. Indeed, even the assertion that Germany would have been the major European hegemon in such a scenario is not without issues, but there is very little reason to think that Europe would have turned to the US as an alternative to Germany when France and Britain still had intact global Empires and national armies. \n\nI mean, if Germany won *because the US did not get involved*, why then would 'free Europe' turn to the US, a nation un-involved in Europe? Why would Europe look to the US as an alternative to Germany, in this scenario, when the US was absent from European affairs and it was precisely this American absence which led to Germany becoming dominant? To me it seems to be an irreconcilable contradiction upon which the author's premise rests. \n\nIndeed, his entire thesis is troubled: if the Allies lost in WWI, it would have been because the US did not become involved militarily and did not offer the Allies $$$. As a result, Germany gets a negotiated peace in which it cedes its gains in the West so that it can keep its gains in the East, leaving it the dominant power in Europe (even though, in this scenario, France and Britain retain their Empires and successfully fought Imperial Germany to a stand-still in Western Europe; the author however ignores what if any influence they would have had in this alternate Europe). Subsequently, the rest of Europe not under Germany's heel turns to the US as an alternative power--even though it was America's disinterest in the fate of Europe which caused Allied defeat in the first place and in this alternate timeline there is no reason to believe America's disinterest in Europe has at all changed. Europe subsequently does not become democratic (like it allegedly did in the wake of Allied victory in WWI).  \n\n", "id": "d1u4lhm"}], [{"comment": "To be frank I don't consider WW1 anything but a ceasefire.

And it wouldn't have been even similar to the east vs. west like in the otl cold war.

Being bottled in between a revanchist Russia, France and Britain it would have tried to prevent a new war.\n\n\n>As in 1946, the East would have been dominated by an authoritarian regime that looked upon the liberal and democratic Anglo-American West not just as a geopolitical antagonist, but as an ideological threat.\n\nThe Kaiserreich was in facht much more democratic and than Soviet Russia and less aggressive. To compare those two is logical fallacy.\n\n\n> In other words, the United States would have gotten an early start on the Cold War, and maybe a second hot war, supported by fewer and weaker allies against a richer and more dangerous opponent\u2014and one quite likely to have developed the atomic bomb and the intercontinental ballistic missile first.\n\nThis assumes that the US would have had any interest in Europe.

Before 1914, Germany and the Habsburg Empire could display elected national legislatures, but these legislatures exerted little control over the actions of government and during the war years lost what little influence they had.\n\nWhen it comes to Military and economic matters the Author is right, but he ignores the fact that the German and Austro-Hungarian parliaments still had full financial and internal authority and managed to get major concessions to increase democracy after the war. \n\n>Where the Central Powers organized new governments\u2014notably in Ukraine\u2014they instituted authoritarian or military regimes. \n\nWhich is the same the US did in South Korea and supported in Taiwan and it worked out well.

The Western front had 66 divisions deployed mostly in France. However you need to take into account that there were a further 27 divisions deployed fighting the western Allies in Italy and another 23 in Southeastern Europe mostly to prevent a possible Allied invasion through Greece as Churchill advocated. So when you do the math the Western allies were tying down or directly fighting 110 vs. the 160 in the East hardly the 10 to 1 you cited. I picked June 1944 deployments in particular because they represent a good average of the number and disposition of German troops between 1943 and 1945. After June the Germans actually shift more troops to the West by December they have almost 80 on the Western front.\n\nNow none of this means that the Russians didn't do the lions share of the fighting or the dying, something like 8 in 10 German deaths were on the Eastern front. What it does mean though is that without Western allied activity the Russians probably could not have won the war on their own. It is hard to imagine things like Operation Bagration succeeding if the Germans had an extra 100 divisions at their disposal on the Eastern Front.\n\nEvery allied nation contributed in their way and it is a rather worthless argument to discuss who really won the war.

I have never heard that he did so a source would be super enlightening. As far as I know what Stalin really wanted was a second front of active fighting opened to relieve pressure not allied troops in the Soviet Union.\n\nSecond is that at the time in which Western troops may have been useful 1941- early 1943 they simply weren't ready for a large deployment. Operation Torch was the best that allied forces could muster in late 42 and included a paltry by eastern front standards 100,000 troops. The allies planned an invasion of France as early as 1942 with operation Sledgehammer but the idea was quickly abandoned mostly due to America being ill prepared to contribute significant troops.  With the summer 1943 invasion of Italy though the Russians got what they wanted a second front in Europe that resulted in 27 divisions pulled directly from the Eastern Front as German numbers in France did not decline.\n\nLast but not least we have so far failed to even mention the huge importance of Allied particularly American lend lease aid to Russia. Theige brought it up only to be down voted which is strange. The US delivered 400,000 trucks and Jeeps, 12,000 armored vehicles, almost 3 million tons of gas and oil, almost 2 million tons of food, and over 11,000 aircraft to the Russians. Most importantly well over 2,000 locomotives and 10,000 rolling stock. Maybe even more important and timely was the British contribution of small but significant numbers of Tanks and fighter aircraft in late 1941. Many of which played an important roll in the defense of Moscow.   \n\nWhat I have proven in my original post is that the Western Allies successfully tied up around 40% of Germany's combat strength.

I would defer to the leadership on the ground for this one. The Normandy campaign still took almost a month to really break out of the beach head area and a less well prepared force may not have succeeded at all.\n\nSecondly did it even matter if the Western Allies actually invaded?

It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million.

While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.\n\n##Further Reading\n* \"[Third Reich Trilogy](https://books.google.com/books?id=HZmXOPGTGjIC)\" by Richard Evans\n* \"[Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7FiPwAACAAJ)\" by Ian Kershaw\n* \"[Auschwitz: A New History](https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-dZEV228QC)\" by Laurence Rees\n* \"[Ordinary Men](https://books.google.com/books?id=HFB-dkuZzSwC)\" by Christopher Browning\n* \"[Denying History](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-0B9-D5Vz4C)\" by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman\n* [/r/AskHistorians FAQ](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwii#wiki_nazi_germany)\n\n*I "], [3, "> Adolf Hitler, obviously as the example of when bad deeds versus good intentions goes wrong. I want to find something on how he saved the German economy, albeit only temporarily, but most documentaries tend to be focused on the more Holocaust-y side of his career.\n\nAs a German, I have to say that I'm really uncomfortable with your wording. Hitler didn't save the German economy. He ordered an industry of war to be created that was partially funded by expropriated minorities, but couldn't sustain itself naturally and wasn't profit-orientated in the first place. Everything was made and planned with war and expansion in mind. And while it had positive, economic side effects on the population for a brief period of time, I really have a hard time to see the \"good intentions\" here. The end goal was always war, extermination of minorites, total control, large-scale occupation of foreign territory and cleansing.

From 1933 to 1939, the Nazi government always spent more than it earned so that by 1939, government debt stood at over 40 billion Resichsmarks.

Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.\n\n##Further Reading\n* \"[Third Reich Trilogy](https://books.google.com/books?id=HZmXOPGTGjIC)\" by Richard Evans\n* \"[Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7FiPwAACAAJ)\" by Ian Kershaw\n* \"[Auschwitz: A New History](https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-dZEV228QC)\" by Laurence Rees\n* \"[Ordinary Men](https://books.google.com/books?id=HFB-dkuZzSwC)\" by Christopher Browning\n* \"[Denying History](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-0B9-D5Vz4C)\" by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman\n* [/r/AskHistorians FAQ](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwii#wiki_nazi_germany)\n\n*I ", "id": "d2c1jcn"}], [{"comment": "> Adolf Hitler, obviously as the example of when bad deeds versus good intentions goes wrong. I want to find something on how he saved the German economy, albeit only temporarily, but most documentaries tend to be focused on the more Holocaust-y side of his career.\n\nAs a German, I have to say that I'm really uncomfortable with your wording. Hitler didn't save the German economy. He ordered an industry of war to be created that was partially funded by expropriated minorities, but couldn't sustain itself naturally and wasn't profit-orientated in the first place. Everything was made and planned with war and expansion in mind. And while it had positive, economic side effects on the population for a brief period of time, I really have a hard time to see the \"good intentions\" here. The end goal was always war, extermination of minorites, total control, large-scale occupation of foreign territory and cleansing.

So one shouldn't become biased just because Hitler initiated WW2 and his system commited reprehensible crimes. As far as \"good intentions\" are concerned, Hitler was a well-respected politician before the outbreak of war. In my opinion he wanted Germany to ascend to the number one spot in the world in all sectors.

There isn't really a perfectly pithy way to cover such a complex topic, but much better than winners writing history is *writers* writing history. This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have \"lost\" the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus, but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within (or at least sympathetic towards) that order, and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.\n\nOf course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias.

You need to remember that Europe has a history of big wars where large parts of country's and kingdoms were lost or gained so Germany knowing this created the the Schlieffen Plan which would allow them to, if executed correctly win the war, defend both their borders and if they're lucky maybe even go home with some land. Had this war come 20 years earlier technology wise i'm extremely confident in saying that German would have been able to successfully execute the Schlieffen Plan, beat France(and England if needed) and then go onto beat Russia.

That wound up being just one of many decisions that handicapped their fighting in Alsace-Lorraine.\n\n> The same France that was willing to alter the Franco-Russian military alliance against Germany which originally explicitly excluded a Balkan war as a valid trigger for the offensive attack against Germany as called for by the treaty. The same France that decided it was willing to accept a Balkan trigger in return for Russia agreeing to make Germany the primary focus of its offensive instead of Austria (which would naturally be the country fighting in the Balkans, not Germany).\n\nFrench entreaties to Russia to attack Germany were founded upon the knowledge that **France** would be the first power attacked by Germany, given that France was closest to Germany's major rail networks and had the lesser population. There was no 'balkanization' of the French alliance beyond the usual 'big talk' from Poincare. Hell, in 1914 the Banque Internationale de Paris (BIP) and the Credit Anstalt, the central banks of France and Austria-Hungary, were cooperating on development projects in the Balkans, while Steyr and Schneider were both arming Serbia.\n\n> The same France which Britain knew, and even warned Germany, would be likely to attack Germany if there were a war in the Balkans? (Sec Grey to Count Lichnowsky, Dec 1912, in the context of the Balkan War).\n\nThe scenario given to Grey by Lichnowsky involved a **German** attack on France, not the other way around. And the British would support France in the hopes of maintaining a continental balance of power, just as they intervened to prevent the Russians from escalating things over the Turkish Strait dispute of 1913-14, and cooperated with the Germans for a peaceful solution to the 1912-13 Balkan Wars.\n\n> The same France which financed the construction on a military rail system into Poland to speed to deployment of Russian armies against Germany?\n\nWell French funds financed Russian railroads in general, although by 1913 German finance had begun to compete with France in investments in Russia! And considering that Germany was an ally of Austria-Hungary, and that Poland was a **salient** that they could encircle, building railroads there made sense. in the end, 2/3rds of the new rails built with French and Russian capital along the western border were opposite Austria-Hungary, as that was the primary power opposing Russia, so French influence was limited here. The rails in Poland were **still** under developed in 1914, as evidenced by the campaigns around Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. \n\n> The same France which updated its pre war campaign plans with Russia on a regular basis so the attack would be as coordinated as possible?\n\nWell, this is a military alliance; you would hope that both powers were coordinating as the expectation is that one will support the other. It certainly wasn't as dysfunctional as Austro-German \"cooperation\", but there rhetoric from the ruling elite counted for more in the end.\n\n> The same France which also financed a large military hardware upgrade for Serbia, Russia's puppet state and Austrian antagonist?\n\n\"Puppet state\" is a loaded term to use when the Russians themselves couldn't be sure what direction Serbian leaders would take in 1914. And as I mentioned, Austro-Hungarian firms were arming the Serbs as well as French; in fact, Steyr was in a cartel with Mauser, so by default Germany, Austria-Hungary **and** France were all arming the Serbs prior to 1914.\n\n> The same France who's ambassador to Russia advocated for conflict with Germany?\nThe same France who's President, while visiting Russia after the assassination, told the ambassador to encourage the Russians \"to remain firm and promise him our support.\"\n\nAdvocating for war was one matter; actually taking concrete measures to spark one is another. Case in point with Poincare's visit; he made the usual 'big talk' that one would expect from an official meeting of heads of state, but that was about as far as such rhetoric could be taken. Especially in light of Joffre's failed efforts in July 1914 to get a more concrete French commitment in July 1914. \n\n> The same France described on July 30 1914 by the Russian military attache in Paris as having \"unconcealed joy at the prospect of having the chance to use, as the French see it, beneficial strategic circumstances.\"\nThe same France described by a Belgian minister on the same day as \"The French general staff is favorable to war. The general staff desires war, because in its view the moment is favourable and the time has come to make an end of it.\"\n\nAnd again, what came of this? Considering that the Germans were already poised to attack westwards, what was any of this talk going to do, when it was **France** who stood to be invaded, and whose political leaders were still taking steps to avoid a conflict?\n\n> The same France who fought their first battle against the Germans on German soil? Sounds real defensive!\n\nWhen the Germans were invading Belgium so as to **invade France**? It made perfect sense to attack the Germans, so as to draw off German reserves from the main effort in the north. Joffre just sorely underestimated the extent of the German commitment through Belgium (ie 4 armies, reservist divisions committed), and then proved unwilling (surprise surprise) to admit that he'd screwed up. The French Plan XVII was confined to mobilization; Joffre's strategy took over from there, and was predicated on meeting and parrying a German thrust into France via Lorraine and southern Belgium. \n\n> Sounds like a nice group of peace loving peoples who were just roughly done by those vicious war mongering Huns!!!\n\nSounds like a country that was hardly peace loving, being roughly done by an enemy that was invested in the destruction or revision of the current balance of power, and opted for destruction.", "id": "d962xgt"}, {"comment": "I kind of want to keep arguing with you, because I think you've made some revisionist and selective comments while overlooking the fact that France didn't have to support Russia if they didn't actively want a war (assuming of course, that they hadn't balkanized the treaty, as you say).

The same thing had been happening to the Spanish Empire as Spain had fallen far behind when it came to France & G.B. whose industrialization took decades. The major area the Ottoman empire was industrialized at was burned down in the great fire of Smyrna. It more comes down to the Ottoman empire not believing they were falling behind, they had an unwillingness to accept what was happening to them. It finally became apparent throughout the empire when Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798. At that time the Hejaz was nothing more than a tourist attraction, the Ottoman conflicts with Persia from the 16th to 18th century was much more than a sunni and shia conflict and that greatly helped nations states like Greece (with the help of France, G.B. and Russia) gain their freedom from the Ottoman empire and finally most of the people in geographical Syria and Egypt consisted of pre-industrial cities etc.\n\nI dont see how religion had much of anything to do with the development of either side when it comes to the discussion of 'modern nation states', it mostly has to do with the Ottomans not believing they had fallen behind in the 18th century..

(I doubt Lutheranism and Calvinism would have survived if they weren't protected by their respective benefactors)  \nThe great empires in which Islam grew to be what it is today could denounce such reformations with a single decree.

The modern nation-state system has nothing to do with Christianity, it has to do with Europe vs. the Mediterranean. It's a lot easier to keep an empire together when you can travel around it by sea than when you have to cross the Alps. In the Byzantine Empire, the Emperor had a lot of control over the Patriarch, and in its region of influence (such as Russia and Armenia) the Church and the State were closely connected. In Italy the Pope ruled large territories directly. \n\nIt's true that there were parallel systems of Canon Law in Western Europe, but that's because of the fragmented nature of Europe and the Pope's lack of success in controlling what went on there.\n\n\n "], [1, "I think that one big difference was that Christianity was spread by missionary work to established nation-states while Islam was a religion attempting to create a nation-state. Much like the Greeks and Persians of old, early Islam simply failed to survive as a cohesive political unity in part because the control of a large area of land is hard thing to do.  \n\nBeyond that, the basis of any successful nation-state is a good economy not a religion. Most european nations became more successful economically as most Islamic countries went into decline as time went on. \n\nOn the issue of secularism. It's hard to say. Does secularism lead to success? Today it would appear so. But what is secularism?  The Romans were pagans and were both religious and successful. Zoroastrianism helped make the Persians very successful in the ancient middle east. Early Christianity and early Islam preserved the foundations of modern thought through literature and taught written language and encouraged public projects as well as being the foundation of most court cultures.  This is no longer true today, but in the past religion may have made all the difference in the modern secular world."], [1, "Christianity grew as it did due to the unshakeable convictions of its adherents. \"it took 300 years to gain a foothold in the Empire\", this is remarkable when we consider the non-political nature of the faith. There is evidence suggesting that the faith even reached Britain by the end of the first century via converted soldiers.\n\"Christianity's survival depended on the authority of the Roman empire\" I would refute. After all, it was during their greatest persecution that it spread most of all. When persecuted by Caesars (notably, Nero) it spread from Jerusalem to cover the whole of the Med and Asia Minor relatively quickly. It was clearly able to survive independently of the empire as it outlasted it and thrived whether favoured or opposed by it.\n\n\"Give to Caesar what is Caesars etc\" was a phrase coined decades before Christianity was known as an independent faith. Also, it was regarding devotion of property to rightful owner i.e taxes to Caesar and the whole self to God. Rather than a negotiation motto, it was a religious command to devote oneself to God as priority.\n\nI like very much your observation of Islam as an all encompassing religion with strong political motifs. As you say, it was as political and governing as it was spiritual from the get go.\n\nIMHO, Christianity and Islam evolved differently because 1. they demanded different things and 2. evolved in different cultures. Islam demanded a total adherence to rule of allah and of his chosen rulers on pain of death.

The same thing had been happening to the Spanish Empire as Spain had fallen far behind when it came to France & G.B. whose industrialization took decades. The major area the Ottoman empire was industrialized at was burned down in the great fire of Smyrna. It more comes down to the Ottoman empire not believing they were falling behind, they had an unwillingness to accept what was happening to them. It finally became apparent throughout the empire when Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798. At that time the Hejaz was nothing more than a tourist attraction, the Ottoman conflicts with Persia from the 16th to 18th century was much more than a sunni and shia conflict and that greatly helped nations states like Greece (with the help of France, G.B. and Russia) gain their freedom from the Ottoman empire and finally most of the people in geographical Syria and Egypt consisted of pre-industrial cities etc.\n\nI dont see how religion had much of anything to do with the development of either side when it comes to the discussion of 'modern nation states', it mostly has to do with the Ottomans not believing they had fallen behind in the 18th century..

In the Byzantine Empire, the Emperor had a lot of control over the Patriarch, and in its region of influence (such as Russia and Armenia) the Church and the State were closely connected.

Most european nations became more successful economically as most Islamic countries went into decline as time went on. \n\nOn the issue of secularism. It's hard to say. Does secularism lead to success? Today it would appear so. But what is secularism?  The Romans were pagans and were both religious and successful. Zoroastrianism helped make the Persians very successful in the ancient middle east.

There is evidence suggesting that the faith even reached Britain by the end of the first century via converted soldiers.\n\"Christianity's survival depended on the authority of the Roman empire\" I would refute. After all, it was during their greatest persecution that it spread most of all. When persecuted by Caesars (notably, Nero) it spread from Jerusalem to cover the whole of the Med and Asia Minor relatively quickly. It was clearly able to survive independently of the empire as it outlasted it and thrived whether favoured or opposed by it.\n\n\"Give to Caesar what is Caesars etc\" was a phrase coined decades before Christianity was known as an independent faith. Also, it was regarding devotion of property to rightful owner i.e taxes to Caesar and the whole self to God. Rather than a negotiation motto, it was a religious command to devote oneself to God as priority.\n\nI like very much your observation of Islam as an all encompassing religion with strong political motifs. As you say, it was as political and governing as it was spiritual from the get go.\n\nIMHO, Christianity and Islam evolved differently because 1. they demanded different things and 2. evolved in different cultures. Islam demanded a total adherence to rule of allah and of his chosen rulers on pain of death.

Soldiers now have to be alert at ALL times because they never know when the next barrage or air strike will be coming.

Her work in the agency was a day-to-day progression. She started as one of the women who worked on problems assigned from the engineers in what was then the Guidance and Control Branch. As Johnson worked on the problems, she would ask questions. She didn\u2019t want to just do the work -- she wanted to know the \u201chows\u201d and the \u201cwhys\u201d and then the \u201cwhy nots.\u201d None of the other women had ever asked questions before, but by asking questions, Johnson began to stand out. She was told that women didn\u2019t participate in the briefings or attend meetings; she asked if there were a law against it. The answer, of course, was no, and so Johnson began to attend briefings. NACA was just beginning its work on space. Space itself may be perceived as a series of plane surfaces, and as Johnson became known for her training in geometry, she began to work with the team more and more. Eventually, she became known as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her. She remembers quite clearly her experience at the time. \u201cThe women did what they were told to do,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask questions or take the task any further.

Then in 1962, President John F. Kennedy charged the country to send a man to the moon. Johnson became part of the team, and she began to work on calculating the trajectory for America\u2019s first space trip with Alan Shepherd\u2019s 1961 mission, an early step toward a moon landing.

Her work in the agency was a day-to-day progression. She started as one of the women who worked on problems assigned from the engineers in what was then the Guidance and Control Branch. As Johnson worked on the problems, she would ask questions. She didn\u2019t want to just do the work -- she wanted to know the \u201chows\u201d and the \u201cwhys\u201d and then the \u201cwhy nots.\u201d None of the other women had ever asked questions before, but by asking questions, Johnson began to stand out. She was told that women didn\u2019t participate in the briefings or attend meetings; she asked if there were a law against it. The answer, of course, was no, and so Johnson began to attend briefings. NACA was just beginning its work on space. Space itself may be perceived as a series of plane surfaces, and as Johnson became known for her training in geometry, she began to work with the team more and more. Eventually, she became known as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her. She remembers quite clearly her experience at the time. \u201cThe women did what they were told to do,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask questions or take the task any further. I asked questions; I wanted to know why. They got used to me asking questions and being the only woman there.\u201d It was this inquisitive nature that made her a valuable resource to the team and the only woman at the time to ever be pulled from the computing pool to work on other programs. Then in 1962, President John F. Kennedy charged the country to send a man to the moon. Johnson became part of the team, and she began to work on calculating the trajectory for America\u2019s first space trip with Alan Shepherd\u2019s 1961 mission, an early step toward a moon landing.

Putin is very careful not to say anything offensive about Islam while making these moves, he avoids running his mouth off and carries out his agenda by strengthening Sufis and pitting them off against \"Wahhabis\" and allowing more Mosques in Tatarstan to fulfill his goals. He doesn't want to set off religious anger while at the same time consolidating control. Putin sought to deepen the divide between Sufis and \"Wahhabis\", make Sufis depend on Russian state funding and funded the \"Chechen Congress\" in Grozny which essentially did Takfir on \"Wahhabis\". Putin supports loudmouth racist people in other countries but can't do the same in his own because there are 20 million Muslims in Russia, and he knows he would commit national suicide if he did the same. Russia would be in a civil war.\n\nChechnya couldn't have stopped the invasion of Dagestan because of all the foreign mujahideen bands roving around. Once the foreign Arab Mujahideen fighters like Khattab were in Chechnya, they claimed the right to stay by participating in the First Chechen war. It was just a matter of time before the foreign fighters blew it by fantasizing about global jihad and taking it to Dagestan. The mujahideen wanted to unite all Muslim areas under Islamic rule. Khattab and all the foreign mujahideen would have had to drop dead for any incident not to occur. The invasion of Dagestan was led by Khattab.\n\nKhattab fought in Afghanistan and in Tajikistan against the Russian government.

You didn't just attack them outright, generally. You needed a damn good reason that most other nations would agree with so that you could come out of it with your prestige intact and without risking a bunch of other nations ganging up on you (see: coalitions). So, basically other nations needed a good reason to get involved. The Union argued the whole war that it was an insurrection, an internal affair in which other nations had no business. The Confederates argued that they were a nation fighting for independence. This was tenuous at the beginning, while the Union either did nothing or lost battles. But, Europe did a lot of \"wait and see\" to keep their options open for long enough that by the time the war developed, the Union made a case for holding their own. The CS could never quite capitalize enough militarily to convince Europe that they stood a chance. \n\nWhen war broke out, Britain and France did little to stop trade with the Confederates and both protested the blockade once the Union declared it some ways into the war. If, as President Lincoln maintained, the war was an insurrection then he should have ordered the ports closed. Blockades were only declared against a warring nation.

Any movement against the Union during their fight was a movement in favor of the slaveholding Confederates. The war came on in a world where Britain had taken the lead in ending the African slave trade. This was murky early in the war, when the Union wasn't totally anti-slave. Once the Emancipation Proclamation was made and the war took a turn for the righteous, it became harder to justify intervening for the South if you were a morally upright nation.

Secretary of State Steward wanted to go to war over it believing that a war with Britain would reunited the North and South.    Lincoln would have none of it and told Seward, \"One war at a time.\"   Here, it was the US Secretary of State, not a foreign nation, that wanted war.\n\n", "id": "d1rgq1l"}]]], "58exmz": ["Can anyone tell me who this is?", "2016-10-20 08:08:51", 67, "https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/58exmz/can_anyone_tell_me_who_this_is/", [[1, "Reminder that this is a serious place for serious answers.

Did you know that soldiers often sharpened their entrenching shovels to use as weapons? That's metal as fuck.\n\nYou're exaggerating pretty heavily here. For one thing it wasn't 'years in the trenches,' fighting was quite mobile on the Eastern Front and in Palestine, as well as in Europe in 1914 and 1918, while trench warfare had all but broken down by late 1916. Attacks were nowhere near as suicidal as you suggest with \"tens of thousands\" cut down as they left the trenches. Sharpened spades were used for cqb in Stalingrad in WWII, so that's hardly unique to the First World War either. And last I checked, war itself is horrific; WWII, the Thirty and Eighty Years Wars, the Mongol Invasions, and probably a few more could match the destructiveness and horror of WWI within their own context. \n\n> The scene was so harrowing because of how intense it was, and how helpless the soliders were as bullets rained down. It was like that every battle in WW1. Soldiers would fix bayonets, the whistle would blow, and they'd go over the top, only to be mowed down. Entire regiments disappeared in the hail of bullets. Every battle in WW1 was D-Day.\n\nAnd more sensationalism. D-Day wasn't **everyday** in WWI, the attackers possessed their own formidable firepower and developed sophisticated tactics that allowed them to overcome entrenched positions. In fact, as a result of the near collapse the Germans had faced in September, 1916, the German Army's defensive tactics shifted **away** from static trenchlines, to a more fluid defense in depth based around shell hole defences, pillboxes, bunkers and obstacle belts. \n\n> I don't want a movie that includes the First World War, I want a movie about the First World War-- the intensity, futility, and horror of the whole thing. Why the fuck would you even spend so much money building a set to show five minutes of trench warfare, only to cut back to whatever bullshit love story we're supposed to be following?\n\n> There are a few movies that are really about the war. The Lost Battalion was excellent. Historically accurate and criminally underrated. Beneath Hill 60 was fantastic as well, and the best part was the soldiers were actually dirty. They were just caked in mud and looked exhausted and pissed. You really get a glimpse at how much it sucked to be in the trenches. I also quite enjoyed Gallipoli, though it was a broader story centered on the loss of Australia's innocence. And who can forget the classic All Quiet on the Western Front, though it's become rather dated and the 1979 remake failed dramatically to live up to the original film.\n\nThe issue with all of this is that A) including a home front connection is important to allow the audience to connect with people who, like them, are not be soldiers. It would also work against this recurring belief that people on the home front didn't have a clue what the war was like or about, despite ample research by social historians of the war demonstrating the falseness of this. \n\nAbove all, all these movies really do is emphasize the perceived futility of the conflict. I've yet to see a film about WWI that depicts an attack that succeeded; or that portrays commanders as anything other than completely spineless cowards, or nincompoops, or both; or that gives the impression that the people involved in fighting or working or whatever they may be doing, actually believe that they are part of something meaningful or worthwhile. *Beneath Hill 60* is a great film, but while the mines detonate successfully, it isn't really driven home (largely I think due to an understandable focus on the Aussies)  how much of a success the subsequent Battle of Messines Ridge was, or just how far the British Army had come at that point in conducting attacks. *War Horse* gives a hopelessly stereotypical depiction of cavalry in the First World War as useless and obsolete, ignoring the real utility it possessed and the success it enjoyed in 1914 and throughout the war, while it's depiction of the Somme in July 1918 is again, hopelessly stereotypical, esp. considering that July 1918 saw the beginning of the successful Hundred Days Offensives that were to end the war on the Western Front in an Allied victory. I have yet to see *The Lost Battalion* (I have it on dvd though), but I'd hope it gives some sense of the context of the event, ie it took place during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, not the proudest moment in American military history, but a part of the Hundred Days. \n\nMost of the WWI films I've seen focus entirely on the Western Front, *Lawrence of Arabia* being the honourable exception, and they simply rehash the same tropes of 'mud, blood and futility,' and re-serve the same characterizations, in the same setting. I'll agree with the commenters below that WWII is more easily romanticized than WWI, that it makes for an easier narrative. While I don't think that 'neither side was bad' in WWI, I think a strong case can be made for the Entente/Allies, I'd rather not see big WWI films made if they **are** going to dumb down the war like that. I'm also not asking for a white-washing of the horrors that men faced, but Alexander Watson (in his recent work *Enduring the Great War*) makes the important point that endurance and resilience were the name of the game; without that the war could not possibly have gone on for as long as it did, and the same could be said for WWII. \n\nThe big issue I'd say is that to make a WWI film, at least as I've outlined, would be a complex process. With the example of films like *Fury*, I think that such a treatment for WWI is possible, but not likely. The familiar quiver of tropes and clich\u00e9s is far easier to work with at this point.

So with WW2, Hitler and the Nazi's are regarded as the worst evil that has ever existed.  As time goes by though, that ascription tends to fade away, and you're left with only an aggressor and a victim.  What ancient armies did to conquered cities back in the day was unbelievably awful.  \nDan Carlin also points out that it takes a hell of a lot more resolve and brutality to gore someone to death than it does to shoot them from a distance.  In that regards, WW1 was a lot more impersonal on a lot more massive scale than a lot of wars certainly before the late 19th century.

If you're having trouble finding sources, get at least one recent source and look at the author's footnotes and/or bibliography.

THe question I asked was just a question that I stumpled upon while doing research for my actual paper topic which is called \"The Great Western Schism and the universities of Paris, Prague and Vienna\".

As I live in a German speaking country, the sources my vary, though I have one in English called \"A companion to the Great Western Schism\" by Joelle Roller Coster.\n\nI am still unsure about my research focus. The paper should be around 16 pages long. I have an appointement with my professor in the upcoming days and we'll talk about the focus of the paper.\n\nAs of now, I think it would be a good idea if I focus on the consequences of the schism upon the universities. How did the pope deal with universities in general? How did it change after the schism? What did the universities do during the schism? Were the universities dependant on the pope?\n\nDo you think this is the right direction?", "id": "czsou2i"}, {"comment": "Great, meeting with your professor is probably the most important thing you're doing, since they will be the one marking your paper. \n\nAsk yourself why you selected those particular universities. Paris, Prague, and Vienna are spread out. If you're trying to talk about broad responses and impacts, this approach will work, but you are forcing yourself to contextualize both medieval France and the Holy Roman Empire. For a 16 page paper, I would suggest picking one or the other. For example, I would probably replace the University of Paris with another institution founded in the area of the Holy Roman Empire such as the University of Heidelberg or the University Bologna. If you choose three universities that have (broadly) similar cultural backgrounds, you can more readily focus your research and go more in-depth on the topic. \n\nLuckily for you, the Germans have great primary source collections, organized and assembled in good German fashion. Your professor will no doubt have a bunch of places for you to look, but here are some others in the meantime:\n\n1.

(Monumenta Germanica Historica)[http://www.dmgh.de], one of the best collections of medieval documents we have, finally searchable.\n\nThe hardest part is going to be finding primary sources that talk directly about the Schism. I would assemble a list of key terms to keep an eye out for such as Avignon, Gregory XI, and Clement VII. \n\nAs for methodology, if you haven't done so already start reading some of the stuff by Otto Brunner, Gerd Althoff, and Karl Schmid.

Conflicts started when the Muslims were kicked out of Mecca, and had all their property taken from them by the Meccans. Most Muslims traveled medina (called yathrib at the time). Medina was shared by 4 tribes, who were constantly at each other's throats. 2 were Jewish, 2 were pagan. Muhammad became a mediator of the tribes, and along with the leaders of he tribes, Muhammad created a charter/constitution that all 4 tribes and the Muslims must follow in medina. \n\nWhen news reached the Muslims that the Meccans were selling all the property of the Muslims, Muhammad told the Muslims the raid the caravans of the Meccans. \n\nThis provoked the Meccans to wage war on the Muslims, with the goal of extermination. They openly made this their claim, and all called on their alliances to join them. The war became the the Muslims and the tribes of medina vs the Meccans and their coalition (which were far more powerful). \n\nThe Meccans laid seige to medina, and long sorry short, they failed. Muhammad eventually conquered Mecca and subdued the tribes allied with the Meccans, and the Muslims became the dominant faction in Arabia. \n\nThis is a shorthand of the events, but even so, the events don't color anyone as a warlord in this scenario.  Not even the Meccans, who were simply worried about losing political power and felt threatened by the Muslims. \n\nWarlord is a bias term. Especially in the modern age. You might say you mean no offense, but there is offense implied in the term. Warlord implies Muhammad's goals and actions were to wage war and steal as much wealth and power as possible.

The same way Obama or Churchill would technically be considered warlords. Muhammad was bringing a message of social and religious reform,make was put into a political position. \n\nPolitics involves war. \n\nThe term warlord implies that Muhammad went around starting wars for personal gain, when all records show, even at the height of the power of the Muslims during his life, he lived very humbly, and had all of his property dispersed throughout the Muslim community when he died (his property did not go to his family, who ended up relatively poor after his death). \n\nHe was he leader of a group of people who were thrust into war. Conflicts started when the Muslims were kicked out of Mecca, and had all their property taken from them by the Meccans. Most Muslims traveled medina (called yathrib at the time). Medina was shared by 4 tribes, who were constantly at each other's throats. 2 were Jewish, 2 were pagan. Muhammad became a mediator of the tribes, and along with the leaders of he tribes, Muhammad created a charter/constitution that all 4 tribes and the Muslims must follow in medina. \n\nWhen news reached the Muslims that the Meccans were selling all the property of the Muslims, Muhammad told the Muslims the raid the caravans of the Meccans. \n\nThis provoked the Meccans to wage war on the Muslims, with the goal of extermination. They openly made this their claim, and all called on their alliances to join them. The war became the the Muslims and the tribes of medina vs the Meccans and their coalition (which were far more powerful). \n\nThe Meccans laid seige to medina, and long sorry short, they failed. Muhammad eventually conquered Mecca and subdued the tribes allied with the Meccans, and the Muslims became the dominant faction in Arabia. \n\nThis is a shorthand of the events, but even so, the events don't color anyone as a warlord in this scenario.  Not even the Meccans, who were simply worried about losing political power and felt threatened by the Muslims. \n\nWarlord is a bias term. Especially in the modern age. You might say you mean no offense, but there is offense implied in the term. Warlord implies Muhammad's goals and actions were to wage war and steal as much wealth and power as possible. Which is not the case at all, and war was actually a short amount of time in the life of Muhammad after he received his revelations.

I misinterpreted your comment that cynical realism isn't good for our generation as saying that more idealism would be good for us.\n\nHowever, I don't think you're considering a broad enough context. Cynicism can be well-placed if you grow up in a lower economic class and don't have good educational access, but it can also be a problem because it will cause some to ignore the realistic opportunities that are available.\n\nI'm referring mostly to the context that has access to college education but needs to take on debt to attend. These are the kids who have access to the option of pursuing a history degree. I think in this group the problem is a lack of cynicism and an abundance of idealism. Many kids in this group have some level of awareness of the difficult economic conditions for college graduates in our generation, but are idealistic enough to convince themselves that they will be the exception to the rule. In this case the cynicism hits too late, when they have a degree but can't get a good enough job to comfortably pay off their debt and afford the same quality of life as their parents and peers. Some may be even worse off than they would have been if they'd entered the workforce straight out of college.\n\nThis group absolutely does have the ability to achieve their goals, but too many are ignorant of the economic realities and go all out to achieve them in college. In reality, it's better to get a useful degree that can provide the economic stability and work-life balance necessary to pursue those goals later in life.", "id": "d3qu747"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d3quz9n"}, {"comment": "But every degree does this.

The rest of it is spent in the library picking up books about your research - those are almost never prescribed by the professor.

Pick poor source materials or use too few sources and you'll hear about it from your professors.\n\nThis history \"told by the winners\" meme is true but is getting abused in the post-modern world.  Something like Caesar's accounts of his campaign against the Gauls is obviously biased and no serious scholar in history would try to tell you otherwise.  Some of it can be verified by archaeology or other sources - the discipline in general and the sources aren't viewed in isolation.  It's not fully possible to remove bias totally, but by doing things like triangulating sources you can land on something approximating truth.  I honestly don't think one could get a degree in History using blatantly biased sources.  My history papers were always reviewed by published historians who had been awarded legitimate Phd's - these aren't easy credentials to obtain. \n\nI'm also not sure this principal of history being told by winners applies to any modern conflict which involves literate participants - do we have any shortage of books about the Confederacy in the American Civil War or the Nazis in World War 2?  Also there are fair amount of agreed upon facts pertaining to every event (ie: nobody really disputes when and where the Normandy invasion was, what units were involved, or the outcome of the battles).  So dismissing History as being \"told by the winners\" is intellectually lazy.\n\nI didn't study STEM much at the University level, but I do have a  Diploma in CIS and worked in Corporate IT consulting with some technologies you have used for companies you've heard of.

"], [2, "Like some of the other posters have suggested, your brother may find that something in library/information science (such as archives) or work as a contract or independent researcher or writer suits him. And, as at least one other person has pointed out, you don't necessarily need to stay in-field to make money with a history degree.\n\nI am an archivist. Archives may well be a good fit for your brother. I do not want to discourage him from pursuing a career in archives if that's something he's interested in. However, I would encourage him to consider the following:\n\nArchives exist so people can use them. The stereotype of the dust-covered archivist shielding himself from the world behind a wall of paper in storage room otherwise devoid of human life becomes less true every year. Archives need to attract users and funding to survive, and doing that requires archives (although not every individual archivist) to reach out. There are a lot of jobs in archives that require limited contact with other people, but not as many as one might think. It would definitely not be safe to assume that an archival career would be a sure way to minimize contact with people.\n\nSmall and medium-size archives may employ only one or a few staff, most or all of whom will need to have some interaction with each other and non-archivists (creators/donors of material, researchers, students, administrators, funders, colleagues at other institutions) on at least a semi-regular basis. Some medium-size archives and most if not all large archives do employ people in pretty focused positions. However, employees do still need to be able to communicate with each other, of course (how much and how often depends on the organizational structure and culture of the archives). Employees whose jobs generally deal with the \"behind the scenes\" aspects of archives may still need to interact with people outside the department from time-to-time. Examples of this include covering a shift in the reading room (where materials are made available to researchers) when the people who normally do it can't for some reason, an unexpected visit from a donor when the people who usually talk to donors aren't around, or the need to work with developers employed by a vendor or consortium to resolve a software issue. Many larger archives are also affiliated with universities, which sometimes (although not always) require teaching and/or service (committee work) from their professional faculty.\n\nRegardless of the position one starts in, it seems unlikely to me that one could go very far up the career ladder without regularly interacting with people, unless perhaps one had such incredibly outstanding IT skills that one could justify a relatively high salary without supervising students and/or staff, building positive and fruitful relationships with donors, and/or successfully lobbying administrators for funding. Of course, this would only be an issue if one wanted to climb the ladder - a lot of people are pretty happy with the amount of responsibility and remuneration they get on the lower rungs and spend their careers there, which is fine.\n\nAs another poster pointed out, digitization is a very common activity in the archival world now, but only at the smaller archives is it something the archivist himself would be likely to engage in on a regular basis (along with a variety of other tasks, in my observation). At larger institutions, the archivist(s) would probably design the digitization program and may do some of the work, but most of it would likely be delegated to paraprofessionals or student workers.\n\nI'm in the US. Your spelling suggests that you aren't, and of course, things may be different where you are. However, I suspect the situation is broadly similar elsewhere, at least in other Western countries. If your brother's interested in archives and any of what I mentioned above concerns him, I would encourage him to do some additional research in those areas.\n\nBeyond digitization, some major types of activities that archivists engage in include appraising and acquiring archival materials, arranging and describing paper, photographic, AV, and electronic records so that users (internal users and/or external researchers) can find and access relevant material, helping researchers find relevant materials and use those materials without damaging them, performing preservation activities to help insure records' longevity, perhaps performing some more intensive conservation activities on particular items, creating digital and/or physical exhibits of materials, educating students and others about collection contents and working with archival materials (this can be formal or informal), and working with creators/donors to obtain high-quality research collections.\n\nAgain, I'm not writing all of this to try to dissuade your brother from considering archives as a career, I just want to suggest that, while there probably are a lot of positions in the archival field that would meet his criteria, there may not be as many as he thinks and he should do some serious research before investing in a graduate degree that focuses on archival work.\n\nIf he would like to learn more about the field, I suggest that he start by looking at the website for your country's main professional organization for archivists. I will list a few at the end of this post; if yours isn't among them, a Google search will probably do the trick. Hopefully the relevant website will have some more information on archival work, archival education, and the career outlook for archivists and similar professions in your country. If he would like to learn more about archives than what's provided online, I would suggest that he locate the contact information of an archivist at a university, government archives, library, or museum  in your area and contact them to request an informational interview about what they do and how archives might fit with his educational background and career goals. If it's possible, he might also consider volunteering or seeking employment as a paraprofessional (a position that does not require someone to hold an MLIS or comparable degree or to have previous experience doing archival work (at least in some cases)) at an archives in order to get a taste of what the work is like. Contacting an archives professor at an accredited graduate program in library, information, or archival science may also be a useful way to obtain information about archives as a career, as well as about that program's specific requirements, graduate employment rates, etc.\n\nOther library and information science careers that tend to require relatively little human contact (as far as I know) are cataloging and conservation. I don't know much about those, but contacting people who actually work in those fields would be a fast track to enlightenment. Rare book librarianship is another option your brother might want to consider, although I suspect that the level of interpersonal contact required is similar to, if not higher than, what it generally is for archives.\n\nA lot of people are hesitant to \"cold call\" (or email) strangers to ask about their work, but archivists and librarians are generally a welcoming and helpful bunch, and a lot (A LOT) of us are introverts to some degree and were once recent history grads who had no idea what we wanted to do and only found out by seeking out the information we wanted and trying the work out.\n\nBest of luck to your brother! :)\n\nSelected national/international archival associations:\n\n*[Association of Canadian Archivists] (http://archivists.ca/)\n*[Archives and Records Association (UK & Ireland)] (http://www.archives.org.uk/about.html)\n*[Australian Society of Archivists] (https://www.archivists.org.au/)\n*[Archives and Records Association of New Zealand] (http://www.aranz.org.nz/)\n*[Society of American Archivists] (http://archivists.org)\n*[International Council on Archives] (http://www.ica.org/3/homepage/home.html)\n\nedit: formatting, spelling\n\n\n\n\n"], [1, "He could become an author.

At larger institutions, the archivist(s) would probably design the digitization program and may do some of the work, but most of it would likely be delegated to paraprofessionals or student workers.\n\nI'm in the US. Your spelling suggests that you aren't, and of course, things may be different where you are. However, I suspect the situation is broadly similar elsewhere, at least in other Western countries. If your brother's interested in archives and any of what I mentioned above concerns him, I would encourage him to do some additional research in those areas.\n\nBeyond digitization, some major types of activities that archivists engage in include appraising and acquiring archival materials, arranging and describing paper, photographic, AV, and electronic records so that users (internal users and/or external researchers) can find and access relevant material, helping researchers find relevant materials and use those materials without damaging them, performing preservation activities to help insure records' longevity, perhaps performing some more intensive conservation activities on particular items, creating digital and/or physical exhibits of materials, educating students and others about collection contents and working with archival materials (this can be formal or informal), and working with creators/donors to obtain high-quality research collections.\n\nAgain, I'm not writing all of this to try to dissuade your brother from considering archives as a career, I just want to suggest that, while there probably are a lot of positions in the archival field that would meet his criteria, there may not be as many as he thinks and he should do some serious research before investing in a graduate degree that focuses on archival work.\n\nIf he would like to learn more about the field, I suggest that he start by looking at the website for your country's main professional organization for archivists. I will list a few at the end of this post; if yours isn't among them, a Google search will probably do the trick. Hopefully the relevant website will have some more information on archival work, archival education, and the career outlook for archivists and similar professions in your country. If he would like to learn more about archives than what's provided online, I would suggest that he locate the contact information of an archivist at a university, government archives, library, or museum  in your area and contact them to request an informational interview about what they do and how archives might fit with his educational background and career goals. If it's possible, he might also consider volunteering or seeking employment as a paraprofessional (a position that does not require someone to hold an MLIS or comparable degree or to have previous experience doing archival work (at least in some cases)) at an archives in order to get a taste of what the work is like. Contacting an archives professor at an accredited graduate program in library, information, or archival science may also be a useful way to obtain information about archives as a career, as well as about that program's specific requirements, graduate employment rates, etc.\n\nOther library and information science careers that tend to require relatively little human contact (as far as I know) are cataloging and conservation. I don't know much about those, but contacting people who actually work in those fields would be a fast track to enlightenment. Rare book librarianship is another option your brother might want to consider, although I suspect that the level of interpersonal contact required is similar to, if not higher than, what it generally is for archives.\n\nA lot of people are hesitant to \"cold call\" (or email) strangers to ask about their work, but archivists and librarians are generally a welcoming and helpful bunch, and a lot (A LOT) of us are introverts to some degree and were once recent history grads who had no idea what we wanted to do and only found out by seeking out the information we wanted and trying the work out.\n\nBest of luck to your brother! :)\n\nSelected national/international archival associations:\n\n*[Association of Canadian Archivists] (http://archivists.ca/)\n*[Archives and Records Association (UK & Ireland)] (http://www.archives.org.uk/about.html)\n*[Australian Society of Archivists] (https://www.archivists.org.au/)\n*[Archives and Records Association of New Zealand] (http://www.aranz.org.nz/)\n*[Society of American Archivists] (http://archivists.org)\n*[International Council on Archives] (http://www.ica.org/3/homepage/home.html)\n\nedit: formatting, spelling\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "cyn7mla"}, {"comment": "This is a wonderful post.

Can you define what you mean by history a little bit clearer? \n\nI'm not sure I'd characterize Judges and Kings as a simple chronological account, but I might just be missing what you mean. There are some old Sanskrit or Prakrit historical accounts and they often have themes. But they're heavily filtered through a religious context (often Buddhist). \n\nEdit: I should clarify. Are the Puranas history? How about the Riveda?

Herodotus may have mentioned the gods in passing, but he did not provide genealogies of the gods like the Puranas, which make them religious texts if anything. Whereas the Puranas are primarily concerned with documenting folklore along with theological and philosophical tracts, Herodotus' *Histories* is basically an account of the expansion of the Achaemenid Persian Empire and its wars with the Greek city-states of the time. Do you see the difference? \n\nI did not bother to explain the difference between chronicles and actual histories in my OP, but perhaps I should, if it's not clear to some people. A chronicle basically lists and tersely describes events in a strict chronological order, without any introspection, analysis, or attempt to form a coherent narrative that actually explains the events and people described, comparing them to others, etc. I mean, simply take a work of history like that written by the ancient Greek Polybius, the ancient Roman Livy, or the 18th-century Englishman Edward Gibbon, and just compare it to the works of medieval chroniclers like Giovanni Villani, Matthew Paris, or Froissart. The difference is like night and day. The same goes for ancient chronicles as written in ancient Egypt, Babylonia, or Assyria.

It's true that they mention some of the contemporary Hellenistic kingdoms that had trade and diplomatic contacts with the Mauryan Empire of India at the time, but the edicts do not go about describing this history. The edicts' central role was to propagate Buddhism and proper moral precepts to the people, as sponsored and sanctioned by their monarch who erected these impressive religious monuments. That's essentially what they are, Buddhist monuments and propaganda extolling the virues of the monarch and how his people should live according to Buddhist scripture.

To sum it up, chronicles only speak of events as they happen year after year, without providing any overarching context or narrative or analysis of comparative events, people, or concepts. Histories, on the other hand, can focus on sweeping historical changes, the evolution of social groups, the rise and fall of powerful families, the role and importance of certain governmental offices over time, the impact of music or poetry on society and culture over time, the consequence of military reforms on later events, etc. There is no chronicle in existence that offers any sort of comprehensive social view of what happened in the past, unlike histories. Even strictly political histories, the most common form before the modern era, are not shackled and restrained by the linear chronological format and can jump from one era to another to explain and contextualize a whole series of events. Meanwhile, a chronicle will just say \"so and so did this and this, okay, moving on, another guy did this and said this, and people responded as such. Then, a month later, the king went hunting and killed six boars. Two months later, a strong storm destroyed a temple in the capital city. The invading army of [insert any enemy you like here] besieged the capital on the third day of the seventh month. The enemy was defeated. Shortly afterwards, his son married so and so and had a boy, the future heir.\" Etc. Etc. Etc.\n\n>Herodotus loved taking the historical tale he heard that best told the moral lesson he wanted to convey (see: the death of Cyrus the Great). The Indian and Hebrew tales are more explicitly an interpretation of history that is designed to teach a moral tale, but they're different methods to reach the same conclusion. \n\nYou're really stuck on Herodotus whereas you should pay heed to the Greek historians who came after him, who were far more professional on average when it came to avoiding lively tales and pedagogical moral anecdotes. Medieval chronicles certainly contained these, especially if they promoted chivalric virtues. Think of Froissart's chronicles as a prime example of that, although Froissart and his contemporaries almost never strayed from the chronicle format established by the Christian bishop and chronicler Eusebius in the 4th century. Comparing this to the Greco-Roman historiographical tradition, even when the Roman historian Livy admits in the beginning of his work that his history should serve as a lesson of what nasty things we should avoid and how best to act as a people and a nation, he still delivers a cohesive narrative and not one that is strictly, rigidly chronological like you'd see in a chronicle. In sum, you can glean moral or pedagogical lessons from chronicles and histories alike; that does not mean they belong in the same category.\n\n>Even the first Chinese histories of the Zhou Dynasty are just an attempt to justify taking power from the Shang (the Xia are either not real or were re-characterized to fit the narrative).\n\nSee, now you're mixing up the earlier Chinese tradition of chronicle writing (such as the *Spring and Autumn Annals* composed during the Western Zhou and Warring States period, 5th century BC) with the later legitimate historiographical tradition established by Sima Qian at the end of the 2nd century BC. Sima is rather unique in this regard even, considering how his work wasn't used to justify the ending of one dynasty in favor of another, and was very critical of the current reigning monarch Emperor Wu of Han (perhaps rightly so, considering how he made Sima Qian into a eunuch). \n\nIt is true that the official Chinese dynastic histories (excluding Sima Qian's work) and universal histories advocated the concept of the Mandate of Heaven, that the cosmos ordained the fall of one dynasty and the rise of another, and were essentially mouthpieces for the current dynastic family and government in charge. These are perhaps their biggest failings as true historiographical works, yet despite that they are not just some strict chronological works like the previous chronicles of the Zhou Dynasty and Warring States Period. Take the *Shiji* for example, a work that includes various episodes and weaves them together to describe certain overarching themes and topics, and excludes them from other chapters that take a purely biographical approach to describing people. You would never see that sort of division and compartmentalization in a chronicle, because the job of a chronicle is to simply list the events of what happened year after year after year, sometimes providing rich descriptions in those passages. Yet these chronicles never stray from the format of describing things as they happen in a subsequent, annual, linear progression. The *Shiji* offers us completely seperate treatises on the histories of hereditary houses, the history of music, the history of calendrical science, the history of astronomy in China, the history of sacrificial offerings, the history of economics and financial administration.

Even Sima Qian's *Shiji* contained some annalistic style chapters, the *Basic Annals* (B\u011bnj\u00ec \u672c\u7d00). As the Japanese historiographical tradition matured it represented more or less the same literary achievements made by the Chinese dynastic histories in terms of complexity and arrangement.\n\nAs for the Hebrew Bible's Book of Kings and Buddhist texts about Ashoka, I'm not sure how you think these contain historical narratives that accommodate the same arrangement of topics and themes of real histories. I know that I overuse him, but take Polybius for example. He explains to us how the Roman army was so successful, not only when and where they were victorious in battle and who their commanders were at the time, but also the tactics they used, the armor, gear, and equipment they had, and the organization of their troops into cohorts and maniples. Then he compared them to how Greek style warfare existed in the same time frame. You won't find anything like that in a chronicle, let alone the Bible.

What are the commentaries on the S&A Annals? They're not a chronology.

Although his commentary, unlike the other two for the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (*Gongyang* and *Guliang*), provides helpful background information to the events described in the annals, it nevertheless by default follows those events in their original chronological order. I will grant Zuo that he revealed a rich amount of cultural ideas that were otherwise nonexistent in the text that flesh out a nice picture of society at the time, but his commentary is nothing like the *Shiji* in terms of arrangement and narrow focus on various topics in their own right that possess their own treatises. Zuo never did anything like relate to us the concise history and nature of pitch pipes in China, something Sima was eager to tell us.

He was clearly influenced by Herodotus an Thucydides and used their historical works as his models for retelling Egyptian history in a coherent historical narrative. Before Manetho, the native Egyptians simply wrote chronological annals and kings lists. Those are not the same things as actual histories.

They were in charge of documenting the reigns of pharoahs, and recording agricultural output. While the perspective is based on the elites.

There's still movies coming about WWII, but also big-budget video games, TV series, and the eternal Hitler Channel.\n\nA lot of pop history material about WWII doesn't really cover the facets of the war that really interest scholars. Stuff that goes over well-understood operations like El Alamein or Omaha Beach is trivial to current research. Probably worse are all the people obsessed with equipment data, with no regard given to the actual use or relevance of said equipment to the war. At the lowest rung of popular history are all the conspiracy theories and alt-history scenarios. \n\nNone of that stuff resembles the work of actual working historians, who try to research/publish stuff that will actually be relevant to somebody.

The British weren't wealthy enough or powerful enough to fight both the French and Spanish across the entire world, so they eventually lost. \nDon't think that the French were particularly sympathetic to the American cause; Louis XVI, an autocrat, had little reason to support republicanism. A few French and Spanish nobles actually thought that the notion of an American revolution and republic was a convenient joke that allowed them to rid themselves of British power in the Americas. They were wrong on both accounts. In just a few decades, the only remaining colonial power in the Americas would be Britain, and they would go on to control a quarter of the world's population. As for republicanism, America has persisted until the present day, and will surely go on a while longer. Now, most of the world's regimes are republican in nature, many of their own revolutions and constitutions inspired by the United States. And it is indeed ironic that some Frenchmen viewed republics as a joke, for in just a few short years, they'd get a bloody, bloody taste of it.

One problem faced by those choosing targets for the bombs was that Japan was pretty much smashed to bits already."], [1, "First off, the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan) on the Surrender of Japan is above average in giving some background.\n\nMy personal reading on it is that they probably weren't *needed*, but we didn't know that at the time. Whether they were \"worth it\" is a separate question, though, and one that veers into speculation since we don't know what would happen in an alternate history where they weren't dropped.\n\nI don't think they were needed because the Japanese had already been searching for a way to get out of the war at that point. The leadership had been somewhat split, but starting in summer '45 they started to lean towards finding a way to end the war, including the Emperor. Their problem was that they were still being a bit unrealistic about their chances at this point. They wanted to get a negotiated peace so they could save a certain amount of face, and were split between asking the Russians to act as a mediator and trying to inflict heavy enough casualties on an American invasion to get better terms. They honestly were pretty close to accepting the Potsdam declaration, but the lack of guarantees for the Emperor were a sticking point. Guarantees we eventually gave to him anyway after their surrender.\n\nThe Japanese relationship with the USSR is absolutely critical at this point. They were *counting* on the USSR to act as a neutral mediator like the US had in the Russo-Japanese war four decades previous. They had already been sending feelers to Moscow, who had been playing dumb to buy time to reposition their forces to the east.\n\nThey received word that the USSR broke their nonaggression pact and invaded Manchuria the very same morning as the Nagasaki bomb. \n\nYou have to understand the difference in impact these two things had. Atomic bombs were poorly understood (especially the effects of radiation poisoning), their damage was still only at a level comparable to a firebombing campaign similar to what had already hit Tokyo, and Japanese experts were sure that the US couldn't have many. (And in truth we only had one more ready at the time)\n\nMeanwhile the invasion of the Russians was the cutting off of their last hope for a negotiated peace, as well as a significant threat on its own. Their forces in Manchuria just folded over, and all the defenses of the Japanese home islands had been concentrated in the South in preparation for an American attack. They were wide open from the Northwest, and some of their estimates put Soviet troops in Tokyo in a matter of weeks. While the surrender statement makes acknowledgement of the bombs, Japanese history books generally weigh the Soviet declaration of war as being a heavier factor.\n\nNot that the US at the time knew any of that. From the US perspective, the Japanese had developed a reputation for fighting to the last man, and committing suicide before surrender even among civilians. The Topography of Kyuushu also meant that the potential sites for an amphibious invasion were extremely limited, and each of those was likely to be heavily fortified. The invasion was set for October and was forecast to cast hundreds of thousands of lives. Bombing civilians was hardly a new or unique tactic at this point. If a new bomb could force an early end to the war it made sense to them.\n\nBut to go back to your original question, was it *worth it*, that's more difficult, and solidly in the realm of speculation. From everything I've read, I think there was a very good chance the Soviet's declaration of war could have forced a surrender on roughly the same timeframe. That implies the bombs and all the lives they took were wasted and didn't substantially accelerate the end of the war.\n\nBut if we're looking at this as a long term thing, you also have to look at them in the context of the cold war. We're going deeper into speculative territory here, so hold on.\n\nThe bombs were classified until their use, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki served to demonstrate their effect. If they weren't bombed, the US government may or may not have decided to release news of the Trinity test to the public, depending on if they valued the bomb's deterrent effect or status as a secret weapon more. Either way, it wouldn't have stopped the USSR's 1948 development, since they had lots of intel from spies in the Manhattan project.\n\nBut whatever happened, one sure thing is that the destructive potential of Atomic bombs wouldn't have been communicated to the global public as surely as it was with pictures and stories from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And in that context, it means that the reluctance to use Nukes we saw in the Korean and Cold wars might not be so high as it was in reality. And *that's* terrifying enough to make me think they might have been worth it."], [1, "I haven't read all the comments so I might double-post. Here's my view, based on many different docs and literature, though I'm no expert.\n\nThe Americans requested the Russians to join the fight against Japan. The Japanese would've surrendered because they did not want to fight Russia (USSR) (in fear of being completely anhialated. The Americans however, did not want the Japanese to surrender to Russia instead of to themselves. The USA decided to drop the bombs before Russia could join the war, making the Japanese surrender to the Americans.\n\nI hope this is satisfaying.

It did a couple of things, first it brought about a quicker end to the war. The war was, by this time, really over for the Japanese. There was no hope of winning and I believe that it was well known by their leaders. What kept them going was the hubris that similarly kept the German leadership surrendering earlier than they did. The two bombs effectively overcame this pride.\n\nThe second \"value\" gained by using the atomic weaponry available to the U.S. was that it put on display for the Russians the fact that we truly had built these weapons and we would use them. The U.S. chose not to take on the Russians as Patton and others had advocated for. The Kremlin had to consider this when they thought about trying to push for greater control. \n\nIt did have other consequences as well. There were many lives both Japanese and Allied that were save by not engaging in a land invasion. By ending the conflict sooner the impact of Russia in the Far East was reduced. \n\nIt is truly hard to argue the worth of using these weapons. There were many positive outcomes but it also showcased the barbaric nature of the human animal. This was just one more act in a conflict filled with barbaric acts. \n\nThe use of these had a lingering non-military impact as well. It created a fear of the energy of the atom.

It would have caused a ton of American (and obviously Japanese) casualties - a lot more than the casualties from the bombing. Some people look at is as doing Japan a favor, because they think that there would have been more destruction if it was normal warfare - but that's not entirely true. Was it ethical? I don't think so. Was it necessary? Yes, if they wanted to win the war. "], [0, "I believe it was.

However with bias, they did save a lot of lives on the American side, and, depending on the amount of battles ought afterwards, could've saved some more Japanese lives as well, plus with Japan out of the way it was easier for America to focus on stopping Hitler and, the unknown at the time, Holocaust. Plus, the precedent set by the US using the bomb, showing its destruction, has prompted to never use a weapon like it for war since."], [-7, "For America, yes. Now, people keep saying that a land invasion would end up in disaster because Japanese people were very loyal, bla bla and would fight till the end but that's just nonsense.

And the Jew who committed suicide were just a fraction, most Jews surrendered to Alexander and later, the Romans. \n\nTwo hundred thousands, do you even count? Not even a full blow battle of titanic scale such as Battle of Bulge caused that much casualties. \n\nThe bombs did lower the casualties for America, help end the war quicker and also portray the power of nuclear bomb.

According to family legend, midway through the birth, the midwife wrung her hands and declared the lightning a bad omen. This child will be a child of darkness, she said, to which his mother replied: \u201cNo. He will be a child of light.\u201d\n\n2. HE WAS REALLY FUNNY\nMost people don\u2019t know that Tesla had a terrific sense of humor, Seifer said. For example, after dining with writer and poet Rudyard Kipling, he wrote this in a correspondence to a close friend:\n\nApril 1, 1901\n\nMy dear Mrs. Johnson,\nWhat is the matter with inkspiller Kipling? He actually dared to invite me to dine in an obscure hotel where I would be sure to get hair and cockroaches in the soup.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN. Tesla\n\n3. HE AND EDISON WERE RIVALS, BUT NOT SWORN ENEMIES\nMany have characterized Tesla and inventor Thomas Edison as enemies (see this and this,) but Carlson says this relationship has been misrepresented. Early in his career, Tesla worked for Edison, designing direct current generators, but famously quit to pursue his own project: the alternating current induction motor. Sure, they were on different sides of the so-called \u201cCurrent Wars,\u201d with Edison pushing for direct current and Tesla for alternating current. But Carlson considers them the Steve Jobs and Bill Gates of their time: one the brilliant marketer and businessman and the other a visionary and \u201ctech guy.\u201d\n\nOn a rare occasion, Edison attended a conference where Tesla was speaking. Edison, hard of hearing and not wanting to be spotted, slipped into the back of the auditorium to listen to the lecture. But Tesla spotted Edison in the crowd, called attention to him and led the audience in giving him a standing ovation.\n\nSeifer qualifies it more, saying the two had a love/hate relationship. At first Edison dismissed Tesla, but came to eventually respect him, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen there were fires at Tesla\u2019s laboratory, Edison provided him a lab, so clearly there was some mutual respect,\u201d Seifer said\n\n4. HE DEVELOPED THE IDEA FOR SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGY IN 1901\nTesla may have had a brilliant mind, but he was not as good at reducing his ideas to practice, Carlson said. In the race to develop transatlantic radio, Tesla described to his funder and business partner, J.P. Morgan, a new means of instant communication that involved gathering stock quotes and telegram messages, funneling them to his laboratory, where he would encode them and assign them each a new frequency. That frequency would be broadcast to a device that would fit in your hand, he explained. In other words, Tesla had envisioned the smart phone and wireless internet, Carlson said, adding that of all of his ideas, that was the one that stopped him in his tracks.\nThis tesla coil snuffed out the power in Colorado Springs when this photo was taken. Photo by Dickenson V. Alley, photographer at the Century Magazines via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\u201cHe was the first to be thinking about the information revolution in the sense of delivering information for each individual user,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nHe also conceived of, but never developed technology for radar, X-rays, a particle beam \u201cdeath ray\u201d and radio astronomy.\n\n5. \u2018HE SHOOK THE POOP OUT OF MARK TWAIN\u2019\nOne famous legend surrounding the eccentric Tesla was that he had an earthquake machine in his Manhattan laboratory that shook his building and nearly brought down the neighborhood during experiments.\n\nTesla\u2019s device wasn\u2019t actually an earthquake machine, Carlson said, but a high frequency oscillator. A piston set underneath a platform in the laboratory shook violently as it moved, another experiment in more efficient electricity.\n\nIt didn\u2019t bring the block to ruins, Carlson said, but it did \u201cshake the poop out of Mark Twain.\u201d Twain was known for having digestive problems, so Tesla, who knew Twain through their gentlemen\u2019s club, invited him over. He instructed Twain to stand on the platform while he flipped on the oscillator. After about 90 seconds, Twain jumped off the platform and ran for the facilities.\n\n6. HE HAD FAMOUS FRIENDS\n\nPeople aren\u2019t aware that he was close friends with conservationist John Muir, Seifer said. Muir, one of the founders of the Sierra Club, loved that Tesla\u2019s hydroelectric power system was a clean energy system. It runs on waterfalls, which Tesla referred to as \u201crunning on the wheelwork of nature.\u201d Also among his friends: financiers Henry Clay Frick and Thomas Fortune Ryan. \u201cHe lived in the Waldorf Astoria, at the height of the gilded age,\u201d Seifer said, adding that his fame later in life lessened.\n\n7. PEARLS DROVE HIM CRAZY\nTesla could not stand the sight of pearls, to the extent that he refused to speak to women wearing them. When his secretary wore pearl jewelry, he sent her home for the day. No one knows why he had such an aversion, but Tesla had a very particular sense of style and aesthetics, Carlson said, and believed that in order to be successful, one needed to look successful. He wore white gloves to dinner every night and prided himself on being a \u201cdapper dresser.\u201d\n\n8. HE HAD A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY AND A FEAR OF GERMS\nTesla had what\u2019s known as a photographic memory. He was known to memorize books and images and stockpile visions for inventions in his head. He also had a powerful imagination and the ability to visualize in three dimensions, which he used to control the terrifying vivid nightmares he suffered from as a child. It\u2019s in part what makes him such a mystical and eccentric character in popular culture, Carlson said. He was also known for having excessive hygiene habits, born out of a near-fatal bout of cholera as a teenager."], [2, "While I agree he was a great scientist and all.

According to family legend, midway through the birth, the midwife wrung her hands and declared the lightning a bad omen. This child will be a child of darkness, she said, to which his mother replied: \u201cNo. He will be a child of light.\u201d\n\n2. HE WAS REALLY FUNNY\nMost people don\u2019t know that Tesla had a terrific sense of humor, Seifer said. For example, after dining with writer and poet Rudyard Kipling, he wrote this in a correspondence to a close friend:\n\nApril 1, 1901\n\nMy dear Mrs. Johnson,\nWhat is the matter with inkspiller Kipling? He actually dared to invite me to dine in an obscure hotel where I would be sure to get hair and cockroaches in the soup.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN. Tesla\n\n3. HE AND EDISON WERE RIVALS, BUT NOT SWORN ENEMIES\nMany have characterized Tesla and inventor Thomas Edison as enemies (see this and this,) but Carlson says this relationship has been misrepresented. Early in his career, Tesla worked for Edison, designing direct current generators, but famously quit to pursue his own project: the alternating current induction motor. Sure, they were on different sides of the so-called \u201cCurrent Wars,\u201d with Edison pushing for direct current and Tesla for alternating current. But Carlson considers them the Steve Jobs and Bill Gates of their time: one the brilliant marketer and businessman and the other a visionary and \u201ctech guy.\u201d\n\nOn a rare occasion, Edison attended a conference where Tesla was speaking. Edison, hard of hearing and not wanting to be spotted, slipped into the back of the auditorium to listen to the lecture. But Tesla spotted Edison in the crowd, called attention to him and led the audience in giving him a standing ovation.\n\nSeifer qualifies it more, saying the two had a love/hate relationship. At first Edison dismissed Tesla, but came to eventually respect him, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen there were fires at Tesla\u2019s laboratory, Edison provided him a lab, so clearly there was some mutual respect,\u201d Seifer said\n\n4. HE DEVELOPED THE IDEA FOR SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGY IN 1901\nTesla may have had a brilliant mind, but he was not as good at reducing his ideas to practice, Carlson said. In the race to develop transatlantic radio, Tesla described to his funder and business partner, J.P. Morgan, a new means of instant communication that involved gathering stock quotes and telegram messages, funneling them to his laboratory, where he would encode them and assign them each a new frequency. That frequency would be broadcast to a device that would fit in your hand, he explained. In other words, Tesla had envisioned the smart phone and wireless internet, Carlson said, adding that of all of his ideas, that was the one that stopped him in his tracks.\nThis tesla coil snuffed out the power in Colorado Springs when this photo was taken. Photo by Dickenson V. Alley, photographer at the Century Magazines via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\u201cHe was the first to be thinking about the information revolution in the sense of delivering information for each individual user,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nHe also conceived of, but never developed technology for radar, X-rays, a particle beam \u201cdeath ray\u201d and radio astronomy.\n\n5. \u2018HE SHOOK THE POOP OUT OF MARK TWAIN\u2019\nOne famous legend surrounding the eccentric Tesla was that he had an earthquake machine in his Manhattan laboratory that shook his building and nearly brought down the neighborhood during experiments.\n\nTesla\u2019s device wasn\u2019t actually an earthquake machine, Carlson said, but a high frequency oscillator. A piston set underneath a platform in the laboratory shook violently as it moved, another experiment in more efficient electricity.\n\nIt didn\u2019t bring the block to ruins, Carlson said, but it did \u201cshake the poop out of Mark Twain.\u201d Twain was known for having digestive problems, so Tesla, who knew Twain through their gentlemen\u2019s club, invited him over. He instructed Twain to stand on the platform while he flipped on the oscillator. After about 90 seconds, Twain jumped off the platform and ran for the facilities.\n\n6. HE HAD FAMOUS FRIENDS\n\nPeople aren\u2019t aware that he was close friends with conservationist John Muir, Seifer said. Muir, one of the founders of the Sierra Club, loved that Tesla\u2019s hydroelectric power system was a clean energy system. It runs on waterfalls, which Tesla referred to as \u201crunning on the wheelwork of nature.\u201d Also among his friends: financiers Henry Clay Frick and Thomas Fortune Ryan. \u201cHe lived in the Waldorf Astoria, at the height of the gilded age,\u201d Seifer said, adding that his fame later in life lessened.\n\n7. PEARLS DROVE HIM CRAZY\nTesla could not stand the sight of pearls, to the extent that he refused to speak to women wearing them. When his secretary wore pearl jewelry, he sent her home for the day. No one knows why he had such an aversion, but Tesla had a very particular sense of style and aesthetics, Carlson said, and believed that in order to be successful, one needed to look successful. He wore white gloves to dinner every night and prided himself on being a \u201cdapper dresser.\u201d\n\n8. HE HAD A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY AND A FEAR OF GERMS\nTesla had what\u2019s known as a photographic memory. He was known to memorize books and images and stockpile visions for inventions in his head. He also had a powerful imagination and the ability to visualize in three dimensions, which he used to control the terrifying vivid nightmares he suffered from as a child. It\u2019s in part what makes him such a mystical and eccentric character in popular culture, Carlson said.

As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.  \n\n##Further Reading\n* \"[Third Reich Trilogy](https://books.google.com/books?id=HZmXOPGTGjIC)\" by Richard Evans\n* \"[Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7FiPwAACAAJ)\" by Ian Kershaw\n* \"[Auschwitz: A New History](https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-dZEV228QC)\" by Laurence Rees\n* \"[Ordinary Men](https://books.google.com/books?id=HFB-dkuZzSwC)\" by Christopher Browning\n* \"[Denying History](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-0B9-D5Vz4C)\" by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman\n* [/r/AskHistorians FAQ](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwii#wiki_nazi_germany)\n\n*"], [2, "Hitler himself was not present at the Wannsee Conference where the Holocaust was planned by the high ranking members of the Nazi government, but based on what we know about the planning that went into the subject, it is generally accepted by historians that Hitler was involved with the Holocaust, or at a minimum was aware of it."], [3, "Who cares if he came up with the idea first?

In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.  \n\n##Further Reading\n* \"[Third Reich Trilogy](https://books.google.com/books?id=HZmXOPGTGjIC)\" by Richard Evans\n* \"[Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7FiPwAACAAJ)\" by Ian Kershaw\n* \"[Auschwitz: A New History](https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-dZEV228QC)\" by Laurence Rees\n* \"[Ordinary Men](https://books.google.com/books?id=HFB-dkuZzSwC)\" by Christopher Browning\n* \"[Denying History](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-0B9-D5Vz4C)\" by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman\n* [/r/AskHistorians FAQ](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwii#wiki_nazi_germany)\n\n*", "id": "d6lz7c0"}], [{"comment": "Hitler himself was not present at the Wannsee Conference where the Holocaust was planned by the high ranking members of the Nazi government, but based on what we know about the planning that went into the subject, it is generally accepted by historians that Hitler was involved with the Holocaust, or at a minimum was aware of it.", "id": "d6lzeth"}], [{"comment": "Who cares if he came up with the idea first? I'm sure lots of crazy people had the idea to kill off all the jews. Do you know what year Hitler started killing jews? Here is Hitler way before than in 1920:\n\nSpeech delivered by Hitler in Salzburg, 7 or 8 **August 1920**. (NSDAP meeting)\n\nThe following quotation is from a shorthand transcript.\n\n\"This is the first demand we must raise and do [reversal of the Versailles Treaty provisions]: that our people be set free, that these chains be burst asunder, that Germany be once again captain of her soul and master of her destinies, together with all those who want to join Germany. (Applause)\n\nAnd the fulfillment of this first demand will then open up the way for all the other reforms.  And here is one thing that perhaps distinguishes us from you [Austrians] as far as our programme is concerned, although it is very much in the spirit of things: our attitude to the **Jewish problem**.\n\nFor us, this is not a problem you can turn a blind eye to-one to be solved by small concessions.  For us, it is a problem of whether our nation can ever recover its health, **whether the Jewish spirit can ever really be eradicated.  Don't be misled into thinking you can fight a disease without killing the carrier, without destroying the bacillus.  Don't think you can fight racial tuberculosis without taking care to rid the nation of the carrier of that racial tuberculosis.  This Jewish contamination will not subside, this poisoning of the nation will not end, until the carrier himself, the Jew, has been banished from our midst. (Applause)**\n\nNow lets see what Hitler was saying two years later in 1922:\n\nHitler's Conversation with Josef Hell, **1922**\n\nWhen Hell asked Hitler what he intended doing if he ever had full freedom of action against the Jews, his response was:\n\n**\"If I am ever really in power, the destruction of the Jews will be my first and most important job. As soon as I have power, I shall have gallows after gallows erected**, for example, in Munich on the Marienplatz-as many of them as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged one after another, and they will stay hanging until they stink. They will stay hanging as long as hygienically possible. As soon as they are untied, then the next group will follow and that will continue until the last Jew in Munich is exterminated. **Exactly the same procedure will be followed in other cities until Germany is cleansed of the last Jew!\"** (quoted in John Toland, Adolf Hitler.

If the German's had kept their 8th army there and moved all other armies to the East--the reverse of what happened in the real war--that single army could have done quite well in holding off the French offensive.\n\nThat leaves the 7 initial German armies free to attack the Russians, who despite surprising the Germans by being ready for war so quickly, would not have been able to withstand the full force of the German army along with that of the Austro-Hungarians. Russia would have collapsed even quicker, perhaps by 1916. If that were to happen and if the French were not able to break through the Germans lines in Alsace, couple that with the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Serbia--which would have more German troops to help it as well--and I venture it quite possible the Central powers could have won the war. \n\nThose are my thoughts, anyone else have something?\n", "id": "d30fmcj"}, {"comment": "While I do agree that the Eastern Front would have been much more decisive if the German Empire has decided to concentrate its forces there and then dealt with the Western powers, I still believe that British involvement in the war was inevitable; If not for direct aggression against a neutral power, then as a means to ensure a check of power against Central Power expansion. Not only this, but if Austria-Hungary had decided to occupy swathes of Russian territory, they would have had to deal with the inevitable political turmoil that was already brewing within the latter nation's borders.\n\nIf Russia had collapsed, I'm still curious as to how things would have panned out in the West. Yes, the Central Powers would have enjoyed a comfortable numerical advantage, but remember that mobile warfare doctrine was still not fully developed by 1915-1916 (recall the failure of the Spring Offensive because of the inability to sustain offensive spearheads). Numerical advantage or not, human wave attacks would have taxed the German Army and still resulted in the stalemate that defined WWI; That is, unless the German Empire was content with modest gains and was willing to negotiate peace, which would have been difficult given revanchist sentiment in France and the German Empire.", "id": "d30gfiu"}, {"comment": "Fair enough, I suppose it could go either way when it comes to Britain.

The Strassers, who were stupid enough to insist that the NSDAP actually be a socialist party, were eliminated; Otto in 1930, by expulsion, and Gregor was murdered by the SS during the Night of The Long  Knives.\n\n\nHere's a short snippet, from Wijiopedia about Otto:\n\nBorn at Windsheim in Bavaria, Otto Strasser took an active part in World War I. On 2 August 1914 he joined the Bavarian Army as a volunteer. He rose through the ranks to lieutenant and was twice wounded.[1] He returned to Germany in 1919 where he served in the Freikorps that put down the Bavarian Soviet Republic which was organized on the principles of workers' councils. At the same time, he also joined the Social Democratic Party. In 1920 he participated in the opposition to the Kapp Putsch. However, he grew increasingly alienated with that reformist-socialist party's stand, particularly when it put down a workers' uprising in the Ruhr, and he left the party later that year. In 1925 he joined the NSDAP, in which his brother had been a member for several years, and worked for its newspaper as a journalist, ultimately taking it over with his brother. He took the 'socialist' element in the party's programme seriously enough to lead a very socialist-inclined faction of the party in northern Germany together with his brother Gregor and Joseph Goebbels.

Two-handed swords are only slightly slower than single handed swords. They are biomechanically different which means a greater amount of training is required to weild it quickly, and maybe a pound or so heavier, but barely noticeable in trained hands. [This article](http://www.thearma.org/essays/2HGS.html#.V5ubi7grLRY) from ARMA shows historical weights and specs of two handed weapons. You can also watch HEMA demonstrations of longsword or Montante and take note just how quick the swings and motions are.\n\n2.) Thrusts from a well made blade with a proper cross section can thrust through a mail shirt. Enough stress can break the rings.\n\n3.) Swords, especially sword-and-buckler, were still used to great effect in pike battles even during the press of melee. Note that during The Battle of Ravenna, the German landsknechts suffered major casualties from Spanish sword-and-bucklermen in close combat as their bucklers allowed them to close distance while their swords gave them a massive edge in close combat. There are further examples of this occurring, such as The Battle of Barletta. This lead to many armies mixing swordsmen into the ranks of their pikemen (Italy, Spain), or at the very least equipping their pikemen with swords (Landsknechts and Swiss mercenaries)\n", "id": "d5w7e8d"}], [{"comment": ">Swords are expensive\n\nThey don't have to be.

The flipside, of course, is that this can be written off as propaganda.\n\n* The biggest argument against it is that yes, technically not all members of the military, or even of the Waffen-SS later in the war, were party members. People like to point out that we don't call the US Army \"Democrat soldiers\" or something similarly pithy. The flipside here, however, is that while the US is a liberal democracy where our leadership is freely elected in fair elections, Nazi Germany was a single-party authoritarian state where the party was synonymous with the state, and it would be quite hard to differentiate between the two. So while saying that the party in power in the US is not the same as the state itself, you really can't say the same with Germany during WWII. A soldier, party member or not, draftee or not, true believer or Social Democrat at heart, was nevertheless fighting for the interests of the Nazi party just as much as for the interests of Germany, if not more so depending on how you weigh matters.\n\n* Finally, while technically the name of Germany in that period was the (Greater) German Reich, it is known in conventional terms as Nazi Germany, and the demonym there is 'Nazi'. [And as we are speaking to conventional usage here, that does hold weight, even if it wasn't always correct.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change)\n\nSo anyways, the point is, that while you can make a technical argument that it isn't proper, I find the discussion to be quite academic. There is little wrong with using the term \"Nazi\" generally to refer to all German military personnel, at least when speaking casually. If you are writing an academic paper you might want to be more careful with how you throw it around though.

The flipside, of course, is that this can be written off as propaganda.\n\n* The biggest argument against it is that yes, technically not all members of the military, or even of the Waffen-SS later in the war, were party members. People like to point out that we don't call the US Army \"Democrat soldiers\" or something similarly pithy. The flipside here, however, is that while the US is a liberal democracy where our leadership is freely elected in fair elections, Nazi Germany was a single-party authoritarian state where the party was synonymous with the state, and it would be quite hard to differentiate between the two. So while saying that the party in power in the US is not the same as the state itself, you really can't say the same with Germany during WWII. A soldier, party member or not, draftee or not, true believer or Social Democrat at heart, was nevertheless fighting for the interests of the Nazi party just as much as for the interests of Germany, if not more so depending on how you weigh matters.\n\n* Finally, while technically the name of Germany in that period was the (Greater) German Reich, it is known in conventional terms as Nazi Germany, and the demonym there is 'Nazi'. [And as we are speaking to conventional usage here, that does hold weight, even if it wasn't always correct.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change)\n\nSo anyways, the point is, that while you can make a technical argument that it isn't proper, I find the discussion to be quite academic. There is little wrong with using the term \"Nazi\" generally to refer to all German military personnel, at least when speaking casually.

Stagflation in the early 20s, the Great Depression, and a general divisive political climate made Germany's situation even worse. Combine this with the aggressive actions of France, Britain, and Belgium (who were all seeking revenge against Germany), many Germans felt victimized. This is where the Nazis gained their base. \"We are the victims of [fill in the blank].\" (Monarchy, foreign powers, industrialists, aristocrats, Jews, etc). Most of those who bought this platform were the youth who were seeking identity in what could be considered a failing state. As such, the streets of major German cities turned into battlegrounds between the communists and Nazis. I could describe a lot more, but to jump into the main part: Nazi rhetoric that Germany is the victim won them 37% of the parliament in 1933, which forced von Hindenburg to give Hitler the chancellorship. \n\nOnce Hitler was in power, his state building campaign went into overdrive. Basically, Hitler created a racial community (Volksgemeinschaft) that most Germans ended up joining. To those who had seen the failures of the previous German society, a new German society that showed a strong Germany, a growing economy (the remilitarization after 1935 revitalized the economy), vacation days (many workers never took a vacation day and Hitler's workers' programs gave workers rights they have never experienced before). Ultimately, Hitler created a racial cult that became the central aspect of German society. To be German and successful was to be a member of the Volksgemeinschaft. Hitler's popularity reached its height in 1941 with German victories and success being the only headlines (probably 90% or higher). \n\nSo where did all his supporters go? Well the non-party members experienced the same thing their parents did after WWI: they felt betrayed by the man who offered them the world. Since his rhetoric revolved around the concept of a racial war and community, when the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" lost the war, so did Hitler's ideologies and the German people's commitment to them. These people wanted to bury their past and move on (which is part of the reason the 60s German youth movements were so successful). \n\nSo what about the Nazis, the party members? Well in the East, they died in Gulags and concentration camps. The Soviets were ruthless in hunting party members, no matter how high or low. In the Western occupation zones, which usually followed the directives of the Americans, the big players (Hitler, Goebbels, etc) were dead and the mid-tier Nazis were tried at Nuremberg. However, there were millions of party members. Yet,the Americans realized you cannot lead a country effectively without maintaining some of the previous state's structures (*cough* Iraq *cough*). For the 12 years of Nazi leadership,the entire country was nazified. To serve in the court, you had to be a Nazi. To be a teacher, a Nazi. You get it. So the Americans made a process that interviewed Nazis and then cleared them. So most Nazis in West Germany never faced any repercussions, and when the West German gov't came to power, they swept it under the rug. \n\nTL;DR there were Nazis all over West Germany after the war because the allies couldn't run the country without them. Also, it is essential to know that West Germany society after the war was incredibly conservative. West Germany didn't become as we know it today until after the 1960s. The 1969 Long March through the Institutions was the moment when the Nazis were finally exposed and removed from society (leadership positions, businesses, etc).

There isn't really a perfectly pithy way to cover such a complex topic, but much better than winners writing history is *writers* writing history. This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have \"lost\" the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus, but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within (or at least sympathetic towards) that order, and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.\n\nOf course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias.

It is a violation of principle. The government promised to help tribes and protect them, as brought out in *Worcester v. Georgia,* and then they passed legislation that resulted in harm being done to them and the abdication of the federal responsibility toward Indians.

This overrules the Treaty of Fort Jackson in 1814 where Jackson negotiated peace with the Red Stick Creeks. This is after he placed the consequences intended for the Red Stick Creeks upon the entire Creek Nation, [even his own allies, and forced them to cede 8 million acres of land](http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3026) outside of the 23 million he gained from the initial treaty.\n\n[3] [The Georgia Gold Rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Gold_Rush) is a fine example.

Again Chief Justice Marshall wrote the Court's opinion. He pointed out that a federal statute empowers the Court to review a final state court judgment that upholds a state statute and that also rejects a claim that the statute is repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. Furthermore, another federal statute requires the Court to hear such an appeal. In Marshall's words, the Court therefore has \"the duty, ... however unpleasant,\" to hear the case.\n> \n> Moreover, the Court held that Worcester was clearly right about the merits of his case. Neither Britain nor the colonies nor the United States ever extinguished the Cherokees' independence. All had treated the Indian tribes as \"nations capable of maintaining the relations of peace and war.\" **The United States specifically promised that it would guarantee the Cherokees all lands \"not exceeded\" and would regulate trade for their \"benefit and comfort.\" Congress too had recognized that Indian tribes are \"distinct political communities\" with a right to all the lands within their boundaries. Thus Georgians could not enter the Cherokee lands without the Cherokees' consent, and Georgia could not apply its state law there.**\n> \n> **Because the state statute used to prosecute Worcester \"is consequently void,\" Georgia had to release him.** After all, if Georgia had taken property under the authority of an invalid law, it would have to return the property to its owner; the same principle applied when the state invalidly deprived Worcester of his \"personal liberty.\"\n\nNothing to enforce? Read on:\n\n> In a well-aimed aside, the Court referred to the **enforceability problem.** It pointed out that **Georgia had \"seized\" Worcester and \"carried [him] away\" while he was under the \"guardianship of treaties\" of the United States, indeed while he was \"performing, under the sanction of the chief magistrate of the union, those duties which the humane policy adopted by congress had recommended.\"** Perhaps President Jackson would get this hint. Perhaps he would understand that his own authority and the authority of the entire federal government were at stake.\n> \n> Justice Joseph Story, Marshall's colleague, felt relief. He wrote to his wife, \"Thanks be to God, the Court can wash their hands clean of the iniquity of oppressing the Indians and disregarding their rights.\" A few days later, he wrote to another correspondent: **\"The Court has done its duty. Let the Nation now do theirs.\"** But he added, \"Georgia is full of anger and violence. ... Probably she will resist ... and if she does, I do not believe the President will interfere.\"\n\n*Still* nothing to enforce?  Read on:\n\n> Story was correct. **On March 5, 1832, the Court issued an order requiring Georgia to release Worcester.** Shortly thereafter, **when Worcester's lawyers asked the state judge to release him, the judge refused. The governor then told the state legislature that he would meet the Supreme Court's \"usurpation of Federal power with the most prompt and determined resistance.\"**\n\nSo the GA state judiciary and executive refused to enforce a Supreme Court order. *I wonder if it falls to another branch of the Federal Government to do so?* Read on:\n\n> **The president also refused to help enforce the Supreme Court's decision. On the contrary,** Jackson's secretary of war stated that the president, \"on mature consideration,\" believed that state legislatures have the \"power to extend their laws over all persons [that is, Indian tribes included] living within their boundaries.\" **Consequently, the president, he said, has \"no authority to interfere\" in Georgia's dealings with Samuel Worcester. Furthermore, in Jackson's view the president and the Congress had as much authority \"to decide upon the constitutionality\" of statutes as do \"the supreme judges,\" who, he added, \"must not ... be permitted to control the Congress, or the Executive, when acting in their legislative capacities.\"**\n\n(You realize this was *illegal* at the time, right? Read on:)\n\n> The New York Daily Advertiser told its readers that the president \"has said ... that he ha[s] as good a right to order the Supreme Court as the Court ha[s] to require him to execute its decisions.\" And popular wisdom attributed to Jackson the famous phrase \"Well, John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\" As Worcester languished in jail, John Marshall wrote to Joseph Story, \"I yield slowly and reluctantly to the conviction that our Constitution cannot last.\"\n> \n> **Marshall obviously feared the power of example. If the states could ignore the Court's decision favoring the Indians, why could they not similarly ignore others they did not like? Why should states or their citizens follow federal law at all? Why pay federal taxes? Why enforce federal customs law?** \n\nI'm not sure you understand how much of a Constitutional crisis this presented. *Surely, the Union would endure?* **Read on:**\n\n> Indeed, only a few months after the Worcester decision, South Carolina published a **\"Nullification Ordinance.\"** This ordinance made it unlawful to pay (within South Carolina) any duties imposed by certain federal statutes. **It required all state courts to follow state, not federal, law in these matters; it forbade taking an appeal to the Supreme Court and punished with contempt of court anyone who tried to do so.**\n\n\"Nullification Crisis,\" you say?\n\n> **Suddenly Jackson understood the political power of Georgia's example. Many in the South had long thought that states need not follow federal laws with which they disagreed. But Jackson as president now saw the threat to the Constitution posed by such a theory. If states could nullify federal law willy-nilly, then the Union might well become not the federation that the Constitution foresaw but a voluntary, and perhaps temporary, association of independent states.** \n\nI think you get the idea. Let's give Jackson *some* credit: \n\n> **Seeing the folly of his earlier position, Jackson reversed course.** On December 10, 1832, he issued a statement: \"I consider ... the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union.\" Then he acted. Allying himself with Daniel Webster, a strong opponent of the nullification principle, he secured enactment of the Force Bill. This new federal statute explicitly gave the president the legal authority to use federal troops to enforce federal law. Its sponsors had South Carolina in mind. And South Carolina, understanding this, gave in to the threat of force. It repealed its Nullification Ordinance.\n> \n> Just as Georgia's example affected South Carolina, so the South Carolina example affected Worcester. The general public understood the need for similar treatment of similar instances as a universal tenet of the rule of law. The newspapers wrote that \"no person but a Jackson or Van Buren man can see any essential difference between the case of Georgia and South Carolina.\" Wirt filed papers to take Worcester's case back to the Supreme Court for a further order, and Jackson, hinting at the use of troops, said he would enforce that order. Georgia saw what had happened in South Carolina and began to look for a settlement.\n> \n> **The governor offered a pardon.** The Board of Foreign Missions, Worcester's employer, urged Worcester to accept the pardon and withdraw the motion pending before the Supreme Court. Worcester did so, and in January 1833 he was released from prison. **Thus, the Court's order ultimately was enforced. Or was it?**\n\nHere's where your overly kind rendition begins to depart from reality:\n\n> **Wasn't the original point of Wirt's judicial effort to secure legal protection for the Cherokee tribe? Didn't the Court's decision explicitly state that Georgia could not seize the Cherokees' land, that the land belonged to the tribe, not to Georgia? What happened to the Cherokees' effort to keep their land?**\n\nAnd Jackson \"dindu nuffin,\" as they mockingly say on Reddit, right? **WRONG:**\n\n> **That effort failed. President Jackson sent federal troops to Georgia, not to enforce the Court's decision, but to evict the Indians.** In early 1835, without the authorization of Chief Ross and the Cherokee government, federal representatives arranged for a handful of the tribe's members to meet in Washington to negotiate a treaty. There they reached an agreement providing for the removal of the tribe to the West. Jackson proclaimed victory.\n\nYour position is revisionist history, pure and simple.", "id": "d2gscpn"}, {"comment": "> (You realize this was illegal at the time, right?

See this reaction to Marbury v. Madison by Thomas Jefferson:\n\n> You seem to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy.

Ty Seidule, West Point Historian:\n\n\"Some argue that the South only wanted to protect states\u2019 rights. But this raises an obvious question: the states\u2019 rights to what? Wasn\u2019t it to maintain and spread slavery? Moreover, states\u2019 rights was not an exclusive Southern issue. All the states \u2014 North and South \u2014 sought to protect their rights \u2014 sometimes they petitioned the federal government, sometimes they quarreled with each other. In fact, Mississippians complained that New York had too strong a concept of states\u2019 rights because it would not allow Delta planters to bring their slaves to Manhattan. The South was preoccupied with states\u2019 rights because it was preoccupied first and foremost with retaining slavery.\n\nSome argue that the cause of the war was economic. The North was industrial and the South agrarian, and so, the two lived in such economically different societies that they could no longer stay together. Not true.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, both North and South were agrarian societies. In fact, the North produced far more food crops than did the South. But Northern farmers had to pay their farmhands who were free to come and go as they pleased, while Southern plantation owners exploited slaves over whom they had total control.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just plantation owners who supported slavery. The slave society was embraced by all classes in the South. The rich had multiple motivations for wanting to maintain slavery, but so did the poor, non-slave holding whites.

All the states \u2014 North and South \u2014 sought to protect their rights \u2014 sometimes they petitioned the federal government, sometimes they quarreled with each other. In fact, Mississippians complained that New York had too strong a concept of states\u2019 rights because it would not allow Delta planters to bring their slaves to Manhattan. The South was preoccupied with states\u2019 rights because it was preoccupied first and foremost with retaining slavery.\n\nSome argue that the cause of the war was economic. The North was industrial and the South agrarian, and so, the two lived in such economically different societies that they could no longer stay together. Not true.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, both North and South were agrarian societies. In fact, the North produced far more food crops than did the South. But Northern farmers had to pay their farmhands who were free to come and go as they pleased, while Southern plantation owners exploited slaves over whom they had total control.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just plantation owners who supported slavery. The slave society was embraced by all classes in the South. The rich had multiple motivations for wanting to maintain slavery, but so did the poor, non-slave holding whites.

But it is a falsity to state that their efforts overshadowed those of the other Allies.\n\nFor every Stalingrad, there was an African campaign, which resulted in the capture of as many German soldiers as at Stalingrad if not as many battle casualties. For every Operation Bagration, resulting in the destruction of Army Group Center, there was a Normandy campaign, which destroyed or disabled  over forty German combat divisions.\n\nThe West's known battle casualties were not as high, of course, but Russian efforts to hide how wasteful their tactics were, especially on the attack, certainly helped hide some of the truth. It can further be argued that the 'hold fast' defensive tactics of 1941, which resulted in the loss over one million men killed or captured, inflated losses unnecessarily. Yes, the Soviet sacrifice in human life was huge. But as the defeat of the German Army in the field depended on the Soviets, the survival of the Soviet Union itself depended in no small measure on the Western Allies.\n\nStalin himself noted this at the Teheran Conference in 1943, saying in so many words that without the war production of the Western Allies, victory would be impossible.\n\nTLDR: The Soviets always have, and deservedly should, get their share of the credit for victory. But only their share."], [4, "Ever heard of the Katyn forest or the illegal annexation of Estonia in 1940 that resulted in about 200,000 deaths or the Kautla massacre or any/all of their exploits in Finland.\n\nPoint being here that while the Soviets were necessary to beat the Axis powers, they were a necessary evil.

While I think much can be gained from both the Western world and Russia more openly and fully acknowledging each other's contributions to putting WWII to an end, I totally disagree with the conclusion you arrive at ('Soviet efforts completely and utterly outweigh those made by other nations'). Opposing a murderous aggressor who's trying to conquer the whole world is not a competition, it's a necessity. I don't think you should be looking to establish who got the first place in the race to stopping Hitler. And even if you tried, what benchmarks would you use? The only easily quantifiable and comparable ones are the number of men a country lost and killed. Yes, more of both German and Soviet forces were lost on the eastern front, but I don't feel *'we're more important to the victory, we killed more Nazis'* makes for a good motto (nor does it account for resources spent/denied access to and intelligence gathered/withheld, all of which are important factors).\n\nIt's a great tragedy that millions of people, be they Germans, Russians, or British (and down the list of all countries involved), were being killed and forced to perform the unspeakable act of killing on an ongoing basis for more than half a decade.

The amount of American aid entering the Soviet Union through Persia alone (one of three main supply routes) was sufficient to maintain sixty combat divisions, or twenty percent of the entire Red Army at war's end.\n\nThe British sent 7,000 aircraft, over 5,000 tanks, over one billion pounds sterling worth of aircraft engines and 27 combat naval vessels.\n\nOn land, though, the defeat of the Wehrmacht absolutely depended on the Red Army, and that has been known (and duly credited by knowledgeable historians) since the war ended. But it is a falsity to state that their efforts overshadowed those of the other Allies.\n\nFor every Stalingrad, there was an African campaign, which resulted in the capture of as many German soldiers as at Stalingrad if not as many battle casualties. For every Operation Bagration, resulting in the destruction of Army Group Center, there was a Normandy campaign, which destroyed or disabled  over forty German combat divisions.\n\nThe West's known battle casualties were not as high, of course, but Russian efforts to hide how wasteful their tactics were, especially on the attack, certainly helped hide some of the truth. It can further be argued that the 'hold fast' defensive tactics of 1941, which resulted in the loss over one million men killed or captured, inflated losses unnecessarily. Yes, the Soviet sacrifice in human life was huge. But as the defeat of the German Army in the field depended on the Soviets, the survival of the Soviet Union itself depended in no small measure on the Western Allies.\n\nStalin himself noted this at the Teheran Conference in 1943, saying in so many words that without the war production of the Western Allies, victory would be impossible.\n\nTLDR: The Soviets always have, and deservedly should, get their share of the credit for victory.

The state will tell you what to do when it comes to reproductive choice, including contraception choices.\n\nAs scientific progress is to a large degree human progress, this is setting us back a century.", "id": "da3cot9"}, {"comment": "Ah it's an abortion debate then.\n\nUnfortunately i'm going to have to back out of this one, this is much too big of a moral and ethical issue for me to have a full on debate with you.\n\nMy own opinion is cultivated from knowing a few women who have had an abortion, one because she \"wanted to go skiing\" and the other because she was having regular unprotected sex with her boyfriend and spun the whole \"we're just not ready financially\" at the time she had a full time job her BF  had the same, and she had a supportive network around her and no debt, but she liked to go out partying every weekend. As a person generally speaking she was not a nice person, extremely selfish, and showed no remorse after the fact. Obviously i did not bully either of these women it wasn't my body and in our country a baby has no human rights until they are born.  You can argue at this point is it better for a child to come into the world with loving parents who dont mind putting their social lives on hold for a few years? Yes, absolutely. The counter argument here could be should these women be having unprotected sex and running the overall risk of forming a life to make the flippant choice to kill that child? No absolutely not. Abortion is not birth control.\n\nBut then you get onto cases of rape, of incest of a child being so disabled that it has no quality of life - what then? We've all heard of the stories of girls from Catholic Ireland running over the England to have an abortion because of rape is that right? I really dont think it is. I have no idea what i'd do in that situation if this should happen to me and i wanted to keep it would it be fair to expect my husband to bring up a rapist child? I doubt it.\n\nTherefore i'm taking the easy route out and saying its not for me to judge friend.

[There were other options on the table](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/08/03/were-there-alternatives-to-the-atomic-bombings/), and even the original \"schedule\" is not what happened in reality (there was supposed to be a full seven days between the first two bombings). This isn't to say that any of these alternatives are necessarily more favorable or desirable or \"should have been done\" \u2014 it is just to say that when you are forced into a false dilemma between two choices, it polarizes all discussion around questions that frankly I think are distractions, like \"what were the casualty figures that Truman himself heard, versus what others came up with?\" This is kind of an irrelevant question (the answer to it is, \"he was told a fairly low figure for invading Kyushu and the Kanto Plain \u2014 40,000 deaths \u2014 but they did have other estimates, and Truman didn't inquire because he either didn't care _or_ it was irrelevant to the atomic bombing issue\"), because even at the time there was no view of it being about \"bomb _or_ invasion,\" it was about \"what exactly do you do with the bomb, and if that or the Soviet declaration of war doesn't lead to surrender, then we'll invade.\" Or to put it another way, it was never \"bomb _or_ invasion,\" it was \"bomb _and_ Soviets _and_ invasion.\" Only after the war ended, and there started to be criticism of the bombings, did the narrative of \"we had to do this because we were certain it would not require an invasion if we did\" come about. (Specifically, this \"orthodox\" justification of the bombings takes its full form around 1947, in an article in Harper's that ran under the name of the former Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, but was largely authored by General Groves, the person who ran the atomic bomb project.)\n\nPutting _that_ aside, I would note that most professional historians would characterize Zinn's approach as being a bit overconfident in his counterfactual scenario. Were the Japanese on the ropes? Oh, yeah. That was very clear. But \"defeated\" is not the same thing as \"surrendered,\" and the difference does matter. \n\nWould an invasion have been necessary, if the bombs hadn't been used? That's a tough counterfactual to wrestle with, even knowing much more today than they did back then about what the various factions of the Japanese high command were thinking at the time. But it is worth noting that the idea that the bombs weren't necessary isn't actually just one that comes from far-left, latter-day historians like Zinn. The US Strategic Bombing Survey, in 1946, [concluded that](http://www.anesi.com/ussbs01.htm#jstetw):\n\n> _Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated._\n\nNow, did the USSBS authors have an axe to grind? You bet \u2014 their report is all about how it was all of the _other bombing_ that had reduced Japan to such a fragile state that the \"dual shock\" of the atomic bombs and Soviet invasion would cause them to finally throw in the towel. This is one of the reasons (alluded to in another comment) that many military leaders at the time thought the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary \u2014 because _the atomic bombs were getting too much credit for winning the war_. They were afraid that if people started thinking the atomic bomb was all you'd need, you'd be tempted to downsize the military in a drastic way, to put all your reliance on nuclear weapons. Which, in fact, Truman attempted to do... until the Soviets set off their own atomic bomb. Eventually, as we all know, the military got awfully chummy with the nuclear complex and learned to love the bomb, but that took some time. \n\nMy feeling \u2014 and this is about personal experience in talking with a lot of historians and going to a lot of conferences and workshops and panels and whatnot \u2014 is that most professional historians who work specifically on this topic would dodge the question, pointing out that  \"necessary\" and \"justified\" are both normative _and_ counter-factual terms (and both of those things make historians uncomfortable), or would lean towards a \"they were going to use the bombs anyway, there was no 'decision' or debate at a high level, so this is an anachronistic question to ask\" (which, I might say, I would point out is a problem with asking the wrong question \u2014 there was, as far as we can tell, no \"decision to use the bomb,\" but there were many smaller, but important, \"decision_s_\" about how to use it, and that is what a few threads of my own research are about). \n\nBut if you cornered them... held a gun to their head... really _demanded_ they take a stand... I think the lot of them would be pretty split. The way I see the field these days is a lot of hovering around a \"middle\" position on the bombs, as opposed to the extreme \"ends\" of the spectrum (\"totally justified, best decision ever\" vs. \"terrible war crime done just to look tough\"). The authors you are quoting, like Zinn (and Kuznik, who is also quoted by another response), are I think pretty anomalous in that they still stake out a hard, confident position on one end of the spectrum. (There are a few who stake out the other end, too.) The \"middle\" position, what the historian J. Samuel Walker calls \"[the consensus view](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/03/08/the-decision-to-use-the-bomb-a-consensus-view/)\", basically says that the bombs were seen as a perfectly fine, if not a little unusual, military decision, that they might not have been solely responsible for the surrender of Japan, and that the use of the bombs in the way they were used (on cities, little spacing, early August) was a mixture of vaguely strategic thinking (no \"grand plan\" on anyone's part, but people did have some ideas about what you might get out of doing it that way) and complete happenstance (the spacing between the bombs, and the fact that they had two ready to go in early August, depended on external factors that had nothing to do with real strategy). \n\nThe \"middle\" view would, like the \"pro-bomb\" view, emphasize the context of the war and firebombing (destroying cities was not a new thing at that point), but, like the \"anti-bomb\" view, emphasize that choices were made, and that it's not easy to say one way or the other whether the bombs \"ended the war.\" It's a position designed to satisfy nobody, in the end, because it doesn't make the bombings either a triumph of American decision-making (as the \"pro-bomb\" historians would have it), or an example of the maliciousness of American hegemony (as the \"anti-bomb\" historians would have it). It doesn't really satisfy any particular political agenda, because in the end it is saying that everything was kind of muddled up and haphazard.\n\nI prefer the latter view, obviously, in part because it conforms with my own view of human nature and human governance \u2014 messy and without very many obvious moral narratives. I would take some aspects of this a bit further, and have in my own writing \u2014 I think Truman [did not really understand what was going on](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/08/08/kyoto-misconception/), in many respects, and [I think most people underestimate exactly how haphazard some aspects of the bombings were](http://newyorker.com/tech/elements/nagasaki-the-last-bomb) (the Nagasaki raid in particular, which was a near-disaster and exemplifies the limits of trying to impose a grand-strategy narrative onto the bombings). But this is work-in-progress, so take it as you will. \n\nI would also note that this entire field of study is marred by over-reliance on post-facto sources (e.g. memoirs), which, given the explicit politicization of the \"decision to use the bomb\" and every aspect of it, tend to reflect more about how the memoir writer _later_ saw things, and not so much about what they were thinking _at the time_. In some places we have some very useful sources about what was going on at the time (memos, telegrams, diary entries, sometimes even recorded telephone conversations) that paint a far less orderly picture than the memoirs do. It is a tricky methodological problem, because as historians we do often have gaps in the archival record, and it is always tempting to \"fill those in\" with something from a memoir. But it can lead one down the wrong path, because you can \"fill in\" with the assumptions about what people were thinking (or knew) that lead to whatever broader argument you are aiming at in the first place. For my own part, the two things I always try to emphasize, both to students but even when talking with other scholars, is that we can't take for granted that people knew things (knowledge is tricky, and even if you \"know\" something you might not know it the way that we do later), and we need to make it really clear where we're taking a leap that gets us beyond an archival source. Taking interpretive leaps is fine \u2014 it's part of doing the job. But we should make it very clear where we are doing it, both to ourselves and to our readers, and not paper it over with \"maybes\" and \"perhaps\" sorts of clauses."], [1, "The question is how many were necessary.

Samuel Walker calls \"[the consensus view](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/03/08/the-decision-to-use-the-bomb-a-consensus-view/)\", basically says that the bombs were seen as a perfectly fine, if not a little unusual, military decision, that they might not have been solely responsible for the surrender of Japan, and that the use of the bombs in the way they were used (on cities, little spacing, early August) was a mixture of vaguely strategic thinking (no \"grand plan\" on anyone's part, but people did have some ideas about what you might get out of doing it that way) and complete happenstance (the spacing between the bombs, and the fact that they had two ready to go in early August, depended on external factors that had nothing to do with real strategy). \n\nThe \"middle\" view would, like the \"pro-bomb\" view, emphasize the context of the war and firebombing (destroying cities was not a new thing at that point), but, like the \"anti-bomb\" view, emphasize that choices were made, and that it's not easy to say one way or the other whether the bombs \"ended the war.\" It's a position designed to satisfy nobody, in the end, because it doesn't make the bombings either a triumph of American decision-making (as the \"pro-bomb\" historians would have it), or an example of the maliciousness of American hegemony (as the \"anti-bomb\" historians would have it). It doesn't really satisfy any particular political agenda, because in the end it is saying that everything was kind of muddled up and haphazard.\n\nI prefer the latter view, obviously, in part because it conforms with my own view of human nature and human governance \u2014 messy and without very many obvious moral narratives. I would take some aspects of this a bit further, and have in my own writing \u2014 I think Truman [did not really understand what was going on](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/08/08/kyoto-misconception/), in many respects, and [I think most people underestimate exactly how haphazard some aspects of the bombings were](http://newyorker.com/tech/elements/nagasaki-the-last-bomb) (the Nagasaki raid in particular, which was a near-disaster and exemplifies the limits of trying to impose a grand-strategy narrative onto the bombings). But this is work-in-progress, so take it as you will. \n\nI would also note that this entire field of study is marred by over-reliance on post-facto sources (e.g. memoirs), which, given the explicit politicization of the \"decision to use the bomb\" and every aspect of it, tend to reflect more about how the memoir writer _later_ saw things, and not so much about what they were thinking _at the time_. In some places we have some very useful sources about what was going on at the time (memos, telegrams, diary entries, sometimes even recorded telephone conversations) that paint a far less orderly picture than the memoirs do. It is a tricky methodological problem, because as historians we do often have gaps in the archival record, and it is always tempting to \"fill those in\" with something from a memoir. But it can lead one down the wrong path, because you can \"fill in\" with the assumptions about what people were thinking (or knew) that lead to whatever broader argument you are aiming at in the first place. For my own part, the two things I always try to emphasize, both to students but even when talking with other scholars, is that we can't take for granted that people knew things (knowledge is tricky, and even if you \"know\" something you might not know it the way that we do later), and we need to make it really clear where we're taking a leap that gets us beyond an archival source. Taking interpretive leaps is fine \u2014 it's part of doing the job. But we should make it very clear where we are doing it, both to ourselves and to our readers, and not paper it over with \"maybes\" and \"perhaps\" sorts of clauses.", "id": "d78zawp"}], [{"comment": "The question is how many were necessary.

Since the battlefield couldn't be supplied more than thirty miles (one day's round trip at 6mph, the standard speed of military logistics trucks in that day) from the nearest railhead, you couldn't take enemy tactical defenses faster than they could make new ones. Winning the war amounted to coming out on top in every tactical battle - and everything was horribly sucky and costly when it came to early-mid WWI battlefield tactics and doctrine. Long-range quick-firing artillery, MGs, and their ammo/support requirements were off the charts in a way that nobody had anticipated, and nobody got right until the Entente Cordiale did it in mid-1918. You can divide the entirety of military logistics and battlefield tactics into 'before 1918' and 'after 1918'.\n\nBy the time WWII rolled around, 4WD trucks that could travel (at more than 6mph) on dirt tracks and could be made at sufficiently low prices and in semi-adequately high numbers that large forces could be supplied using them. That meant that there WAS an Operational level of warfare again, and that something other than simple tactics mattered once more. The Germans were okay at Operations and favoured Operational Encirclements - and in the first three years of WWII, everyone else was just plain awful at them. \n\nIn the Anglo-Franco-American case it was because they had done almost no defensive fighting in WWI, had let their tactical arms (artillery, infantry, air, armor) grow apart in the Interwar Period, and had never needed an Operational level of warfare (which they didn't really think was a thing). In the Soviet case, it was the 1937 Army Purges. The Purges removed everyone who advocated Defense of any kind whatsoever (strategic, operational, tactical) because it was \"defeatist\", \"German/Fascist\" Tactical Combined Arms, and \"German/Fascist\" Operations.

Since the battlefield couldn't be supplied more than thirty miles (one day's round trip at 6mph, the standard speed of military logistics trucks in that day) from the nearest railhead, you couldn't take enemy tactical defenses faster than they could make new ones. Winning the war amounted to coming out on top in every tactical battle - and everything was horribly sucky and costly when it came to early-mid WWI battlefield tactics and doctrine. Long-range quick-firing artillery, MGs, and their ammo/support requirements were off the charts in a way that nobody had anticipated, and nobody got right until the Entente Cordiale did it in mid-1918. You can divide the entirety of military logistics and battlefield tactics into 'before 1918' and 'after 1918'.\n\nBy the time WWII rolled around, 4WD trucks that could travel (at more than 6mph) on dirt tracks and could be made at sufficiently low prices and in semi-adequately high numbers that large forces could be supplied using them. That meant that there WAS an Operational level of warfare again, and that something other than simple tactics mattered once more. The Germans were okay at Operations and favoured Operational Encirclements - and in the first three years of WWII, everyone else was just plain awful at them. \n\nIn the Anglo-Franco-American case it was because they had done almost no defensive fighting in WWI, had let their tactical arms (artillery, infantry, air, armor) grow apart in the Interwar Period, and had never needed an Operational level of warfare (which they didn't really think was a thing). In the Soviet case, it was the 1937 Army Purges. The Purges removed everyone who advocated Defense of any kind whatsoever (strategic, operational, tactical) because it was \"defeatist\", \"German/Fascist\" Tactical Combined Arms, and \"German/Fascist\" Operations.

The technological difference was not that huge, especially after they conquered China. \n\n\nTheir favourite strategy seems to be feigned retreat. They employed it many times, sometimes even against fortress garrison. As for details, I will use as example battle of Carrhae. Although that battle happened between Rome and Parthians, it was a battle of heavy infantry and nomadic army. Parthians kept firing at Romans, thanks to deliveries of arrows, and all attempts to break out were countered by charge of heavy cavalry.  Romans had to surrender. They were not undefeated though. In Battle of Ain Jault they were soundly defeated by Mamluks. \n\nThanks to mobility they could control large area with relatively small forces, they usually changed little in administration of the land, leaving existing establishment as long as it was loyal. \n\nConcluding, two main factors were their very high mobility which allowed them tactical advantage and loyalty of their subjects which allowed them to keep conquering without having to worry too much about consolidating their gains and maintaining large garrisons.

I'm not trying to attack you. I just want to make some point as to why the discussions gets murky when people mention railways. \n\nFirstly, the exploitation wasn't a two-way thing as you mentioned, the way you worded your statement gives off a slightly different meaning. India never exploited Britain. The financial transaction that happened during Britain's exploitation of India was a two way street. As you yourselves mentioned, 'Britain *had* to invest to take advantage. It wasn't out of interest to share technology or do any good to any part of the world.\n\n>Like what if india never got railway system what has this helpt or damaged india is har to say.\n\nNo. If we think in realistic terms, its not really hard to say. Yes, technically there are billions of possibilities, anything could have happened, aliens could have inavded earth, there could have been a civil war and this country would have gotten destroyed. But if you think about realistic scenarios, India would have done just fine without external influence, just like it had been doing for ages.\n\nThe reason why the mentioning of railways can make any self respecting Indian go crazy is because it makes the whole thing sound like some kind of a win-win scenario where both of them gained something. Whereas for any realistic scenario in which Britain would not have invaded India, India could have simply purchased whatever technology with the massive wealth they possessed.  In any case, it would be absolutely immature to assume India would have been reduced to what it was in 1947 if it wasn't invaded.\n\nSo, yes, if you want to include the money British spent on giving the rail engine technology, etc, you are welcome to do that and most people won't mind because it would hardly have any effect in quantifiable terms. But if you just mention it for arguments sake, it won't look so good.\n\nSorry if I came off as rude anywhere.\n\nedit: any inputs /u/damanmohansingh ?", "id": "d9u7ijv"}, {"comment": ">  It wasn't out of interest to share technology or do any good to any part of the world.\n\nWhy do things have to be reduced to one convenient reason?

But a lot of Indians absolutely hate the things that happened during Mughal empire and a lot of them want some kind of payback. Its a very sensitive topic and I don't think its reasonable to compare both or bring that topic in this thread, because (most of) the people who exploited India during colonial time have left.

This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that.

There isn't really a perfectly pithy way to cover such a complex topic, but much better than winners writing history is *writers* writing history. This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have \"lost\" the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus, but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within (or at least sympathetic towards) that order, and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.\n\nOf course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias.

I also mod over on /r/IndianCountry, the most active Native American subreddit, where we talk about issues such as this often. Come check us out if you want!\n___\nThere are a number of contexts we must look at when considering this question. There are a number of aspects that have contributed to why the majority of people within the U.S. view the genocide(s) of Native Americans as...well, not genocide. That includes areas such as religion, ideology, legality, and culture. This is gonna be a crash course, so I will source when vital to a point, but otherwise I will just rattle off the things I know and can be asked for sources in later replies if someone wants any.\n\n**Religion**\n\n[I recently wrote a piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/comments/4sk1ta/series_federal_indian_policy_the_papal_bulls_and/) that describes the kind of influence that religion had when it came to the settling of the New World. Ultimately, it boils down to this: European nations justified their expansionism by the Doctrine of Discovery, a doctrine that carried supposed divine approval from the Catholic Church. It is because of this doctrine that nations like the United States do not believe they have stolen any land or should return any land - it was \"discovered\" and thus the native inhabitants gave up their legal title to the land...somehow.\n\nWhile this doctrine is heavily discredited now, it was used as the legal basis for defending land claims in the court system of countries such as the U.S. This means it has become cemented as a formal part of law and hold weight as to why it is believe the land didn't belong to the Indian tribes. If land wasn't taken, how could there have been a genocide? While it might not seem like much at first, religious justification was used throughout much of the founding of America. It was included in what was thought to be \"civilization,\" a notion that both the common folk and government officials thought needed to be brought to the savage Indians.\n\nThis idea is manifested in the boarding schools that were either run by missionaries or the federal government, resulting in what is known as the \"Assimilation Era\" within the United States.\n\n**Ideology**\n\nFrom the Doctrine of Discovery, we have the \"divinely\" inspired concept of \"Manifest Destiny,\" which is just a fancy rebranding of the Doctrine of Discovery. What this new idea did do, however, was create a mentality within the American public that it was their God-given duty to spread out across the North American continent and claim, even take, the land that was supposedly \"theirs\" already. It would be necessary for them to either exterminate, assimilate, or relocate the Native Americans they were bound to run into.\n\nThe interesting thing that I'm sure you could see now is that this ideology includes religious undertones. And that's because it does. Religion also helped motivate the American public to move out further west, thinking it was their duty to do so. For [\"It was white man's burden to conquer and christianize the land.\"](http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/essays/1801-1900/manifest-destiny/the-components-of-manifest-destiny.php)\n\nBring this mentality into today and let's compare it to the Nazi agenda. The Nazi's were not killing savages or a group that was seen as little more than an obstacle to civilization. They were targeting a group of people during a time that a more liberal world was developing. However, the mentality with natives stems from the fact that for so long, they were not even considered human. The Jews, on the other hand, at least had that right outside of Nazi Germany. The rest of the world had a reason to help the Jews - it painted Hitler as the bad guy that he was. He was threatening everyone else and made the Allies his enemy. So why not draw attention to his atrocities?\n\nBy and large, the United States was seen as the hero after World War 2 and that means more people were willing to overlook its past sins. And besides, the U.S. knew how to minimize the \"Indian Problem\" very well by this time. An example of this is the reservation system. By pushing the natives out to areas where nobody could see them, how would people know there is a problem?\n\nBut this kind of mentality existed in other parts of the world. Throughout the 20th century, many nations held colonies. No one could very well point the finger at the U.S. without having to examine their own situation. Therefore, it was a non-issue to most people.\n\n**Legality**\n\nThis goes back to the Doctrine of Discovery. [This other piece I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/comments/4saavf/series_federal_indian_policy_land_and_minorities/) demonstrates the weird position Native Americans are in inside the United States regarding their legal status as \"domestic, dependent sovereign nations.\" Because of this, our identity as a people is marginalized and we are often seen as little more than just another racial/ethnic group inside America.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThis has probably played the biggest impact. Because America \"won\" the war, so to speak, they have gotten to write the history books. Almost any high school (edit) textbook in the U.S. you pick up will barely mention Native Americans if they do so at all. It will present to you a whitewashed history of Pocahontas and the Noble Savage. It will tell you nothing of the atrocities and broken treaties.\n\nAmerica has this culture of painting itself as being the \"leader of the free world\" because of its position in global politics. It has much influence over the perceived reality of things. Therefore, kids today grow up even thinking that no more Indians exist. I've personally run into that a number of times.\n\nCompare that to the Nazi Germany. World War 2 was such a global, earth-moving event that it is widely studied throughout an education process. And of course, the losers are the bad guys (though they actually were in this case). And this was a very recent event. While there are many recent events that are genocidal that befell the Native Americans, they did not have the same global impact that Hitler and his Nazi regime did, which I am sure most will agree with. This means that less attention is brought to a subject that most people have been taught watered-down and/or contradictory information on.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe idea that the Native American was a heathen, savage, and wild animal had developed over a longer period of time than what happened with the Jews in Nazi Germany. Because those in charge paint an inaccurate picture, most people do not think to compare the events because they are seen on drastically different scales. Myths are propagated over and over again, such as the \"Virgin Soil\" hypothesis and the \"Bloodless Conquest\" idea.\n\nAnd the biggest factor of all, I believe, is that the idea of exterminating, assimilating, and terminating the Native Americans was a general sentiment felt by the majority of the American public throughout history. This means that most people were not inclined from the beginning to view it is as a bad thing that was happening due to several factors such as religion, ideology, even politics. Bring this to our day and one could argue many people in our world today have ancestors who participated in these horrific events and by denying what really happened, they can disassociate themselves from any incurred guilt.\n"], [4, "Genocide is mass murder, not mass manslaughter.

I *can* say that it was the official U.S. Government policy to commit acts that were no more approved of in their day than ours that, when put together, constitute genocide and might as well have been the official policy.\n\nThe idea of Manifest Destiny swept across the American public in the 19th century. This included a mentality that resulted in the deaths of Native Americans, many of them being intentional for the fulfillment of Manifest Destiny.\n\nThe U.S. Government supposedly represents the U.S. public. When U.S. leaders make statements such as how they need to exterminate the natives, remove the savages, assimilate and Christianize them, at what point are they reflecting the opinion of their constituents and not just a personal viewpoint? I would say when multiple leaders make the same kind of statements over large time spans.\n\nI would say that you can't say every-single-person is responsible. Some people fought against these acts. But I sure as hell can say the U.S. Government was responsible and still is.

To place upon our most fertile soil the most degraded race of aborigines upon the North American Continent, to invest them with the rights of sovereignty, and to teach them that they are to be treated as powerful and independent nations, is planting the seeds of future disaster and ruin... We hope that the general government will let us alone - that it will neither undertake to feed, settle or remove the Indians amongst whom we in the South reside, and that they will leave everything just as it now exists, except affording us the protection which two or three cavalry companies would give.\"\n\n[--The Los Angeles Star, March 13, 1852, voicing general opinion toward treaties with Californian Indians and applauding state-sponsored attacks.](https://books.google.com/books?id=NYfUGPECUiIC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=March+13,1852+the+Los+Angeles+Star&source=bl&ots=cWzDCXZq1E&sig=6Im_4opD9qiKnLRbv7IAEWfx5To&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx2p3q9JLNAhVP-2MKHftoDuAQ6AEIJzAD#v=onepage&q=March%2013%2C1852%20the%20Los%20Angeles%20Star&f=false)\n\n>The Natives were constantly being displaced but as a whole they were never rounded up and then killed.\n\nWhile I would certainly argue this point (Wounded Knee, Sand Creek), people do not need to be killed for genocide to be committed.

I also mod over on /r/IndianCountry, the most active Native American subreddit, where we talk about issues such as this often. Come check us out if you want!\n___\nThere are a number of contexts we must look at when considering this question. There are a number of aspects that have contributed to why the majority of people within the U.S. view the genocide(s) of Native Americans as...well, not genocide. That includes areas such as religion, ideology, legality, and culture. This is gonna be a crash course, so I will source when vital to a point, but otherwise I will just rattle off the things I know and can be asked for sources in later replies if someone wants any.\n\n**Religion**\n\n[I recently wrote a piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/comments/4sk1ta/series_federal_indian_policy_the_papal_bulls_and/) that describes the kind of influence that religion had when it came to the settling of the New World. Ultimately, it boils down to this: European nations justified their expansionism by the Doctrine of Discovery, a doctrine that carried supposed divine approval from the Catholic Church. It is because of this doctrine that nations like the United States do not believe they have stolen any land or should return any land - it was \"discovered\" and thus the native inhabitants gave up their legal title to the land...somehow.\n\nWhile this doctrine is heavily discredited now, it was used as the legal basis for defending land claims in the court system of countries such as the U.S. This means it has become cemented as a formal part of law and hold weight as to why it is believe the land didn't belong to the Indian tribes. If land wasn't taken, how could there have been a genocide? While it might not seem like much at first, religious justification was used throughout much of the founding of America. It was included in what was thought to be \"civilization,\" a notion that both the common folk and government officials thought needed to be brought to the savage Indians.\n\nThis idea is manifested in the boarding schools that were either run by missionaries or the federal government, resulting in what is known as the \"Assimilation Era\" within the United States.\n\n**Ideology**\n\nFrom the Doctrine of Discovery, we have the \"divinely\" inspired concept of \"Manifest Destiny,\" which is just a fancy rebranding of the Doctrine of Discovery. What this new idea did do, however, was create a mentality within the American public that it was their God-given duty to spread out across the North American continent and claim, even take, the land that was supposedly \"theirs\" already. It would be necessary for them to either exterminate, assimilate, or relocate the Native Americans they were bound to run into.\n\nThe interesting thing that I'm sure you could see now is that this ideology includes religious undertones. And that's because it does. Religion also helped motivate the American public to move out further west, thinking it was their duty to do so. For [\"It was white man's burden to conquer and christianize the land.\"](http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/essays/1801-1900/manifest-destiny/the-components-of-manifest-destiny.php)\n\nBring this mentality into today and let's compare it to the Nazi agenda. The Nazi's were not killing savages or a group that was seen as little more than an obstacle to civilization. They were targeting a group of people during a time that a more liberal world was developing. However, the mentality with natives stems from the fact that for so long, they were not even considered human. The Jews, on the other hand, at least had that right outside of Nazi Germany. The rest of the world had a reason to help the Jews - it painted Hitler as the bad guy that he was. He was threatening everyone else and made the Allies his enemy.

There's been considerable debate over what Epicurus actually believed.\n\nOne thing we can say: gods were entirely superfluous to his cosmology. His cosmology did not require them.

But then he explained that he also believed in god, albeit an abstracted divine that was not necessary to his system. That's where the debate comes from. Imagine a modern individual. Imagine that all of their friends and family, and their society are Christian - so modern America, for instance. Imagine they tell you that they believe in evolution; they believe, in fact, in all of the conclusions and methods of science. They're also a humanist and live by humanistic moral codes. But they also say that they believe in God: they just don't believe that god had any impact on the universe at any point (so a deistic deity), nor did they begin the universe. The universe is explained entirely through science, yet they also profess belief in this god. Professing this belief allows them completely normal interaction with their family and friends, is useful for politics and other things, and pleases their Christian employer.

Cicero lambastes those other views in the opening of Book I of *On the Nature of the Gods* before his gives Epicurus' theology in xvi-xx. Specifically, in xvi-xvii:\n\n> Any one who should reflect how unthinkingly and recklessly these ideas are advanced, ought to reverence Epicurus and place him among the number of those very beings that form the subject of this inquiry, for it was he alone who perceived, in the first place, the fact of the existence of the gods from the idea of them which nature herself had implanted in all men\u2019s minds.

Enough would have now been said, if our aim were only to worship the gods with piety, and to be freed from superstition, for a divine nature of this exalted kind, being eternal and supremely blessed, would receive the pious worship of mankind (everything that is of surpassing excellence inspiring a just reverence), and also all fear arising from the violence and anger of the gods would have been dispelled, now that it is understood that anger and favour have no place in a blessed and immortal nature, and that, when those feelings have been removed, no terrors threaten us from the powers above.\n\n[Source](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/539#lf0040_head_019)", "id": "d02yieq"}, {"comment": "That's exactly what it is, and to the extent that that is all Epicurianisn is, the pilosophy is alive and well.", "id": "d02w8f5"}, {"comment": "The problem is that on the flipside of this, what is they had no reason not to.

I don't think you can describe any of that as atheism.

That's a no-brainer, if you will. Further, seeing that it appears that all primitive peoples seem to evolve through a stage of primitive spiritualism before reaching a stage of organized religion, then it is already difficult to argue that people are \"wired for religion\", otherwise primitive people would *start out* with religion (gods, clergy, ritual, rules etc.) and evolve from there. The very discussion of \"wired for religion\" smacks to me of the way western thinkers seem to forget about primitive spirituality as something unimportant and transitory, rather than the actual foundation on which all religions are based and of which those religions are all a sort of co-opting that exploit (intentionally or otherwise) the weakness of the innate spiritual tendencies to implement hierarchical power structures, systems of laws, or what have you.", "id": "d02rnd5"}, {"comment": "The Mongols tended to be all over the place in regards to religion.

Indeed, their attempt to reach the beaches and play havoc on the landing troops - ever one the most beloved scenarios of the German fanboys who think the Nazis could have won - totally floundered miles from the beach after their tanks faced a couple of British paratroopers who had no more than a handful of PIAT anti-tank weapons. It takes more than a couple of tanks to throw back an infantry division.\n\nMoreover neither the 12th SS nor Panzer-Lehr could have made it on June 6th. Anyone who looks at their War Diaries could plainly see how ridiculous this notion is. The 12th SS started arriving on the 7th, but they had spent the entire 6th of June preparing for movement and getting intelligence on where to go (otherwise they might have just been ambushed and chewed up like elements of 21st Panzer that tried to rush the beaches). They were not just sitting still and waiting for orders on the 6th (indeed, they been preparing since before dawn when word of Allied paradrops reached them). Even worse, when they \"arrived\" on the 7th, it was only with a portion of the Division - half of the tanks and most of the supporting infantry+artillery were still a day or more away! \n\nSo how could they have arrived on the 6th, even if they had completely skipped a day of preparations and sent men into battle without full loads of ammunition or fuel (and possibly still in their underwear) - when they arrived with less than half the Division on the 7th even _with_ preparations?\n\nPanzer-Lehr Division's situation was even more ridiculous. Half the Division wasn't even in France - because they had sent all of their Panther tanks back to Germany for repairs due to defects! The Panzer-Lehr in fact fought most of June with only half of its tanks. \n\nQuite simply, these two Panzer Divisions were in fact _not_ in any way ready for combat on the 6th. Moving 100+ tanks and 10,000+ men requires considerable logistical effort - which had just become doubly challenging with the Allies blowing up nearly every railroad in France leading to Normandy. They needed time to ready their vehicles and to organize the men - France after all was primarily a rest/refit area for the Wermacht - and by the time they got rolling the invasion was already well on its way to success.\n\nThe German Generals quite bluntly invented the whole nonsensical story that Hitler delayed armor reinforcements; to pretend they had magical skills at logistics and organization that would be useful to NATO in the Cold War and avoid the hangman's noose for committing war crimes. In reality the Panzer Divisions in France were just in terrible shape and couldn't be summoned for immediate action on the 6th; and when they did get into action from the 7th onwards they in fact got ground down and chewed to pieces over the next two months.

It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.\n\n##Further Reading\n* \"[Third Reich Trilogy](https://books.google.com/books?id=HZmXOPGTGjIC)\" by Richard Evans\n* \"[Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7FiPwAACAAJ)\" by Ian Kershaw\n* \"[Auschwitz: A New History](https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-dZEV228QC)\" by Laurence Rees\n* \"[Ordinary Men](https://books.google.com/books?id=HFB-dkuZzSwC)\" by Christopher Browning\n* \"[Denying History](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-0B9-D5Vz4C)\" by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman\n* [/r/AskHistorians FAQ](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwii#wiki_nazi_germany)\n\n*I "], [0, "A new database project on the Holocaust sheds light on the Europewide paths to extermination "], [0, "What I find hilarious is if everyone knew then why did millions of people just meekly line up to die?

If she wants to be taken seriously again she needs to be putting out more peer-reviewed works and avoiding this sort of sloppy argumentation.\n\nThe argument she's pushing - which is that Cleopatra was an ugly intellectual - simply isn't true.

But a professional doing that has some responsibilities:\n\n-1. To maintain their academic credibility.\n\nBettany isn't doing academic publishing, and she's not employed by an academic institution (the two marks of an academic Classicist). For a good example of how this should be done, take Michael Scott. He's done (and continues to do) all sorts of 'engagement activities', from TV appearances to movie consultation. But at the same time. i) He's a professional academic Classicist, as a lecturer in Classics at Warwick. ii) Check out his academic publications - 2 academic monographs and one edited volume, as well as 6 articles, in the past five years - which is not *amazing* (partly because he's had other stuff on and partly because he's still reasonably early career), but it's a very respectable amount and good books/publishers.\n\n-2. To accurately represent their field and argument.\n\nShe's absolutely not doing this. While on the broadest level she's right - that women in the ancient world are often caricatures that fit into particular tropes and *topoi*, the argument she's making here is absolutely wrong. Not only is it wrong but it seriously misrepresents the evidence and the method that an academic Classicist is expected to follow. Synthesising a variety of scholarship and making it understandable to the wider audience doesn't require misrepresenting things. If you can't do a good job of that, don't do it at all. But I suspect her sin here is more serious: she's pushing an ideological thesis using evidence and a line of argument she almost certainly *knows* wouldn't cut it in academic publishing. While the book as a whole is far from a perfect example of what I'm saying here, Whitmarsh's *Battling the Gods*, chapter two ('Good Books') is a great example of this. The chapter is an informed discussion readable to a general audience, and if it were re-written for a scholarly publication then it would absolutely stand up as a piece of academic writing and argumentation. Whitmarsh simply reframes solid argumentation, interesting and thoughtful analysis, and a great deal of scholarly literature, for a general audience: that's how it should be (and is) done.\n\nThere's more to say here but I've said too much already.

In fact, the implication seems to be that, at Actium, you Octavian and his Roman Legions going against Antony and Cleopatra who led a sort of multicultural army comprised of Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Syrians etc. That if they had beaten Octavian, it wouldn't have been the 'Roman' Empire as such but something else entirely based in Alexandria. Cleopatra herself is an extremely adept politician who uses everything at her disposal (sex included) to beguile Caesar and Antony.\nAs interesting as all this is, she eventually has to produce some evidence for this and unfortunate she pretty much runs into a brick wall at this point. Their simply is not the evidence to convincingly produce a full biography for Cleopatra. Mary Beard says as much in 'Confronting the Classics' and points to Schiff describing a young Cleopatra running through the streets of Alexandria. Pure conjecture. The only evidence not done by Roman hands is some archaeology (which shows Egypt was rich and not much more), graffiti (some interesting tidbits but nothing to build a biography off) and one(!) signature which is believed to be Cleopatra's. It says, 'let it be done'. That's it. Nothing else. \n\nGoldsworthy takes the complete opposite approach; essentially saying that, in the grand scheme of things, Cleopatra just wasn't that important. Caesar never legitimized the son he (supposedly) had with her, nor was it in his interests to, the Roman senate and people would never accept her as any kind of ruler and, ultimately, her entire position rested on Roman power. There was nothing separating her from the dozens of client rulers around the empire. It's not like Egypt was about to take on Rome at this time. She may have seduced Caesar and Antony but each of them could have up sticks and left at any time with no repercussions. In fact, Goldsworthy suggests that Antony essentially did just that. There was a gap of I think a few years where he returned to Rome. If things had gone differently there, who's to say he would ever have bothered returning to Alexandria?\n\nTL;DR: This desire to 'rehabilitate' her is nothing new but, in the end, Cleopatra is only remembered above countless other client rulers because she seduced two powerful Romans. It is now next to impossible to know the historical queen of Egypt since there is nothing outside of the Roman sources. What remains is the image of an exotic seductress, once you take the sex appeal out of that, what's left?\n\nEDIT: Spelling/Grammar", "id": "d0kxd5t"}], [{"comment": "The only place I can recall seeing Cleopatra portrayed that way is in Hollywood.", "id": "d0kj64o"}, {"comment": "I can recall a certain comic book in which she has a gorgeous nose.", "id": "d0knbhr"}, {"comment": "Asterix, right? :-)", "id": "d0knodt"}, {"comment": "http://images.mobilism.org/?di=9WYH\n\nBest comic book ever.", "id": "d0kohp2"}, {"comment": "I've only seen the French version of this in my 8th grade French class so I never understood the text bubbles", "id": "d0kt4s4"}, {"comment": "They made it into film too, starring Monica Bellucci as Cleopatra.", "id": "d0krpde"}, {"comment": "It is the funniest French film of the last forty years", "id": "d0ksfkz"}, {"comment": "The Fifth Element was a pretty fun french film.", "id": "d0l2lgs"}, {"comment": "for the French, last I read about the Ast\u00e9rix movies , non-french peoples prefers the others movies.", "id": "d0ktgo8"}, {"comment": "The first one was cool.

"], [2, "\"I am an American\"\n\nThey say that the reason why education is not listed amongst the bill of rights is because the framers of the nation did not want to install a mechanism for \u2018indoctrination.\u2019 Being guided by divine intervention, those early Americans of course wanted to prevent the perversion of their children\u2019s education, to which they believed was the province of themselves as parents and God\u2019s.  Or so goes the myth.\n\nThere is a fine line to the myth and the reality, but the myth is much in line to the events of a reality that led to legends that make up America\u2019s understanding of this time period. I don\u2019t want to discount the question; I do want to discount, however, the notion that the US revolution was some type of regular occurrence on the always changing horizon of human evolution that needs to be \u201cjustified.\u201d Moreover, every time this question comes up, it comes as a whitewashed avatar of itself, as seen through a very narrow lens, and not necessarily witness to the larger body of actors whose ancestors were not from European families, who played a major role. \n\nThe revolution was more than just a revolution; it was a change in paradigm, a cosmic shift that began a century before, and reverberates even to today. It included many people from many backgrounds, many of whom had no allegiance to a king, or ever heard of George III. It was a break in the status quo, that allowed new technology, or rather the spread \u201cof American ideas prior to December 1775\u201d amongst local communities.  This shouldn\u2019t be seen as only a Euro-centric-lineage situation here, as many ethnicities - both native and anglo-saxon-franco-deutsch included \u2013 contributed as resources of this shift in paradigm in the way people saw themselves in their own environment. \n\nWas the revolution justified? Absolutely - for each and every person who died in defense of their homes and possessions, AND who were maimed by its weaponry. And who were witness to the crimes of the Crown. Were these people British citizens? On part, sure! By magic Crown\u2019s wand, most everyone in America was seen as British citizens from the aristocratic eyes at London. Where these people self-identified English? No. \n\nQuickly, two points. \n\nThe first point can be illustrated with an image of a five pointed star. The first arm is \u201cAmerican Indians\u2019 influence\u201d; the second arm is \u201cforfeiture, takings, taxation\u201d; the third arm is \u201cfree men\u201d; the fourth is \u201cself actualization in family life\u201d, and last is \u201cfree-thought marketplace\u201d. Taken as a whole, these five points create a body of discourse of personal definition in American thinking which (for whatever reason) thrived. These descendents of the east coast, and New Spain were born in America, and had something which no one in England, or Spain for that matter had, American culture. Thus, a man and woman of that age in the 1770s would first and foremost be affected by the characteristics of growing up in North America. Not anything that would build lasting allegiance to Europe. Certainly, it wasn\u2019t all fame and glory for various segments of this population, but as modern people in 1734, and 1756, and 1772, the US was a good investment for the locals. \n\n*I note the Indians - because it leads to the second point. The plight of the Native American Indians influenced many non-native people in the days from 1627 generally, and onward. Interaction with Natives was quite common; was growing as the population would rise, and the countryside would soon see revolts of size from the skirmishes that arose in relation to the mass migration happening (varying from King Phillips War in southern New England, to (though not related, happening generally in 1680) the Pueblo revolt in the far west)). The role of Native Indian America in Constitutional discourse is quite important.\n\nBut back to the monarch\u2026 The Monarch saw the individual Tribes as free nations, which is where the term sovereign comes into play in modern days when we speak of the tribes. The Monarch passed rights to the Indian chiefs; much like the House of Windsor does to Heads of states today. The English king saw the Tribes as equal States and treated them as such. Enter the colonists, as mass migration from Europe increased (note: this is regardless of controversial Federal/Indian relations in the decades after). Which is why reservations are so important in the federal structure, as that land is the first estate. \n\nWhen the \u2018Crown verses the American freemen and freewomen\u2019 revolt happened, the States aligned themselves with various Indian nations. And as part of, now long lost, treaties (cue the clich\u00e9 dying Indian and broken Indian treaty) the Indian Tribes shared their sovereignty with the thirteen States. And, Voila! The thirteen States now had the sovereignty they needed to compete against claims that the English crown had rights over their heads as British Imperial subjects.\n\nNow on to my second point, and in this light... The US Constitution lists five estates. The first estate is the Indian Tribes, as mentioned  \u2013 because they are the only ethnic group specifically delineated to in the US Constitution \u2013  because they came before the federal government as their sovereignty as tribes created it. The second estate is the US military, which has its own courts and is governed by its own special set of laws, of which each new President is endowed and separated from the general population, when he is made its head. The third estate is the people of the \u2018States united\u2019, first beginning with the thirteen original, and expanded to the now fifty. The fourth estate is made up of the possessions of the United States like Puerto Rico, and formerly Hawaii, as well as, war spoils like Japan and Germany and lastly, the fifth estate is the nations and crowns, as entered into treaties with the United States. \n\nMass the three first estates\u2019 interests together - and include the notion that \u2018all\u2019 of these entities \u2018were put there\u2019 by the Creator - and there you have the rights of the American citizen as codified today. This was a breakthrough in terms of civil rights! Nothing on the planet like this had ever been done before, not even Rome and Athens could compete, let alone Britannia, but here came a newcomer rabble of Podunks. \u201c1776\u201d declared, and the wrath of the British Empire and all of its energies along with it, and then Washington crosses the Seekonk River with Rochambeau. \n\nThe \u2018Creator\u2019 is so important in this notion, because both the Colonists and the Indians shared a sense of a greater power, whether you call it religion, or spirituality. Thus, as children of a Creator, and not the King, and recalling that \u201cthe King afforded the Tribes the rights of sovereignty to be recognized at Court\u201d broke the peasant mentality the monarchs had gotten so use to. This personal self identity with \u201cAmerica\u201d is the turning point. This ability to practice religion as it grew out of the families\u2019 of the migration in America empowered the colonists to defend their home communities to the extent that they went to war with a foreign king they\u2019d never seen before. They of course knew their homes and towns well. On the other hand the animosity grew in the \u201cmother country\u201d and the Crown reacted resolutely at putting down the insurgents; the Crown was in danger of losing the money cow it was hedging its own financial bets on.  \n\nWhen you divorce the more modern events of this nation\u2019s history, and take off lenses that would view the \u201c2016 era as more advanced than that 1777 era\u201d you can get a sense of why the US constitution is written with a dialectic aim for \u201cself-evident\u201d truths. And that is entirely the justification. The damage the crown had done, the threats and violence the crown had committed, it was \u201cself-evident\u201d that a better life was had, because the colonists, and the Tribes, created it with no help from the crown. Thus to those \u201cself evident\u201d truths at the top of our most famous legislation, the States and Tribes assembled, revolted with as much justification as anyone today would. Because it was self evident to everyone, that the King needed his hat handed to him. \n\nThe notions of American Indian sovereignty, English constitutionalism, and German police power together make up the most innovative governmental system the universe had ever seen in 1777. A place George Washington\u2019s men only got a glimpse of when they justified becoming the greatest foe the British ever had the pleasure of losing to. \n\nBut the justification doesn\u2019t come from anything the British had done. The British were a second concern. The entire revolt really rests on the premise that the Americans and Indians didn\u2019t need anyone but themselves to govern. \n\ntl;dr Yes. Its justified. Because they were American. \n"], [1, "The colonies were not represented equitably in London in regards to the establishment of taxes. \n\nAs for the Seven Years War requirement American reparation for fighting the war..... the Seven years war took payments from the Americans to pay for England's 'Global Conflict' with European Nations, not just those in North America.

But if you have *no voice* in the passage of the tax to begin with, even indirectly through a representative, and no recourse to appeal it, and are basically being treated as third-class citizens in an empire...yeah, you're justified to rebel, at least in my opinion.

And no.\n\n It depends on your viewpoint really. However, we live in significantly more enlightened times than our 18th century counterparts so you do have to bear that in mind.\n\n The short answer is yes, as in many ways the British-Americans were fighting for 'freedom' and opposed to 'tyranny'. A noble cause surely.\n\n Yet, for me, the short answer becomes no. When you look at the instigators of the revolution, and many of the justifications for the conflict that arose thereafter, the notions of liberty become tarnished. Who instigated the conflict? Those who had the most to gain from independence from the British crown; the merchant class, the land-owners and the local nobles and bureaucrats. It was not the villagers, or frontiersmen, nor farmers. Not the vast majority of the population of the burgeoning Colonies. Don't let the historical revisionism of the victors alter the truths of the time.\n\nIf you look into many of the reasons given in justifying the cause of independence as right, they become fairly superficial under close inspection. Admittedly, British policing was often heavy-headed, leading to deaths and shootings of civilians and this is never really justified, even back in those days. Taxes certainly were heavy, but be realistic, even if the tax rate was 80% the effective tax rate in those would be perhaps not much more than half of that. Of course however, for the nobles, land-owners and merchants, their effective tax rate would be higher due to high level of bureaucracy involved in those social classes. (Lo and behold, the instigators of revolution are feeling the pinch). Let's get my reasoning for the short answer being no clear - the instigators, those who were the catalyst for all the bloodshed, destruction and discord than ensured, were only really serving themselves. Unless you have a distinct bias, that should be fairly apparent with some examination into the prelude to war. Thus, the revolution was built upon deceit, hypocrisy and the self-interest of the exclusive few; therefore unjustified.\n\n Nonetheless, the revolutionaries had to assert that they were the champions of right; what better cause than liberty and republicanism. With this basis of justification, therefore, the Americans were on the side of God - an ever pivotal factor for securing the support of the masses in such times. \n\nAnyway, so much for two short answers, I could continue all night.\n\n\n", "id": "czloez3"}, {"comment": "The British gov't was not truly in a position to enable more devolution to the US, such as they did to the later Commonwealth nations, for myriad reasons.

Or so goes the myth.\n\nThere is a fine line to the myth and the reality, but the myth is much in line to the events of a reality that led to legends that make up America\u2019s understanding of this time period. I don\u2019t want to discount the question; I do want to discount, however, the notion that the US revolution was some type of regular occurrence on the always changing horizon of human evolution that needs to be \u201cjustified.\u201d Moreover, every time this question comes up, it comes as a whitewashed avatar of itself, as seen through a very narrow lens, and not necessarily witness to the larger body of actors whose ancestors were not from European families, who played a major role. \n\nThe revolution was more than just a revolution; it was a change in paradigm, a cosmic shift that began a century before, and reverberates even to today. It included many people from many backgrounds, many of whom had no allegiance to a king, or ever heard of George III. It was a break in the status quo, that allowed new technology, or rather the spread \u201cof American ideas prior to December 1775\u201d amongst local communities.  This shouldn\u2019t be seen as only a Euro-centric-lineage situation here, as many ethnicities - both native and anglo-saxon-franco-deutsch included \u2013 contributed as resources of this shift in paradigm in the way people saw themselves in their own environment. \n\nWas the revolution justified? Absolutely - for each and every person who died in defense of their homes and possessions, AND who were maimed by its weaponry. And who were witness to the crimes of the Crown. Were these people British citizens? On part, sure! By magic Crown\u2019s wand, most everyone in America was seen as British citizens from the aristocratic eyes at London. Where these people self-identified English? No. \n\nQuickly, two points. \n\nThe first point can be illustrated with an image of a five pointed star. The first arm is \u201cAmerican Indians\u2019 influence\u201d; the second arm is \u201cforfeiture, takings, taxation\u201d; the third arm is \u201cfree men\u201d; the fourth is \u201cself actualization in family life\u201d, and last is \u201cfree-thought marketplace\u201d. Taken as a whole, these five points create a body of discourse of personal definition in American thinking which (for whatever reason) thrived. These descendents of the east coast, and New Spain were born in America, and had something which no one in England, or Spain for that matter had, American culture. Thus, a man and woman of that age in the 1770s would first and foremost be affected by the characteristics of growing up in North America. Not anything that would build lasting allegiance to Europe. Certainly, it wasn\u2019t all fame and glory for various segments of this population, but as modern people in 1734, and 1756, and 1772, the US was a good investment for the locals. \n\n*I note the Indians - because it leads to the second point. The plight of the Native American Indians influenced many non-native people in the days from 1627 generally, and onward. Interaction with Natives was quite common; was growing as the population would rise, and the countryside would soon see revolts of size from the skirmishes that arose in relation to the mass migration happening (varying from King Phillips War in southern New England, to (though not related, happening generally in 1680) the Pueblo revolt in the far west)). The role of Native Indian America in Constitutional discourse is quite important.\n\nBut back to the monarch\u2026 The Monarch saw the individual Tribes as free nations, which is where the term sovereign comes into play in modern days when we speak of the tribes. The Monarch passed rights to the Indian chiefs; much like the House of Windsor does to Heads of states today. The English king saw the Tribes as equal States and treated them as such. Enter the colonists, as mass migration from Europe increased (note: this is regardless of controversial Federal/Indian relations in the decades after). Which is why reservations are so important in the federal structure, as that land is the first estate. \n\nWhen the \u2018Crown verses the American freemen and freewomen\u2019 revolt happened, the States aligned themselves with various Indian nations. And as part of, now long lost, treaties (cue the clich\u00e9 dying Indian and broken Indian treaty) the Indian Tribes shared their sovereignty with the thirteen States. And, Voila! The thirteen States now had the sovereignty they needed to compete against claims that the English crown had rights over their heads as British Imperial subjects.\n\nNow on to my second point, and in this light... The US Constitution lists five estates. The first estate is the Indian Tribes, as mentioned  \u2013 because they are the only ethnic group specifically delineated to in the US Constitution \u2013  because they came before the federal government as their sovereignty as tribes created it. The second estate is the US military, which has its own courts and is governed by its own special set of laws, of which each new President is endowed and separated from the general population, when he is made its head. The third estate is the people of the \u2018States united\u2019, first beginning with the thirteen original, and expanded to the now fifty. The fourth estate is made up of the possessions of the United States like Puerto Rico, and formerly Hawaii, as well as, war spoils like Japan and Germany and lastly, the fifth estate is the nations and crowns, as entered into treaties with the United States. \n\nMass the three first estates\u2019 interests together - and include the notion that \u2018all\u2019 of these entities \u2018were put there\u2019 by the Creator - and there you have the rights of the American citizen as codified today. This was a breakthrough in terms of civil rights! Nothing on the planet like this had ever been done before, not even Rome and Athens could compete, let alone Britannia, but here came a newcomer rabble of Podunks. \u201c1776\u201d declared, and the wrath of the British Empire and all of its energies along with it, and then Washington crosses the Seekonk River with Rochambeau. \n\nThe \u2018Creator\u2019 is so important in this notion, because both the Colonists and the Indians shared a sense of a greater power, whether you call it religion, or spirituality. Thus, as children of a Creator, and not the King, and recalling that \u201cthe King afforded the Tribes the rights of sovereignty to be recognized at Court\u201d broke the peasant mentality the monarchs had gotten so use to. This personal self identity with \u201cAmerica\u201d is the turning point. This ability to practice religion as it grew out of the families\u2019 of the migration in America empowered the colonists to defend their home communities to the extent that they went to war with a foreign king they\u2019d never seen before. They of course knew their homes and towns well. On the other hand the animosity grew in the \u201cmother country\u201d and the Crown reacted resolutely at putting down the insurgents; the Crown was in danger of losing the money cow it was hedging its own financial bets on.  \n\nWhen you divorce the more modern events of this nation\u2019s history, and take off lenses that would view the \u201c2016 era as more advanced than that 1777 era\u201d you can get a sense of why the US constitution is written with a dialectic aim for \u201cself-evident\u201d truths. And that is entirely the justification. The damage the crown had done, the threats and violence the crown had committed, it was \u201cself-evident\u201d that a better life was had, because the colonists, and the Tribes, created it with no help from the crown. Thus to those \u201cself evident\u201d truths at the top of our most famous legislation, the States and Tribes assembled, revolted with as much justification as anyone today would. Because it was self evident to everyone, that the King needed his hat handed to him. \n\nThe notions of American Indian sovereignty, English constitutionalism, and German police power together make up the most innovative governmental system the universe had ever seen in 1777. A place George Washington\u2019s men only got a glimpse of when they justified becoming the greatest foe the British ever had the pleasure of losing to. \n\nBut the justification doesn\u2019t come from anything the British had done. The British were a second concern. The entire revolt really rests on the premise that the Americans and Indians didn\u2019t need anyone but themselves to govern. \n\ntl;dr Yes. Its justified.

After the bombs and Manchuria the Japanese surrender was unconditional, Japans emperor staying on in a ceremonial role was Americas decision, not Japans.\n\nJapan had just put up a very bloody defence on Okinawa, the same and worse was expected on the Japanese main islands.\n\n\n\nOn April 1, 12 days before Truman became president, the United States invaded Okinawa, located just 350 miles (560 km) south of the Japanese home island of Kyushu. The battle of Okinawa was one of the fiercest of the Pacific war. The small island was defended by 100,000 Japanese troops, and Japanese military leaders attempted\u2014with some success\u2014to mobilize the island\u2019s entire civilian population. Offshore, Japanese kamikaze planes inflicted severe losses on the American fleet. After nearly 12 weeks of fighting, the United States secured the island on June 21 at a cost of nearly 50,000 American casualties. Japanese casualties were staggering, with approximately 90,000 defending troops and at least 100,000 civilians killed.\n\nThe Americans considered Okinawa a dress rehearsal for the invasion of the Japanese home islands, for which the United States was finalizing a two-stage plan. The first phase, code-named Olympic, was scheduled for late October 1945, with a landing on Kyushu, defended by an estimated 350,000 Japanese troops backed by at least 1,000 kamikaze planes. Olympic entailed the use of nearly 800,000 American assault troops and an enormous naval fleet. The scale of the operation was to be similar to that of the Normandy invasion in France in June 1944, which involved 156,000 Allied troops in the first 24 hours and approximately 850,000 others by the end of the first week of July. Estimates of casualties from an invasion of Japan varied, but nearly everyone involved in the planning assumed that they would be substantial; mid-range estimates projected 132,000 American casualties, with 40,000 deaths. Truman told his military advisers that he hoped \u201cthere was a possibility of preventing an Okinawa from one end of Japan to another.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe second phase of the plan, code-named Coronet, envisioned a landing near Tokyo on the home island of Honshu in the spring of 1946 and a Japanese surrender sometime before the end of the year. The same mid-range estimate that predicted 132,000 casualties for Olympic projected 90,000 for Coronet. If both invasions were necessary, by the most conservative estimates the United States would suffer 100,000 killed, wounded, or missing, as compared to a Pacific War total that by mid-June was approaching 170,000. Thus, the best estimates available to Truman predicted that the war would continue for a year or longer and that casualties would increase by 60 to 100 percent or more.\n\n\nThe \"discrete channels\" were mainly the Soviets, and Japan initially even tried to keep all the territory they had conquered, their belated attempts at diplomacy were a complete shambles.\n\n\nAmerica in general wanted an unconditional surrender, this was not solely Trumans wish or doing.\nThe Soviet Unions invasion of Manchuria occured after the bombs had been dropped, and America had been urging the Soviet Union to attack Japan much sooner at least since the Yalta conference.\n\nMany people had their doubts, or alternative plans and opinions at the time, that does not automatically mean the final decision was a bad one. In July 1945 project administrators polled 150 of the 300 scientists working at the Chicago site and could find only 19 who rejected any military use of the bomb and another 39 who supported an experimental demonstration with representatives of Japan present, followed by an opportunity for surrender. Most of the scientists, however, supported some use of the bomb: 23 supported using it in a way that was militarily \u201cmost effective,\u201d and 69 opted for a \u201cmilitary demonstration in Japan\u201d with an opportunity for surrender \u201cbefore full use of the weapons.\u201d In later years, several key figures, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Douglas MacArthur, Admiral William Leahy, and Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy, claimed to have opposed using the bomb, but there is no firm evidence of any substantial contemporary opposition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are most of the declassified American documents concerning the matter and the discussions that went on previously and since.\n\n\n[The \"Notes of Meeting of the Interim Committee\" are probably the closest to what you're looking for in terms of primary source.](https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/index.php)\n\n\n\n[Source/figures.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trumans-decision-to-use-the-bomb-712569)\n\n"], [5, "No, from what I know, the bombs were only dropped so that there would be no need for a land invasion, which would be even more catastrophic for Japan"], [4, "You are right Japan should have surrendered before the bombs were dropped but they didn't.

Japan was a nation where the Emperor held divine authority, but actual policy was controlled by militarists. First the samurai in the form of the shogunate, and later the westernized armed forces in the form of the Meiji Restoration. \n\nThe Japanese would continue fighting as far as the US knew, or perhaps lure them into an ambush. The frantic preparations that Japan was making for the final American invasion would certainly have been on the radar of American analysts. I've read that the Japanese drained Korea of their best troops, leaving a series of lines to hopefully slow down the expected Soviet invasion.\n\nThe Soviet invasion didn't come out of the shadows - it was a specific result of the Potsdam conference. The Soviets invaded per an agreed schedule, which likely would have been leaked to pro-Japanese intelligence agents to bolster the argument that Japan should surrender unconditionally.

They chose the defense of the home islands as a last ditch effort, instead of fearing that the Soviets might inherit some Asian territory. The core essence of Japanese nationalism does not reside in Korea, but in Japan proper.\n\nAnd, in my opinion, Matome Ugaki was a rather competent commander who would have leveraged the Japanese experience at Okinawa to inflict some serious harm on the American invasion forces. I feel that the Americans knew this, given the fact that they actually fought at Okinawa and observed the evolution of Japanese suicide tactics. \n\nFrom both sides of the equation, if you feel that the only way to force Japan to capitulate is to threaten the actual nation of Japan, then the bombs were a good way to end the conflict with as little loss of life as possible. \n\n "], [3, "Truman claimed to regret dropping the bombs but also claimed he was glass of the amount of life saved.

Shorten the war. Usage of such a devastating weapon would force Japan to accept unconditional surrender sooner. If the US had been forced to invade Japan, then it would have lead to massive Allied casualties and Japanese deaths. The problem with this justification is that it also came about years after the war was over.   All figures that describe estimated casualties/deaths for a potential invasion of Japan(which were estimated to be massive) came from after the war as well. \n\nThe short answer for dropping the bomb is very anticlimactic and unimpressive: the US dropped the nuclear bombs of Japan because the US was at war with Japan and the bombs were bombs. We were already dropping bombs on Japan (firebombings of Tokyo killed more than both nuclear bombs) so the US military dropped what bombs they had. Harry Truman considered the nuclear bombs as simply that, bombs and weapons to be used against the enemy of the United States.

Another option was to explore other surrender methods such as displaying a detonated bomb away from civilian areas, waiting until after the USSR ground invasion in the north, or like we did in the Spanish Amer war, leave the existing people (the Emperor) in power subject to delineated control by the Allies (it's not like we needed to aquire Japan after WW2, just keep them peaceful).\n\nI share your concern about respect for the dead folks who actually made lesser evil type decisions, but I see it a little differently when it comes to war, atrocities, violence. If we go easy or reduce scrutiny when analyzing our use of the bombs, we run the risk of failing to see sociopathy or systemic evils. One might argue that risk and it's costs are so great we should welcome and encourage critical analysis so the Trumans of the world never feel very comfortable when deciding to commit atrocities, even when those atrocities are in response to someone else's atrocities, because atrocities should be avoided whenever possible.\n\nThanks again for the discussion.", "id": "daqw1ai"}, {"comment": "Continued Total War will lessen the moral fiber of the combatants. You are right that the bomb drop was celebrated because it was a hope for an end of the long and very bloody war. They didn't cheer for the death in of itself.

In such a case of continued war with an enemy that refused to surrender but has proven to be too dangerous to leave alone and cost more of your soilders for every solider of theirs you killed. Even in todays society if you had a chance to shock this intractable enemy to end the conflict you may take it. You could look at potential causality cost as a small price to pay. Its not hard, once you enter in their mindset, to see why people decided to used the bomb and their reactions to its successful use. Its entirely possible in a similar situation history could repeat itself.\n\nOn the possibility of negotiated peace, at the time that didn't seem possible. Japan would have probably built up its power again to challenge the eastern pacific. Or at least that was what was believed at the time and its not unreasonable based on Japans actions in China and hoe Germany rebuilt its war machin in a few short decades after world war I. Further its unlikely the Soviets would have accepted an independent Japan.

Only by avoiding these great wars can we avoid the situation where rational people will uses terrible weapons for the good of society *and possibly be right to use it*.\n\nThis is commonly known as the foreign policy of keeping wars small to pervent large wars.

Japan was a nation where the Emperor held divine authority, but actual policy was controlled by militarists. First the samurai in the form of the shogunate, and later the westernized armed forces in the form of the Meiji Restoration. \n\nThe Japanese would continue fighting as far as the US knew, or perhaps lure them into an ambush. The frantic preparations that Japan was making for the final American invasion would certainly have been on the radar of American analysts. I've read that the Japanese drained Korea of their best troops, leaving a series of lines to hopefully slow down the expected Soviet invasion.\n\nThe Soviet invasion didn't come out of the shadows - it was a specific result of the Potsdam conference. The Soviets invaded per an agreed schedule, which likely would have been leaked to pro-Japanese intelligence agents to bolster the argument that Japan should surrender unconditionally. The same type of thing that they pulled on [December 4th](http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1941/12/04/page/1/article/f-d-r-s-war-plans/) of '41 - bait which Hitler took in his speech of [December 10th](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v08/v08p389_Hitler.html) of that same year...\n\nThe Japanese made their choice. They chose the defense of the home islands as a last ditch effort, instead of fearing that the Soviets might inherit some Asian territory. The core essence of Japanese nationalism does not reside in Korea, but in Japan proper.\n\nAnd, in my opinion, Matome Ugaki was a rather competent commander who would have leveraged the Japanese experience at Okinawa to inflict some serious harm on the American invasion forces. I feel that the Americans knew this, given the fact that they actually fought at Okinawa and observed the evolution of Japanese suicide tactics. \n\nFrom both sides of the equation, if you feel that the only way to force Japan to capitulate is to threaten the actual nation of Japan, then the bombs were a good way to end the conflict with as little loss of life as possible. \n\n ", "id": "daqqhhm"}, {"comment": "Man your comment is such a nice reward for my post.

The failure of Kurita's force at the Battle of Leyte Gulf split the Japanese empire in two. \n\nThey had effectively run out of any of the oil supplies that they had purchased before the war from the United States (pre-war estimates stated it would occur in 1944, but it was likely earlier due to the increased demands of a wartime force). The only fuel they were running on came from Palembang, which was quite difficult to transport to the home islands. This is why they split their fleet after the Battle of the Philippines Sea. The carriers needed to rearm after the disastrous Marianas Turkey Shoot, but they already couldn't get enough bunker fuel in Japan to support the full battle fleet. Therefore the carriers returned to Japan while the battlewagons went south.\n\nThis almost provided a tactical benefit at Leyte Gulf. The Americans had fully shifted to the modern carrier-centric philosophy, leading Halsey to fall for Ozawa's bait of the depleted Japanese carrier force.  Had Kurita pushed harder on his offense, he might have put a dent in the unprotected American fleet which would have bought the Japanese a little time. Instead, they lost Musashi and were later forced to send Yamato on a failed one-way kamikaze mission at Okinawa. \n\nBattleships ran on the lowest grade of petroleum distillates, mainly the leftover sludge that was mixed together and called bunker fuel. Gasoline is a higher-grade distillate, which was, for aircraft, notorious for needing extra processing to mitigate detonation in high performance engines. Needless to say, you get much more bunker fuel out of a barrel of oil than you do gasoline. Especially in Japan, which wasn't in the know of modern German-American chemistry. If they could only send Yamato on a one-way trip, they certainly weren't swimming in the aviation gasoline needed to actually interdict the American bombing offensive. \n\nIf you check out Yergin's history of the oil industry, he discusses the Japanese supply problems. By the end of the war, they were stripping mountainsides of pine trees and pine roots to distill into a low-quality gasoline substitute. Many planes simply did not make it to their destinations, which points to fuel-related attrition at a time when American numbers kept increasing. It wouldn't be long until they were swept from the air completely. \n\n >they (1) came from a single plane giving Japan no fighting chance to defend itself\n\nThis is actually a result of the fuel situation. Under normal circumstances, the Enola Gay wouldn't expect to have a fighting chance to defend itself. The Japanese were so short on fuel that they allowed small flights to proceed unmolested. Had the US opted for continuous small raids against a diverse list of targets instead of intermittent massed raids, the Japanese would be finished even earlier. \n\n>(2) were far beyond anything that could be understood by Japan, which meant massive civilian casualties were inevitable,\n\nThe Japanese had their own nuclear physicists and a nuclear program. I believe it was that understanding of the situation which led them to abandon their final defense plan and surrender. They were quite willing to accept civilian casualties by conventional means, but were deathly afraid of unconventional warfare. While they conducted chemical warfare in China, they purposely kept those munitions away from fronts which might involve a well-endowed western power. Similarly, it's highly likely that they would have felt the same fear of the new nuclear ordnance once their physicists confirmed what it was that they were dealing with. \n\n>(3) more traditional bombs could be focused on military targets to win the war and protect US lives, as opposed to needlessly killing or partially incinerating civilians\n\nMost of those military targets had already been hit. The IJN was crippled from the USN's raids and the virtual blockade imposed by the USAAF's \"Operation Starvation\". Most industrial centers had already been crippled from the massed raids, and you're not going to accurately bomb smaller targets with 1940s technology.\n\nThe experience on Iwo Jima and Okinawa also showed the limitations of heavy strategic bombardment on small, dug-in military installations. Similar preparations were being made by the Japanese on Kyushu, with an added bite to strike out at the invasion fleet. The best option for the strategic bomber force was just the way it was employed - maintaining the naval blockade and conducting \"morale bombing\" to hasten the unconditional Japanese surrender. \n\n>(4) by the time of the atomic bombs, either Japan was already prepared to surrender or the US knew USSR would fight the Japanese with an overwhelming ground force that had already defeated the much more formidable German army.\n\nSee the earlier comment on unconditional surrender. The Japanese were not going to surrender per the conditions of the Potsdam Declaration(Russia had already tried), which is why the firebombing would continue in the hopes of averting a potentially disastrous landing on Kyushu. Japan had a defense philosophy focused on their home islands, and repatriated as many high-quality troops and munitions from the mainland as they could before they were cut off by Operation Starvation. Having broken most Japanese military and diplomatic codes, the US would have known this about the Japanese.\n\nThe US would also know how unlikely it was that the Soviet military invading Manchuria would affect the Japanese outlook. The type of operation required to threaten Japanese national sovereignty was something that only the United States had demonstrated an ability to achieve. The Soviets had to use lend-lease hulls to mount an invasion of poorly defended islands in the north to lay a claim to any true Japanese territory. It was a small force that was in a logistically tenuous situation if the Japanese decided to mount a serious resistance effort. They were lucky that the surrender occurred before this could happen. \n\n\nTo discuss the original question of the thread, there doesn't seem to be any reason for the US to have considered the bombs to be political leverage over the Soviets. Truman himself told Stalin about a new weapon at the Potsdam conference. The US still got the Soviets to invade on their timeline, and still awarded them parts of Chinese sovereign territory, Korea and Vietnam in the deal. Truman was also the President who later sacked MacArthur for insisting upon using nukes against China when they would have aided the US Cold War posture. It wouldn't be until 1946 that the Soviets were dealt with as a threat by the United States - in the meantime the entire focus was on the capitulation of Japan.

It is natural and excusable for men in our position to turn more ways than one both in thought and utterance. However, the question in this conference is, as you say, the safety of our country; and the discussion, if you please, can proceed in the way which you propose.\n\n**Athenians**. For ourselves, we shall not trouble you with specious pretences- either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the Mede, or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done us- and make a long speech which would not be believed; and in return we hope that you, instead of thinking to influence us by saying that you did not join the Lacedaemonians, although their colonists, or that you have done us no wrong, will aim at what is feasible, holding in view the real sentiments of us both; **since you know as well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.**\n\n**Melians**. As we think, at any rate, it is expedient- we speak as we are obliged, since you enjoin us to let right alone and talk only of interest- that you should not destroy what is our common protection, the privilege of being allowed in danger to invoke what is fair and right, and even to profit by arguments not strictly valid if they can be got to pass current. And you are as much interested in this as any, as your fall would be a signal for the heaviest vengeance and an example for the world to meditate upon.\n\n**Athenians.** The end of our empire, if end it should, does not frighten us: a rival empire like Lacedaemon, even if Lacedaemon was our real antagonist, is not so terrible to the vanquished as subjects who by themselves attack and overpower their rulers. This, however, is a risk that we are content to take. We will now proceed to show you that we are come here in the interest of our empire, and that we shall say what we are now going to say, for the preservation of your country; as we would fain exercise that empire over you without trouble, and see you preserved for the good of us both.\n\n**Melians.** And how, pray, could it turn out as good for us to serve as for you to rule?\n\n**Athenians.** Because you would have the advantage of submitting before suffering the worst, and we should gain by not destroying you.\n\n**Melians.** So that you would not consent to our being neutral, friends instead of enemies, but allies of neither side.\n\n**Athenians.** No; for your hostility cannot so much hurt us as your friendship will be an argument to our subjects of our weakness, and your enmity of our power.\n\n**Melians.** Is that your subjects' idea of equity, to put those who have nothing to do with you in the same category with peoples that are most of them your own colonists, and some conquered rebels?\n\n**Athenians.** As far as right goes they think one has as much of it as the other, and that if any maintain their independence it is because they are strong, and that if we do not molest them it is because we are afraid; so that besides extending our empire we should gain in security by your subjection; the fact that you are islanders and weaker than others rendering it all the more important that you should not succeed in baffling the masters of the sea.\n\n**Melians.** But do you consider that there is no security in the policy which we indicate? For here again if you debar us from talking about justice and invite us to obey your interest, we also must explain ours, and try to persuade you, if the two happen to coincide. How can you avoid making enemies of all existing neutrals who shall look at case from it that one day or another you will attack them? And what is this but to make greater the enemies that you have already, and to force others to become so who would otherwise have never thought of it?\n\n**Athenians.** Why, the fact is that continentals generally give us but little alarm; the liberty which they enjoy will long prevent their taking precautions against us; it is rather islanders like yourselves, outside our empire, and subjects smarting under the yoke, who would be the most likely to take a rash step and lead themselves and us into obvious danger.", "id": "d1epshk"}, {"comment": "What's a damn Sassanian doing knowing so much about Greece?!", "id": "d1esv2f"}], [{"comment": "\"they used it as rationalization to kill innocent people.\"  \nSigh, OP.

Lots to cover whether you like cultural/religious/political focuses. Lets you bring in archaeological sources that could work well. Allows some interesting comparisons (e.g. the settlement of the Rus compared with the Normans). \n\nThe Norman Conquest - classic period of history loads of source material (both primary and secondary) with a fair bit online. \nBlack Death - again a relatively famous event in English history, lots of economic theory/cultural changes. Could be widened to a European take as a whole. \n\nWar of the Roses - I find it very interesting. Lots of in-fighting, think Game of Thrones in late medieval England. Can be rather hard to get a grasp on, but should be doable for a-level. \n\nJapanese Unification - 3 big military campaigns by 'the unifiers'. Can be used to demonstrate/argue against the idea of military revolution theory. Shows a dramatic change in societal structure, and dictated Japan's foreign policy for years to come. Primary sources would be harder to deal with, but there is plenty written on the topic.\n\nthe Manchu conquest of China - I think this would be hard, as getting to grips with the Chinese forms of government, and why the Manchu's succeeded.

The theories for why conversion happened/didn't happen are pretty fascinating.  \n\nFor more modern the 19th C. in Europe has many 'Age of....' titles (revolution, industrialisation, empires, etc.). You could pick one of these to focus on, and compare across countries. \n\nI haven't covered later than this (being a medievalist). But for the world wars, I'd recommend a particular theatre, event or country to focus on. E.g - UK's contribution, the Pacific theatre (even these are probably far too broad), effects of trench warfare, the raid of Dieppe etc. Don't try to cover anything near the whole thing. Start with the broad stuff suggested elsewhere and find what you like. \n\nIf you want to do the Cold War I'd have similar advice, look at a particular conflict (Cuba, Vietnam, American counter-culture movement, division of Germany), rather than trying to cover the whole period. \n\nHope this helps.\n", "id": "d4pub55"}], [{"comment": "Maybe WW1 if your allowed to go that modern.

And besides, it was fun: battles, weapons, etc.  \n\nAs I've gotten older, and actually started teaching history, I've realized that military history is fun because it's easy.  It's straight forward, it tends to be more exciting than studying some social history, it's pretty accessible, there's tons of material on it.  Most students have either seen a war movie or played video games so they have at least a working knowledge of some military history.  From a teaching perspective war chapters are cake.  \n\nI've also come to realize why my professors in college always seemed to hate teaching it: it gets old teaching the same battles over and over again, and the students of military history can be sort of pains the ass.  Not to overgeneralize but a lot of them over glorify war and arguing about trivia or utter minutiae without actually going in for deep analysis.

Different periods tend to be in vogue more than others; some eras such as the Crusades, fall of Rome still get a lot of works. Military history is popular as it provides an easy door into the historical world as many national, cultural and even religious identities are defined by conflict. \n\nHowever, I don't think military history is an lesser or greater than any history, the term itself itself is over broad; it isn't just reciting the names of battles, victors, weapons, and tactics. War has been a part of human history since the earliest records. Indeed, the earliest written \"histories\" and anthologies were mad de up of many war chronicles, which in part constitutes our modern perception of how history is written. These conflicts are microcosms of the ages and societies they portray and they can be viewed as defining moments in social, technological, cultural and economic trends.  In a way we are spoiled. We live in about the greatest era of relative peace in recorded history. Previous generations were enormously impacted by war and it became very important to defining their identities. In a period of peace, where generations have not known war in many countries such an attitude; to commemorate what was so much a part of their lives and political discourse, and the sacrifices that were made, what created out world may seem excessively \"glorifying\".  It was just who they were. If you were an Afghani historian - writing about war would be as much important to your world narrative as the civil rights movement to an American.\n\nIt is all about perspective, \n\nI dont like to think of one history as 'easier' or more \"professional\"; it reeks of snobbishness. Historians (as well as doctors, engineers, scientists, military branches) like to divide themselves into various groups including microhistorians, macro historians, social / family historians, genealogist and even archaeologist to name some of them. None are greater than the other and all contribute. Yet invariably there is always some kind of perceived pecking order.\n\nThat being said, the perception of military history as being \"easy\" or armchair, was largely generated because of a lot of it has been written about extensively; thus it is more in the public eye. Writing yet another book about Gettysburg or The Congress of Vienna, the Conquest of China just appears (and can be perceived as) as an unoriginal rethread where many others have gone on. It is thus viewed as less \"original\" or lacking in ground breaking merit. \n\nHistorians, as other academics, must publish or perish. Military history still sells quite well, but it will usually not get on published academically as readily as new take on a lesser known topic.  That is why many military histories are written more by professional writers, journalists, politicians and even the graduated armchair historian. Professional historians' on tenure or under pressure to provide renown and funding / grants / donations are most vulnerable to this. Sadly, this kind of parochial academic prostitution in endemic to all disciplines.\n\n"], [1, "As a fan of history you would like to know as much as possible about the events that formed civilization. As we are mostly looking at wars that have happened a long time ago where all who participated and all who knew anyone who suffered from it are gone I do not think it is unreasonable to be specially interested in such events and to study it objectively without judging the people of that time and without mixing in our modern values or morals.

If you spend all day looking at wars you'll end up looking at people like little plastic soldiers and the world like a RISK board.

What did the deployment do do communities, etc.\n\nIf anything studying history taught me not to get too cheery about glorifying anything - war, politicians, leaders, cultures etc.  After studying people, culture, and events deeply I found that a lot of glorified people/events in history had some very unsavory things about them.  There are a few venerated historical figures I have no use for.\n\nThe tone of Remembrance Day has changed over the years.

It's morphed today into something more like honoring the trial and sacrifice of our ancestors and glorifying them properly for their role in preserving freedom.\n\nI don't blame the small classes of professional(ish) historians for this trend towards a more muscular recognition of military events.  Especially since 9/11 we've seen an increasing militarization of things like police forces and even first responders like EMT's.  Three of my four grandparents are/were WW2 vets and I don't recall any of them wearing a stitch of camouflage clothing in civilian life.  A hockey team wearing a camouflage jersey to commemorate my grandparents has always felt a bit weird.

Individual battles, let alone actions within battles, are hardly ever talked about in a school setting and in university classes.\n\nThat's not to say that military history isn't fun, but the concrete way in which a war plays out is pretty meaningless in the grand scheme of things. By the time nations go to war, the winner has already been decided by their respective economic and political developments of the preceding years and decades. Sure, the guys at the helm tend to not know this, but in hindsight there are very few wars in the modern era that could have played out completely different...

A lot of my classmates were really into military history and so I thought I was just sort of fitting in.  And besides, it was fun: battles, weapons, etc.  \n\nAs I've gotten older, and actually started teaching history, I've realized that military history is fun because it's easy.  It's straight forward, it tends to be more exciting than studying some social history, it's pretty accessible, there's tons of material on it.  Most students have either seen a war movie or played video games so they have at least a working knowledge of some military history.  From a teaching perspective war chapters are cake.  \n\nI've also come to realize why my professors in college always seemed to hate teaching it: it gets old teaching the same battles over and over again, and the students of military history can be sort of pains the ass.  Not to overgeneralize but a lot of them over glorify war and arguing about trivia or utter minutiae without actually going in for deep analysis.  It only takes looking at that one kid who thinks that playing Halo or Call of Duty makes him fit to join the SEALS and who's going on and on about how awesome war is and how if he were in charge WWI would have lasted 5 minutes and wait a second does he have a Hitler mustache...ahem.

Perhaps simple to teach because curriculum in a lot of schools is, \"Here, teach these dates.\" However, I've found war history to be far more comprehensive than just battles, dates, and war machines. Personally, I always found war history to be boring in school because it was always, \"Who\", \"What\", \"When\", and \"How.\" I always thought \"Why\" was far more important and deserved way more attention. To understand the \"Whys\" of a war you usually need to read into much of the history prior to the official declarations. The socioeconomic factors, political climate, cultural tensions. These things often go much further back, especially in regards to Europe which has a very deep history with many cultures. In war, you can also learn a lot about how different cultures value life, view their enemies, biases, human nature. I personally think there's way more to learn from war than just the war itself and sadly it's neglected when talking about or teaching war history.\n\nAnd to OPs point. I don't think celebrating an anniversary is necessarily glorifying war. In the U.S. June 6th and December 7th are big war memorial days, but it never turns into a celebration of war.

", "id": "d6e0f2d"}, {"comment": "Hi! \n\nIt looks like you are talking about the book *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by *Jared Diamond*.\n\nIt is probably good to know that modern historians and anthropologists are quite critical of, if not borderline/outright hostile to, *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. Put bluntly, historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history that, in the end, paradoxically supports the very racism/Eurocentricism he is attempting to argue against. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [\"just so stories\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.\n\nFirst, **Diamond notoriously cherry-picks data that supports his hypothesis while ignoring the complexity of the issues.**\n\nIn his chapter \"Lethal Gift of Livestock\" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) on his hand-picked All Star team could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. Diamond ignored the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. \n\nAlso, he cherry-picks history when discussing the conquest of the Inca.\n\n> Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.\n\nThis is just patently false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling \"game over.\" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were \"conquered\", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological \"advantage\", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, but Diamond doesn't mention that complexity. The Inka were conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered, and technology reigns supreme in Diamond's narrative. \n\nThis brings us to a second issue: **Diamond uncritically examines the historical record surrounding conquest.** \n\nPizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts, like Diamond seems to do, you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.\n\nFinally, **the construction of the arguments for GG&S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world-wide in general, as categorically inferior**. \n\nTo believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.\n\nInstead of *GG&S* try:\n\n- Restall *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*\n\n- Mann *1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus*\n\n- MacQuarrie *Last Days of the Inca*\n\n- And if you would like to hear more about infectious disease spread after contact...

Different periods tend to be in vogue more than others; some eras such as the Crusades, fall of Rome still get a lot of works. Military history is popular as it provides an easy door into the historical world as many national, cultural and even religious identities are defined by conflict. \n\nHowever, I don't think military history is an lesser or greater than any history, the term itself itself is over broad; it isn't just reciting the names of battles, victors, weapons, and tactics. War has been a part of human history since the earliest records. Indeed, the earliest written \"histories\" and anthologies were mad de up of many war chronicles, which in part constitutes our modern perception of how history is written. These conflicts are microcosms of the ages and societies they portray and they can be viewed as defining moments in social, technological, cultural and economic trends.  In a way we are spoiled. We live in about the greatest era of relative peace in recorded history. Previous generations were enormously impacted by war and it became very important to defining their identities. In a period of peace, where generations have not known war in many countries such an attitude; to commemorate what was so much a part of their lives and political discourse, and the sacrifices that were made, what created out world may seem excessively \"glorifying\".  It was just who they were. If you were an Afghani historian - writing about war would be as much important to your world narrative as the civil rights movement to an American.\n\nIt is all about perspective, \n\nI dont like to think of one history as 'easier' or more \"professional\"; it reeks of snobbishness. Historians (as well as doctors, engineers, scientists, military branches) like to divide themselves into various groups including microhistorians, macro historians, social / family historians, genealogist and even archaeologist to name some of them. None are greater than the other and all contribute. Yet invariably there is always some kind of perceived pecking order.\n\nThat being said, the perception of military history as being \"easy\" or armchair, was largely generated because of a lot of it has been written about extensively; thus it is more in the public eye. Writing yet another book about Gettysburg or The Congress of Vienna, the Conquest of China just appears (and can be perceived as) as an unoriginal rethread where many others have gone on. It is thus viewed as less \"original\" or lacking in ground breaking merit. \n\nHistorians, as other academics, must publish or perish. Military history still sells quite well, but it will usually not get on published academically as readily as new take on a lesser known topic.  That is why many military histories are written more by professional writers, journalists, politicians and even the graduated armchair historian. Professional historians' on tenure or under pressure to provide renown and funding / grants / donations are most vulnerable to this. Sadly, this kind of parochial academic prostitution in endemic to all disciplines.\n\n", "id": "d6dujgr"}, {"comment": "Hi!   \n\nIt seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false \"winners write history\" trope! \n\nIt is a very lazy and ultimately harmful way to introduce the concept of bias. There isn't really a perfectly pithy way to cover such a complex topic, but much better than winners writing history is *writers* writing history. This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have \"lost\" the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus, but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within (or at least sympathetic towards) that order, and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.\n\nOf course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is, each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What did the deployment do do communities, etc.\n\nIf anything studying history taught me not to get too cheery about glorifying anything - war, politicians, leaders, cultures etc.  After studying people, culture, and events deeply I found that a lot of glorified people/events in history had some very unsavory things about them.

It's morphed today into something more like honoring the trial and sacrifice of our ancestors and glorifying them properly for their role in preserving freedom.\n\nI don't blame the small classes of professional(ish) historians for this trend towards a more muscular recognition of military events.  Especially since 9/11 we've seen an increasing militarization of things like police forces and even first responders like EMT's.  Three of my four grandparents are/were WW2 vets and I don't recall any of them wearing a stitch of camouflage clothing in civilian life.  A hockey team wearing a camouflage jersey to commemorate my grandparents has always felt a bit weird.  I'd chalk those trends up to reaction to 9/11 and the general social effect of the Harper government who quite actively funded things like War of 1812-1815 commemorations - I don't recall a single War of 1812 commemorative event from my earlier life.", "id": "d6d9umx"}], [{"comment": "can you give some modern examples of history buffs glorifying war?

", "id": "czs1bqy"}, {"comment": "I was alive during those blue years.  There is a lot more complexity than simply putting something on a graph, and I'll look at the index closer later.  I don't really trust this handy dandy graph.  \n\nThe effects of automation were foretold and realized by the mid to late 80s.  You also have to consider the changing nature of the economy itself.  What people manufactured, how they did it, and where that took place has more to do with it than any possible Executive-led tax incentives.  \n\nThe real reason is that American workers became far less valuable during those years than they ever had been.  No single factor accounts for this, and this only seems to be a controversy in political discussions.  \n\nThe widely accepted answers to Americans' high standard of living in the Post WWII era are:  \n\nThe destruction of the world's manufacturing and economic base.  The US had around 1/2 of the world GDP in the late 1940s.  Everything that worked was made in the US, with corresponding demand for workers.  \n\nIndustrial technology during this time demanded a lot of semi-skilled labor.  While factory-line workers don't need educations, they need to be employed for years to be most valuable, with a subsequent stabilizing effect on wages.  This applies to office workers, white-collar decision-makers, etc.  This also accelerates the next factor.  \n\nCollected bargaining.  At this time, while Unions *did* win worker rights and an increase in wages and conditions, co-operation between unions and employers was at an all time high because both benefitted from regular, stable labor bases.  \n\nThe rise of the Consumer Economy, especially automobiles.  The US essentially invented the modern consumer culture, and while the USSR was busy building steel plants and coking ovens, the US was turning out Bel Airs, refrigerators, and fashionable garments at a very high rate.  This led to financing, banking, and other value-added jobs which only accelerated growth.  \n\nReal Estate.  The invention of the 'Levittown' and suburbs employed a large segment of the economy in construction and infrastrucure who otherwise would not have been needed to maintain apartment buildings and cities.  \n\nThe list really goes on.  Post-War America, while Americans had always been relatively rich as remarked upon by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War, saw by far the peak of middle-class and working class incomes.  There was really no way for the rich to be any richer.  They were as gilded as the JP Morgans and Rockefellers and Vanderbilts of old, but not really any more.  Jet travel was really the only defining feaure of the 'rich' class, as they simply had fancier things, and more of them, that most Americans of the day could now afford.  Of course, well all have *much* more than the Americans did then.  I am dirt-broke poor and I have a laptop, smartphone, some nice clothes, and reasonable health care.  While much is made of 'gap', there is NO QUESTION that most of the world today considers necessities things that were only dreamt of in the 1950s. \n\nIt's a complex issue and I don't like that graphic.  \n\nThe other side to the era of he low wage gap is the inefficiency.  This was the age when everyone who was adult had a car, they bought a new one every 3-5 years, drove it everywhere, threw everythign away, consumed vast amounts of energy for inefficiently-insulated homes and low-technology cars, consumed fringe farmland at an alarming rate, built roads and parking lots and shopping malls all over the place, cut down forests and planted single-species lawns, and spent a truly staggering sum on the Cold War.  A very rich population means a very active economy.  And an active economy means consumption, waste, use, and all of the negatives that go along with it.  \n\nA 'clean' modern world where everyone is productively employed at high wages with low pollution and growing green spaces and re-cultivated farmland does not exist.

Mao actually ended sectarian warfare that had been going on for decades. He brought peace and stability to the modern borders of China, a feat which hadn't happened for quite a long time. He harnessed the immense natural resources and enormous population into an economy that has turned into the US's biggest competitor. His initiatives basically improved the standard of living for everyone in China across the board."], [3, "I'm just going to copy/paste a comment I made in another discussion about Mao:\n\nLife expectancy increased DRAMATICALLY under Mao - the fastest increase in human history. How does that square with the GLF famine? Well here's what people don't get when they drop the \"but Mao caused the deaths of X million people!\": famine was NORMAL in China before unification (as it is in all backward, feudal, agricultural societies that are chopped up into various rival warlord regimes - India was no picnic either back then nor is Somalia today). Famine was and is something that happened at least every 10-20 years but nobody gave a shit because it wasn't \"communist.\" Before collectivization while the country had been unified things hadn't changed much in terms of the productive capacity of Chinese agriculture, which was still quite backward. Just because your government changes doesn't mean all of a sudden peasants have access to modern farming equipment and chemical inputs.\n\nThe GLF was supposed to address that and it actually wasn't a total failure - note that it was the LAST famine in China, despite a major drought and fuckups in planning that were half reasonable choices given what they knew at the time and based on fairly reasonable projections based on the previous two harvests (hindsight is a bitch) but also half wishful thinking based on local officials juking the stats (which they should have realized were bullshit).\n\nWhat resulted was an increase in mortality in the hardest hit areas but given China was a population of 800 million people at the time even a very slight increase in mortality is going to mean millions of dead because every year millions die of just regular causes. The higher estimates of the death toll tend to be based on population projection where they take the population estimate (of dubious accuracy) from before the GLF and then the population estimate from after the GLF and compare that to what the expected population would have been given the birthrate (which is assumed to be static even though birthrates can change for all sorts of reasons, including urbanization which was happening as well). The difference between those quite arbitrary numbers is then said to have \"died under Mao.\" But if the birthrate dropped at all (which it did) then all of a sudden we have millions of \"dead\" that it turns out were never even born in the first place.\n\nSo what actually happened? It's tricky because a lot of Sinology in the West is still heavily influenced by the Cold War meanwhile in China the current leadership is from the faction that opposed Mao back in the day so while they can't openly reject him (it would be like the President of the USA saying \"fuck George Washington!\") they have no interest in promoting any kind of objective scholarship and would rather just gradually shift the memory of Mao to a bland, uncomplicated nationalism."], [19, "For the economy, you should take a look at [China's Five Year Plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China). These were general economic plans made by the Communist party, as was also done in the USSR. As the firm leader of the party for most, if not all, of the period from 1949-his death in 1976, he definitely had substantial influence in most or all of the FYPs. Read it yourself, but the way I see it, the figures show that many of them did pretty good jobs in raising industrial output and to some extent, agricultural growth, succeeding despite some problems it created for the greater economy (e.g. industry stripping agriculture). Notably, the first five year plan which the Soviets helped with, along with the stuff Mao and friends were doing between 1949 and its conception, really helped to secure China's economic base from the crappiness of the previous 100-150 years. \n\nThe exception to this would be the 2nd FYP, also known as the great leap forward, mentioned by other comments here. This was a disaster that caused a massive famine in China. It is surely notable, but be careful not to allow your judgement of Mao to be overly based on a single salient, despite being major, event. Those are the facts which should be sufficient to form your own opinion on Mao's role in the economy.\n\nSocially, Mao turned his gaze against the intellectual class for most of his leadership, notably in the [Hundred Flowers Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign) and the Cultural revolution. The latter event saw much more than just intellectuals dying, and created massive instability such that no one really knew what was going on. It also turned art into blatant propaganda and a personality cult tool, and of course religions were oppressed.\n\nHowever, Mao did pretty good things in terms of general education, making Primary education more accessible, introducing vernacular Chinese writing and the pinyin system, all of which contributed to increased literacy rates. \n\nAs far as women's issues go, I hesitate to say that he did only good things for women. On one hand, he helped to break strong Chinese traditional family sentiments. He got women working, affirmed marriage equality and banned practices of female prejudice such as foot binding and infanticide. But this, combined with his other policies regarding collective labour in the communes really broke apart families. He divided men from women and had them eat in canteens with their workmates rather than with their families, with children in daycare. I'll leave it to you to decide where to stand on that.\n\nInternationally, another user mentioned that he did get China on the world map by helping North Korea. This is true, China's prestige rose to being a great power, the only one in Asia, during the Cold War. China's prestige was great enough that the US saw fit to try and use them against the Soviets, who saw them as a threat since the growing Sino-Soviet split of the late 1950s. Mao also helped China become a nuclear power in 1963, though he largely failed to export China's brand of Communism as an alternative to the Soviets, an endeavour that cost China a lot of money for little gain. The biggest example was of how China and the USSR were competing to win the loyalties of North Vietnam, with China eventually pulling support during the Vietnam War and later fighting a war against what was by then Communist Vietnam.\n\n\nLast thing I'd like to say is that I saw someone here post a wiki article on Mao: The Unknown Story for more information. I'd take whatever's in there with a pinch of salt. Jung Chang, one of the authors, has had a bad experience living in China which probably clouded her opinions to some extent. Her views are largely regarded as traditionalist, and should be read in conjunction with other more contemporary books on Mao which offer different views. I'd post links, but my days in history class with its reading lists are too far behind me to remember any of them ><"], [5, "\"It's evident that Mao's intentions were good\"\nodd statement if you ask me.

This drove Mao to set far too high production goals, followed shortly after by the Great Leap, which failed terrifically, due to poor policies such as the eliminate the 4 pests campaign and the steel production policies.\n\nIf you want to learn more specifically about Mao, I would really recommend Pantsov and Levine's biography on Mao; it provides a more detached and scholarly examination of his life and rule, certainly better than Jung Chiand's Mao the Untold Story."], [2, "The positive?

It is tempting, but let's address the content of the question and practice suspended disbelief for a moment.  The revolution in China led to the elevation of millions from poverty.  Costs be damned, the people of China today have clawed out a proletariat, and they are a major force in terms of industrial capacity.  Russia's revolution had incalculable costs too, but Russians today are better for it.  Nikita Khrushchev was born a peasant.  So was Mao, (his father was a 'rich peasant' [w/e that means; think kulak].  The fact that peasants could ascend to be heads of state of some of the most powerful states in the world is a glaring testament to the power of Marxist revolutions in the last century.  Millions of Chinese (and Russians) who would have surely spent their lives as peasants had the attempts at industrialization not been attempted.  The assumption that modernity would have eventually crept up is pure speculation.  Contemporary Chinese workers are still exploited, but the non-agrarian workers have disposable income and consumer goods to buy now.  I'm not even sure Mao is the responsible party for the gains of the revolution.  Perhaps the gains were an inevitable result of popular discontent?

He did many, many terrible things. However, I think most of the posts in here cover those terrible things in great detail. So, I will add one insight that could possibly be seen as a \"good thing.\"\n\nSimplified Chinese was standardized during his reign. Its standardization boosted the literacy rate of China tremendously. IIRC, the literacy rate was far greater than the US's, hovering over 90%. \n\nBut things have changed in recent years. Overall, the Chinese education system has improved greatly which questions the necessity for a simplified Chinese platform. When I lived in China and spoke with locals about simplified Chinese and the opinion I largely received was that they wish they knew (or were taught) traditional Chinese instead as the meaning and history of the word is more vivid in traditional Chinese and lost in simplified Chinese. Many times I even heard envy about Taiwan, which still teaches and uses traditional Chinese.\n\nSo take that how you want it. I think that arguably one of Mao's greatest accomplishments is coming into question, which will essentially leave him with nothing."]], [[{"comment": "Why is it evident that Mao's \"intentions were good\"?", "id": "d1kb23v"}, {"comment": "He gave the Chinese people respite from the suffering of life by killing them", "id": "d1kwyrf"}, {"comment": "Dr. Kevorkian before it was cool.", "id": "d1l7b00"}, {"comment": "Confirmation bias?", "id": "d1kbcts"}, {"comment": "I'm biased to think OP should do his own history homework assignment.", "id": "d1kfc4x"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d1kj2u2"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d1kyoir"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d1kcvnq"}, {"comment": "I thought the Cultural Revolution was mostly revenge on people who challenged him during the Great Leap Forward (something like 30 million dead from famines), or trying to shift the blame. \nWas it also because he was he was losing grip on power?

According to Marx, all societies were destined to evolve from agricultural to industrial, and from the industrialized society would rise the proletariat -- the inevitably oppressed working class would revolt and bring to bear the communist socialist state. \n\nThis had arguably happened in Russia, and Mao wanted the same for China. But China was still mostly agricultural -- there was no proletariat to rise up! He determined to accelerate the inevitable march of history, and thereby hasten the rise of the socialist and classless society in his country, by compelling it to transform into an industrialized one. \n\nSo how did he do this? \n\nFrom John Lewis Gaddis' phenomenal book [\"The Cold War\"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Cold-War-New-History/dp/0143038273),\n\n>\"[Mao] ordered farmers throughout China to abandon their crops, build furnaces in their backyards, and throw in their own furniture as fuel, melt down their agricultural implements \u2013 and produce steel.

Farmers had to suddenly collectivise, radically alter their farming methods *and* hit increasingly absurd new yield quotas. Yet the consistent official result was always not only success, but roaring success: highest crop yields ever, highest iron yield in the region, because success meant loyalty. Failure meant you weren't Mao-ing hard enough, and according to official broadcasts, every region but yours was doing super. \n\nWhen farmers couldn't hit their quota, that meant the local governor didn't hit his quota, which led to villages draining their rice stores and melting down their pots for iron. \nOn paper, it looked like a spectacular success, but at the ground level villages were stripping tree bark for food. The system was harsh on failure and officials were competitive with their quotas, so it totally incentivised lying and desperately important news wasn't being reported. The famine was well underway by the time the facts reached Beijing, or were acknowledged. Mao would retreat to his bedroom for days around this time.\n\nEven worse, this early misinformation period accelerated the famine.

How does that square with the GLF famine? Well here's what people don't get when they drop the \"but Mao caused the deaths of X million people!\": famine was NORMAL in China before unification (as it is in all backward, feudal, agricultural societies that are chopped up into various rival warlord regimes - India was no picnic either back then nor is Somalia today). Famine was and is something that happened at least every 10-20 years but nobody gave a shit because it wasn't \"communist.\" Before collectivization while the country had been unified things hadn't changed much in terms of the productive capacity of Chinese agriculture, which was still quite backward. Just because your government changes doesn't mean all of a sudden peasants have access to modern farming equipment and chemical inputs.\n\nThe GLF was supposed to address that and it actually wasn't a total failure - note that it was the LAST famine in China, despite a major drought and fuckups in planning that were half reasonable choices given what they knew at the time and based on fairly reasonable projections based on the previous two harvests (hindsight is a bitch) but also half wishful thinking based on local officials juking the stats (which they should have realized were bullshit).\n\nWhat resulted was an increase in mortality in the hardest hit areas but given China was a population of 800 million people at the time even a very slight increase in mortality is going to mean millions of dead because every year millions die of just regular causes. The higher estimates of the death toll tend to be based on population projection where they take the population estimate (of dubious accuracy) from before the GLF and then the population estimate from after the GLF and compare that to what the expected population would have been given the birthrate (which is assumed to be static even though birthrates can change for all sorts of reasons, including urbanization which was happening as well). The difference between those quite arbitrary numbers is then said to have \"died under Mao.\" But if the birthrate dropped at all (which it did) then all of a sudden we have millions of \"dead\" that it turns out were never even born in the first place.\n\nSo what actually happened? It's tricky because a lot of Sinology in the West is still heavily influenced by the Cold War meanwhile in China the current leadership is from the faction that opposed Mao back in the day so while they can't openly reject him (it would be like the President of the USA saying \"fuck George Washington!\") they have no interest in promoting any kind of objective scholarship and would rather just gradually shift the memory of Mao to a bland, uncomplicated nationalism.", "id": "d1kudgh"}], [{"comment": "For the economy, you should take a look at [China's Five Year Plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China). These were general economic plans made by the Communist party, as was also done in the USSR. As the firm leader of the party for most, if not all, of the period from 1949-his death in 1976, he definitely had substantial influence in most or all of the FYPs. Read it yourself, but the way I see it, the figures show that many of them did pretty good jobs in raising industrial output and to some extent, agricultural growth, succeeding despite some problems it created for the greater economy (e.g. industry stripping agriculture). Notably, the first five year plan which the Soviets helped with, along with the stuff Mao and friends were doing between 1949 and its conception, really helped to secure China's economic base from the crappiness of the previous 100-150 years. \n\nThe exception to this would be the 2nd FYP, also known as the great leap forward, mentioned by other comments here. This was a disaster that caused a massive famine in China. It is surely notable, but be careful not to allow your judgement of Mao to be overly based on a single salient, despite being major, event. Those are the facts which should be sufficient to form your own opinion on Mao's role in the economy.\n\nSocially, Mao turned his gaze against the intellectual class for most of his leadership, notably in the [Hundred Flowers Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign) and the Cultural revolution. The latter event saw much more than just intellectuals dying, and created massive instability such that no one really knew what was going on. It also turned art into blatant propaganda and a personality cult tool, and of course religions were oppressed.\n\nHowever, Mao did pretty good things in terms of general education, making Primary education more accessible, introducing vernacular Chinese writing and the pinyin system, all of which contributed to increased literacy rates. \n\nAs far as women's issues go, I hesitate to say that he did only good things for women. On one hand, he helped to break strong Chinese traditional family sentiments. He got women working, affirmed marriage equality and banned practices of female prejudice such as foot binding and infanticide. But this, combined with his other policies regarding collective labour in the communes really broke apart families. He divided men from women and had them eat in canteens with their workmates rather than with their families, with children in daycare. I'll leave it to you to decide where to stand on that.\n\nInternationally, another user mentioned that he did get China on the world map by helping North Korea. This is true, China's prestige rose to being a great power, the only one in Asia, during the Cold War. China's prestige was great enough that the US saw fit to try and use them against the Soviets, who saw them as a threat since the growing Sino-Soviet split of the late 1950s. Mao also helped China become a nuclear power in 1963, though he largely failed to export China's brand of Communism as an alternative to the Soviets, an endeavour that cost China a lot of money for little gain. The biggest example was of how China and the USSR were competing to win the loyalties of North Vietnam, with China eventually pulling support during the Vietnam War and later fighting a war against what was by then Communist Vietnam.\n\n\nLast thing I'd like to say is that I saw someone here post a wiki article on Mao: The Unknown Story for more information. I'd take whatever's in there with a pinch of salt. Jung Chang, one of the authors, has had a bad experience living in China which probably clouded her opinions to some extent.

People have written entire books on his successes. \n\nBasically, before Bismarck and Prussia started uniting Germany, German-speaking people were scattered into two large nations (Prussia and Austria) and a few dozen smaller states (Bavaria, etc). After 1871, there's suddenly a geographically large state, with a very large population, highly industrialized, under strong, stable leadership, that also happened to be located at the very centre of Europe. \n\nEdit typos"], [11, "That is an interesting question.\nUnfortunately, I cannot point you toward to much english literature on the topic, as I am German myself and there is little reason to not read it in my native language.\nIf you are able to understand German, try \"Ullrich, Volker, Die nerv\u00f6se Gro\u00dfmacht 1871-1918.

Of course they couldn't really retaliate too early, even though they were able to recover from the reparations they had to pay. \n\nEngland wanted to wait it out, because Germany didn't become a greater power until much later, when their economy almost surpassed that of Great Britian.\n\nAustria-Hungary was an ally to the Germans. Even though they were at war not even a decade before, the fact that the Kaiserreich was founded without the german-austrian parts annected meant that the two countries weren't really at odds with each other.

Each of these were short, and resulted in significant territorial and population gains for Germany. \n\nA big factor was the brilliant political leadership of Prussian (later German) Chancellor named Otto Von Bismarck. People have written entire books on his successes. \n\nBasically, before Bismarck and Prussia started uniting Germany, German-speaking people were scattered into two large nations (Prussia and Austria) and a few dozen smaller states (Bavaria, etc). After 1871, there's suddenly a geographically large state, with a very large population, highly industrialized, under strong, stable leadership, that also happened to be located at the very centre of Europe. \n\nEdit typos", "id": "d9obobj"}], [{"comment": "That is an interesting question.\nUnfortunately, I cannot point you toward to much english literature on the topic, as I am German myself and there is little reason to not read it in my native language.\nIf you are able to understand German, try \"Ullrich, Volker, Die nerv\u00f6se Gro\u00dfmacht 1871-1918. Aufstieg und Untergang des deutschen Kaiserreichs, Frankfurt 2013 pp. 26-29 or pp 74-88.\"\nThis is where most of my following assesments come from, however, if you want something more in lines of historical controversy, try \"Frie, Ewald, Das deutsche Kaiserreich (Kontroversen um die Geschichte), Darmstadt 2013, pp. 56-68.\"\n\nNow to the points: Firstly, France was utterly defeated in the war that preceded the founding of the Kaiserreich. Of course they couldn't really retaliate too early, even though they were able to recover from the reparations they had to pay. \n\nEngland wanted to wait it out, because Germany didn't become a greater power until much later, when their economy almost surpassed that of Great Britian.\n\nAustria-Hungary was an ally to the Germans. Even though they were at war not even a decade before, the fact that the Kaiserreich was founded without the german-austrian parts annected meant that the two countries weren't really at odds with each other. Additionally, even though it seems weird, both countries were headed by a \"Kaiser\", an institution of conservative, old values, and were therefore close in terms of ideology.\n\nNow the trinity of the three Kaisers (Germany, Austria, Russia) was not that much more than an ideological one, as at first they couldn't agree much on real political stuff. However, the Reichskanzler Bismarck bound Russia in a defensive \"alliance\" of sorts that meant both powers wouldn't intervene in any wars that were declared on the other, as tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary grew and the Czar feared that Germany would become involved on the Austrian side of things.

The Egyptians are noted by the ancient Greeks as being a very advanced culture.\n\nIt's mentioned in the article, but the main reason that the focus of most of our concept of the Greeks being the cradle of western science and math is because the writings left by the Greeks were easily translated to the cultures of the west. So it creates the superficial illusion that it is all coming out of Greece. They also mention the western bias of dismissing the source of things coming out of Africa due to racial bias, and I think that is very much secondary to the first explanation I made, since the Egyptians were highly regarded by western civilization, sometimes to the extreme of attributing mythical powers to them.\n\nSo I like the article, and it points out that Greece did not create everything from whole cloth.

It is such an ingrained thing in our culture at this point that it's been hard to shake. \n\nWe also attach personalities to the concepts with the Greeks. Plato and Aristotle and Pythagoras. Conceiving of an \"inventor\" is just such a neat and tidy way for humans to conceptualize things.  \n\nAnd, also, the Greek way of collecting and reporting data is closer to our own preferred method. The Egyptian and Babylonian concepts where acutely tied up in \"religion\" (religion is a bad word for it because of how we perceive religion to be tainted and faith based). Those concepts were correct and important (the Babylonian math discoveries have been mind boggling in my opinion) but they were still tied to the metaphysical. The Greeks really divorced these from the metaphysical and applied \"logic\" to it. Or, more accurately, we think of them as doing that.

It is known that Pythagoras went to Egypt to learn geometry. But he also picked up a lot of his learning from some other cultures. The Egyptians are noted by the ancient Greeks as being a very advanced culture.\n\nIt's mentioned in the article, but the main reason that the focus of most of our concept of the Greeks being the cradle of western science and math is because the writings left by the Greeks were easily translated to the cultures of the west. So it creates the superficial illusion that it is all coming out of Greece. They also mention the western bias of dismissing the source of things coming out of Africa due to racial bias, and I think that is very much secondary to the first explanation I made, since the Egyptians were highly regarded by western civilization, sometimes to the extreme of attributing mythical powers to them.\n\nSo I like the article, and it points out that Greece did not create everything from whole cloth.
