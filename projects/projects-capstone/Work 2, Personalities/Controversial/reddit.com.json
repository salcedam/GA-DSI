It's disappointing that your responses have so far been dull, ignorant Jew-baiting nonsense. \n\nThere are a large number of rightwing Christian zionists in the United States who support Israel because of bullshit religious reasons. A lot of ~~rightwing~~ politicians use support for Israel as a means of pandering to these voters. However the main impetus for the huge amount of US aid comes from the Camp David Peace Accords. Aid money to Israel (and Egypt, which also gets a significant amount of money, the main reason why the new regime is maintaining the treaty despite popular Egyptian opinion) was a carrot used by Carter to end decades of war. It resulted in the first peace treaty between Israel and an Arab nation. It is also a cold war relic which supplied the US with a proxy against Soviet influence in the middle east. \n\nThe reasons for the aid have obviously evolved over time, but you wanted to know why it was there 'in the first place.'

This comic is the very definition of political satire.  Read the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire) for satire or something, since it seems you have some sort of overly strict list of requirements for a work to be considered satire that just flat don't exist.\n\n> Doesn't humor usually derive from a disparity between observation and fact?\n\nI also don't understand where you get that idea.  Sure that is one form of humor, but humor comes in all forms and I would say that isn't even close to the most common.  Hell, pretty much all of stand-up comedy revolves around pointing out amusing anecdotes about the world around you, or pointing out otherwise unamusing anecdotes in amusing ways.\n\nIt sounds like you just have a much narrower view than most people in what you find funny, and that's fine.  However, humor is in the eye of the beholder and just because you don't find something funny or amusing does not mean you can declare it to be humorless.  I think the very fact that there is a 100+ comments from people who found this comic funny means you can't even claim that this is not funny, just that _you_ don't find it funny.", "id": "c2ssj3s"}, {"comment": ">However, humor is in the eye of the beholder and just because you don't find something funny or amusing does not mean you can declare it to be humorless.\n\nYeah I know, that's why I was asking what I was missing, this is obviously funny to others.\n\n>Hell, pretty much all of stand-up comedy revolves around pointing out amusing anecdotes about the world around you, or pointing out otherwise unamusing anecdotes in amusing ways.\n\nYes but the humor comes from the *way* things are observed which is most often not factually. No observational humor is funny if it is literal (That's when you end up with statements like: \"What's the deal with airline food, it's really awful.\" Yeah we know that's not comedy just fact). All observational comedy falls flat if you actually pick it apart and find the reasonable behavior behind the apparently absurd behavior (For example: \"Airline food is bad because because it is incredibly cheap and steamed via the heat from the plane's engines\" Now any humor that could have been there is dissipated).\n\nBut what I really meant is about the disparity between observation and given fact, a man notices someone acting in a way that is unusual or counter intuitive to a logical behavior and behold, hilarity ensues.\nOr even notices that standard practiced behavior is illogical or counter intuitive, the logical fallacy (aka disparity between observed behavior and expected behavior) is the humor.\n\nI think all humor can be reduced to expectation and having the opposite of those expectations fulfilled.\n\nTension and release.\n\n>Are you telling me you literally looked at the last panel and thought to yourself, \"I see, this comic is clearly describing a statement of fact often overlooked in the war on drugs through a parallel using dandelions. While logical, this is entirely devoid of humor due to the analogy only amounting to a straight-faced statement of fact.\"\n\nYes, that's why I wrote it.\n\nI do however find this conversation amusing.\n\nEdit: I think all of the replies to my comment would have been unnecessary if someone had just told me: \"You did get it, you just didn't find it funny.\"\n", "id": "c2stk2m"}, {"comment": "> Yeah I know, that's why I was asking what I was missing, this is obviously funny to others.\n\nWell I think at the time it was mildly funny, while also attempting to point out the absurdity in the \"just say no\" campaign (that's the political satire part).  Pointing out that overloading kids with warnings about drugs will have the opposite effect is not merely stating a non-novel statement of fact as you claim, otherwise we would have never had that stupid campaign to begin with.  Clearly to a large majority that idea is not only non-obvious, but some even rejected it.  I bet there were people that even took irrational offense to this comic.  \n\nEspecially to the reddit crowd, there is added humor in viewing this comic in hindsight.  I suspect you too are affected by viewing this message in hindsight, but for you it is lowering the humor rather than increasing it.  Looking back retrospectively at the point this comic is attempting to make about the \"just say no\" campaign, we have the benefit of hindsight that allows us to see this message as obvious.  \n\nTo you that has turned the comic from funny into merely pointing out a truth you accept so innately, you have trouble viewing it as anything but a mere statement of fact.  To the rest of us though, this adds humor by first causing us to think \"haha awesome, that guy got it from the start.\"  But then also of the depressing hilarity that even back then not only were there people who got it, but tried to warn others and yet the campaign charged on forward.\n\nComics are also not always supposed to be gut-busting funny, a large aspect of them their is character development and aesthetically pleasing artwork.  I never followed this comic, but I'm willing to bet that someone who knows this character would have the added humor in thinking \"ha! That's _just_ like so-and-so to do that!\"\n\n> No observational humor is funny if it is literal\n\nSee that is exactly what I was disagreeing with.  The stand-up comics I usually find the funniest are the ones that make me think, \"HA that's so true, that _does_ happen all the time!/they _do_ act like that in that situation!\"  A simple flat statement like \"What's the deal with airline food?  It's awful\" is indeed unfunny if flatly delivered in those words.  However, a good comedian could go on for an hour ripping on humans for wearing backpacks and have the crowd in stitches.  Especially if he ends by merely describing, exactly as it happened, a real life event from his childhood about a kid who would filled his backpack extremely full to save time while ignoring the warnings of those around him.  Only to end up falling backwards and being unable to get up as everyone busts up laughing.  A factual story told exactly as it happened and was observed, but extremely funny if delivered half-way decently.  \n\nEven if you are saying that someone merely stating commonly known facts is never funny, I still don't buy it.  I bet a good comedian could compile a list of facts that would make people laugh out loud when read one after the other in order.  I guess you could still say the comedy is in the delivery if you consider the order they are put the delivery, but then at what point does the delivery become disjointed from the content?\n\nI also don't know why you think a comedian must rip apart the reasons _why_ an absurd behavior happens, this comic certainly didn't do that.  If you are saying all observational comedy becomes unfunny to the listener if they were to pick it apart themselves, then uhhh don't do that?  I also don't buy that doing so would be inherently unfunny, sometimes the reasons why we do absurd behaviors are absurd and hilarious in themselves.  \n\n> But what I really meant is about the disparity between observation and given fact, a man notices someone acting in a way that is unusual or counter intuitive to a logical behavior and behold, hilarity ensues. Or even notices that standard practiced behavior is illogical or counter intuitive, the logical fallacy (aka disparity between observed behavior and expected behavior) is the humor.  \n>  \n> I think all humor can be reduced to expectation and having the opposite of those expectations fulfilled.\n\nWhat you describe is one _type_ of humor, and I'd agree you could boil down a lot of modern humor to fit that archetype.  However, you can't possibly think that _all_ humor falls under that archetype.  Think about any joke that has ever been told, that is based on a stereotype.  Someone telling a story their coworkers find humorous about how they nearly got hit by a little black Honda, and low and behold he looks over and it's an Asian women, is funny precisely because they had an expectation and that _exact_ expectation was filled.\n\n> Edit: I think all of the replies to my comment would have been unnecessary if someone had just told me: \"You did get it, you just didn't find it funny.\"\n\nExactly, humor is diverse, subjective, and entirely in the eye of the beholder.  Things also almost certainly cease to become humorous at the point where you have to break the down and analyze them.", "id": "c2svlzd"}, {"comment": "It's satire.

Yet today I consider this the luckiest subreddit on the face of Reddit. I have been in reddit's heart for five years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you readers.  \n  \nLook at these grand posts. Which of you wouldn\u2019t consider it the highlight of his reddit career just to associate with them for even one day? Sure, I\u2019m lucky. Who wouldn\u2019t consider it an honor to have known the 'Fuck Sears' post? Also, the creators of animation's greatest empire, Pixar showing Up to a dieing 10 year old girl? To have spent five years with that wonderful little fellow, Snoo? Then to have spent the next five years with outstanding leaders, that smart student of psychology, the best admins in Reddit today, hueypriest, spladugalienth, chromakode, bsimpson, intortus and kemitche? Sure, I'm lucky.  \n  \nWhen Digg, a website you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift \u2014 that\u2019s something. When everybody down to the mods and those boys in white coats remember you with karma\u2014 that\u2019s something. When you have a wonderful mod who takes sides with you in squabbles against their own subreddit\u2014 that's something. When you have a community who works so that you can have an education and build a body\u2014 it's a blessing. When you have a subreddit who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed \u2014 that's the finest I know.  \n  \nSo I close in saying that we might have been given a bad break, but we've got an awful lot to live for.

Who wouldn\u2019t consider it an honor to have known the 'Fuck Sears' post? Also, the creators of animation's greatest empire, Pixar showing Up to a dieing 10 year old girl? To have spent five years with that wonderful little fellow, Snoo? Then to have spent the next five years with outstanding leaders, that smart student of psychology, the best admins in Reddit today, hueypriest, spladugalienth, chromakode, bsimpson, intortus and kemitche? Sure, I'm lucky.  \n  \nWhen Digg, a website you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift \u2014 that\u2019s something. When everybody down to the mods and those boys in white coats remember you with karma\u2014 that\u2019s something. When you have a wonderful mod who takes sides with you in squabbles against their own subreddit\u2014 that's something. When you have a community who works so that you can have an education and build a body\u2014 it's a blessing.

There are no consequences if they lose. There are tremendous rewards if they win.

No bank actually has the cash on hand to liquidate all their accounts. This is why bank runs are so dangerous.\n\nIf a bank were liquidated extremely fast as happened in the bank runs in the Great Depression, the FDIC would still have to attempt to compensate for the money that the bank can't supply, and the government would essentially bail out a few investors, but by then the system already has a wrench in its gears.\n\nInstead, the \"bailout\" loans (it wasn't just a donation) were used to maintain the spread, and even made a profit for many banks.

In otherwords, if the banks F-up through their own actions, and some other entity bails 'em out, there's no sense that doing something wrong or stupid carries any consequences.  With the bailout, the government socialized the losses by taking on bank debt and privatizes profit.  Banks get to operate in a consequence free environment as a result.

It's absurd to socialize the loses but privatize the earnings."], [5, "Your question is ambiguous about what exactly is meant by \"letting the banks fail,\" because you don't specify if you mean *liquidation* or *reorganization*.  These are two forms of bankruptcy: in a liquidation, the business ceases to exist, all of its assets are sold off, and its employees are out of a job, whereas in a reorganization, its stockholders are wiped out, the creditors become the new owners, and the business keeps ticking under new management.\n\nWhen it comes to the bank bailouts, there are four parties involved:\n\n* The financial businesses.  By this I mean primarily the corporations, their directors, management, employees and assets.\n* The stockholders of the financial businesses.\n* The government, who provides money for the rescues.\n* The taxpayers, who finance the government; you could see them as the government's \"shareholders.\"\n\nThe bailout that we've had is, basically, the government stepping in to rescue the financial businesses **and their stockholders** at the taxpayers' expense.  But the big problem here isn't the rescue of the businesses\u2014which is probably justified in order to help the economy\u2014but rather the rescue of the stockholders, who should have been wiped out for investing in a business that failed.  Rescuing the stockholders is letting them keep the rewards but put the risk on taxpayers.\n\nSo if by \"let the banks fail\" you mean let the **businesses** close down (i.e., liquidate), the answer is no, it would have been a lot worse if we'd let them fail.  If you mean reorganize them, then hell yeah, that would have been better.  The government would put up the money for keeping them afloat\u2014but then the government ends up as the owner, and sells the recovered businesses back in the market when the economy recovers."], [4, "You met me at a very strange time in my life."], [5, "There is nothing more possibly terrible and wrong than to go about the path we are now, and have been since the earlier days of England. The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel. We always hear about money going to foreign banks (specifically, around 80% of bail out money went to foreign banks). Who are these banks? Are they run by a sovereign nation? No. Are they run by a private corporation/families? Yes. \n\nThere is a reason no one on the media or anywhere for that matter are allowed to speak about WHO owns these foreign banks. The reason is because all Western media sources and many others through trickle-down-effect of reprinting the same story, are owned by these Foreign banking elite. The Rothschilds are the number one family in the world, estimated to be worth upwards of 500 trillion dollars. They downplay their wealth because people tend to get more educated, and true history will show that this is the case. The Federal Reserve is a Rothschild central bank modeled after the Central Bank of England, a private 'crown' corporation, who's shareholders are these private families. They are Ashkenazi Jews, very smart people. It's no wonder they are ahead of the masses in terms of control through things like the media. However, the internet is changing it all. Awareness is being spread around. People are starting to figure out what the Federal Reserve actually does. \n\nWhen you understand the implications of the Fed, it relates to everything else, including the power of corporations. The founding fathers knew about this power. They wanted the power of banking in the hands of the people, for once. This is why they are so respected. Andrew Jackson's entire presidency was to kill the private bank. They caused economic disasters and blamed it on Jackson. The people didn't know any better, and they really still don't for the most part.\n\n\"We have, in this country, one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board. This evil institution has impoverished the people of the United States and has practically bankrupted our government. It has done this through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it\". \u2014 Congressman Louis T. McFadden in 1932 (Rep. Pa)\n\nIf you let the banks fail, yes it will be problematic and manifest other problems that otherwise wouldn't exist. But it is a drastic moment for drastic change. It will be counterbalanced by the benefits of removing these useless corporate entities from power. Too big to fail? Too big to exist. \n\nSo what's the solution of the Fed. These are things to consider:\n\nShould the power of the control of a nation's currency belong to the people/Congress or should private currencies compete? The problem with the latter, is that these 'money changers' as they've been known as throughout history, corner markets with their established wealth, and drive prices up to as high as the market can bare.\n\nMy thoughts is that it should belong to the people/Congress. Support and promote transparency in government. Remove the Fed, expose the 'Foreign Banks/Rothschilds' cartel, educate and aware the people for a change, and perhaps Congress will have more faith from the people and it will work in this unprecedented age of technology and transparency.\n\n   \"Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.\" \u2014 James A. Garfield, President of the United States\n\nHistory repeats itself. The Rothschild aka \"Foreign Banking\" cartel has existed since the wars of France and England, with whom the Rothschilds backed England and helped defeat France. They made their wealth from loaning to governments since they were better investments to be backed by the tax payers. This system has gone no where. To this day, you will see documentaries and works around the world wide library about how almost all nations on Earth are subject to this debt-money scam. \n\n\u201cMoney is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal \u2013 that there is no human relation between master and slave.\u201d Leo Tolstoy, Russian writer.\n\nAnd you may wonder, if this is true why haven't the Rothschild's been exposed? Well besides hiding their wealth behind proxies, they also set up an entity called the Anti-Defamation League, which basically seeks to harass anyone who commits defamation or slander against Jews. This was created conveniently and coincidentally the same year the Rothschild's/foreign bankers set up the 'Federal' Reserve, in 1913. \n\nTherefore, anyone who attempts to relate global banking conspiracy/NWO/world government to Zionism or the Rothschilds than they are automatically attacked by the ADL and basically forced to keep quiet. \n\nA good introduction to the Federal Reserve is G. Edward Griffin's 'Creature from Jekyll Island: A 2nd look at the Federal Reserve. Also, 'Money Masters', 'The American Dream', talks about the Fed by Louis McFadden, JFK, the founding fathers (called it Central Banks), Milton Friedman, Ron Paul, etc. All great starting areas. \n\nAlso Central Banking isn't necessarily bad, but fractional reserve banking allows banks to create money continuously and make profits of it's interest, meanwhile attributing to serious inflation. \n\nIf there is a God, I hope it helps us all. World poverty would end in a year if the Rothschild/Foreign Banking system is exposed and ridiculous national debt owed to private families abolished.\n\nLet African nations print and issue and control their own currency. Let Canada. Let America. Let Europe. \n\nWho doesn't have a Rothschild bank? \n-Iran (stuxnet virus to shut down nuclear plants, enemy in media)\n-Afghanistan (failed state, NATO occupied)\n-Sudan (failed state)\n-Cuba (enemy in media, operation northwoods conspiracy)\n-Libya (a central bank has been set up by the rebels according to Western media.

It's up to experts (politicians, financial experts) to listen to what their electorate want and use their knowledge to do something about it.  I realize that I might be opening myself up to a comparison between OWS and anti-evolution anti-science laypeople who demand evolution be taken from the classrooms, but unlike difficult and sometimes counter-intuitive scientific subjects like evolution, I think the general machinations of society and political / economic power are pretty clear to experts and laypeople alike, even if laypeople cannot quite express the details in a way that covers all of the subtleties.  Ridiculously wealthy, powerful, and corrupt institutions and people are creating a society that does not serve the interests of most people.  That much is pretty clear.  \n\nTo the average person, including yours truly, \"bank\" is a catch-all term for institutions dealing in money, whether insurance giants, lending institutions, or banks that only offer deposit accounts.  Fact is most of us don't have time to learn the details of real hard economics, as it is an incredibly complicated discipline, and it would take full time learning over the course of years to really come to grips with its idiosyncracies.\n\nThere's an opposite tendency I notice, whereby experts become (for lack of a better word) desensitized to the bigger picture, or the dangers of things.  I found this in myself when I was taking my chemistry & biochemistry training - as I learned more about things like arsenate, ethidium bromide, pyridine, hydrofluoric acid, cyanide, etc, including working with them in the lab and learning about them in theory, I became desensitized to them - felt as though by virtue of my knowledge I had somehow conquered them.

Wish I could upvote you more than once.\n\nIt is plainly obvious that bailing out the banks or \"too big to fail\" creates a HUGE [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) and will only serve to make the rest of us poorer, and the rich richer.  The big banks are enjoying privatized profits and socialized losses to a massive degree.\n\nLetting the banks collapse is the ONLY way correct the massive imbalance, and fix our economy in the long run.  But thanks to our politics of high spending and high debt, that would now create astronomical problems for our economy.  Bank failure would cause credit to freeze, and the resulting deflation would be catastrophic for servicing the public debt.  \n\nThe only two options at that point.  One is outright default, which would send the globe into total and utter chaos.  It would force our government to balance its budget (because lending would halt completely), which would cause a deep depression, which further reduces government revenue.  The ensuing depression will be far worse than the Great Depression.  There will be LOTS of pain.  Good thing is, it would clear out almost ALL the malinvestments that have been built up over decades.  Those people who do have savings & capital will be able to invest in a VERY favorable environment where labor & commodities are dirt cheap.  Companies may actually start to manufacture in the US again.  The economy will quickly rebuild on very solid foundation.\n\nThe other option would be where Bernanke fights the deflation with money printing.  The Fed will start QE3, QE4, QEx and ensure the government will not technically default.  However this will cause massive price inflation which will torpedo the economy.  The failing economy would further reduce government revenue and force even more money printing.  Then we enter a hyperinflationary depression that completely destroys the currency, the economy, and possibly the government.  This happens over several years all while Bernanke and the politicians are trying to \"fix\" it.

As many people argued when TARP was being enacted, it should have included actual lending requirements, but it didn't.  TARP *should* have required the bailed-out banks to use the money to open up credit markets and thereby stimulate small business growth, but instead, it had no teeth at all and allowed the banks to instead use it to shore up their assets and prevent them from having to cut into profits.  While overall GDP has been propped up by this, actual societal well-being absolutely hasn't been.\n\nIf the banks had failed, things would be much worse in the sense that even the people at the top would be suffering.  Instead, people at and near the top have been able to cushion a substantial chunk of the blow, but the bailout was NOT structured in a responsible manner, meaning that the tippy-top was cushioned from all of the blow, and the cushioning barely trickled down to help out most of the top 10%.  It did not trickle down further.\n\nWhat this means is that, effectively, for most Americans, no bailout wouldn't have really left them much worse off than the bailout did.  For the wealthiest Americans, the bailout made a HUGE fucking difference.  So our GDP looks *okay*, but wealth inequality has actually gotten *worse*, which is worse for society in both the short term and the long term.\n\n>the \"bailout\" loans (it wasn't just a donation)\n\nI'm really tired of hearing people talk about how TARP was a loan and not a grant as though this ends the conversation.  Yes, it was a loan.  But it wasn't just any old loan.  It was a loan on more favorable terms than **any person or even any bank would have gotten from any other creditor in the world even under the best of circumstances**.  Like, you know how if you have a so-so credit rating, and you apply for a loan or a line of credit, how the bank will give you less than you might have asked for (if it gives you anything at all), and it will charge you a huge chunk of interest?  Like, these days, something around 20% APR or more?  The failing banks are like a would-be debtor with so-so credit, except that instead of getting only a tiny loan with shitty repayment terms, they got massively huge loans (and ask any financial analyst: those loans were *not* secured by proportionately valuable assets -- remember all the talk a few years back about toxic assets?  THOSE were the assets securing trillions in debt.  It was like getting a $500k mortgage secured by a crumbling, rotting shed sitting out on a swamp.  It's something NO HUMAN PERSON WOULD EVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS EVER GET FROM ANY CREDITOR) with some of the most favorable loan repayment terms known to mankind.\n\nTHAT'S why people call it a bailout.  Because it was a **FUCKING BAILOUT**.  There is no way that those kinds of loans were financially justified under any kind of standard credit rating decision.  They were as close to gifts as a loan can be without being a flat-out handout.  They were \"loans\" the way it's a \"loan\" if your parents pay for your college and tell you you're supposed to pay it back someday, without interest, if and when you get a job.  Yes, technically, it got paid back, as back in the day when college graduates could get jobs they often managed to pay back their folks for helping with school.

But the big problem here isn't the rescue of the businesses\u2014which is probably justified in order to help the economy\u2014but rather the rescue of the stockholders, who should have been wiped out for investing in a business that failed.  Rescuing the stockholders is letting them keep the rewards but put the risk on taxpayers.\n\nSo if by \"let the banks fail\" you mean let the **businesses** close down (i.e., liquidate), the answer is no, it would have been a lot worse if we'd let them fail.  If you mean reorganize them, then hell yeah, that would have been better.  The government would put up the money for keeping them afloat\u2014but then the government ends up as the owner, and sells the recovered businesses back in the market when the economy recovers.", "id": "c2srcqn"}], [{"comment": "You met me at a very strange time in my life.", "id": "c2srhdr"}], [{"comment": "There is nothing more possibly terrible and wrong than to go about the path we are now, and have been since the earlier days of England. The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel. We always hear about money going to foreign banks (specifically, around 80% of bail out money went to foreign banks). Who are these banks? Are they run by a sovereign nation? No. Are they run by a private corporation/families? Yes. \n\nThere is a reason no one on the media or anywhere for that matter are allowed to speak about WHO owns these foreign banks. The reason is because all Western media sources and many others through trickle-down-effect of reprinting the same story, are owned by these Foreign banking elite. The Rothschilds are the number one family in the world, estimated to be worth upwards of 500 trillion dollars. They downplay their wealth because people tend to get more educated, and true history will show that this is the case. The Federal Reserve is a Rothschild central bank modeled after the Central Bank of England, a private 'crown' corporation, who's shareholders are these private families. They are Ashkenazi Jews, very smart people. It's no wonder they are ahead of the masses in terms of control through things like the media. However, the internet is changing it all. Awareness is being spread around. People are starting to figure out what the Federal Reserve actually does. \n\nWhen you understand the implications of the Fed, it relates to everything else, including the power of corporations. The founding fathers knew about this power. They wanted the power of banking in the hands of the people, for once. This is why they are so respected. Andrew Jackson's entire presidency was to kill the private bank. They caused economic disasters and blamed it on Jackson. The people didn't know any better, and they really still don't for the most part.\n\n\"We have, in this country, one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board. This evil institution has impoverished the people of the United States and has practically bankrupted our government. It has done this through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it\". \u2014 Congressman Louis T. McFadden in 1932 (Rep. Pa)\n\nIf you let the banks fail, yes it will be problematic and manifest other problems that otherwise wouldn't exist. But it is a drastic moment for drastic change. It will be counterbalanced by the benefits of removing these useless corporate entities from power. Too big to fail? Too big to exist. \n\nSo what's the solution of the Fed. These are things to consider:\n\nShould the power of the control of a nation's currency belong to the people/Congress or should private currencies compete? The problem with the latter, is that these 'money changers' as they've been known as throughout history, corner markets with their established wealth, and drive prices up to as high as the market can bare.\n\nMy thoughts is that it should belong to the people/Congress. Support and promote transparency in government. Remove the Fed, expose the 'Foreign Banks/Rothschilds' cartel, educate and aware the people for a change, and perhaps Congress will have more faith from the people and it will work in this unprecedented age of technology and transparency.\n\n   \"Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.\" \u2014 James A. Garfield, President of the United States\n\nHistory repeats itself. The Rothschild aka \"Foreign Banking\" cartel has existed since the wars of France and England, with whom the Rothschilds backed England and helped defeat France. They made their wealth from loaning to governments since they were better investments to be backed by the tax payers. This system has gone no where. To this day, you will see documentaries and works around the world wide library about how almost all nations on Earth are subject to this debt-money scam. \n\n\u201cMoney is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal \u2013 that there is no human relation between master and slave.\u201d Leo Tolstoy, Russian writer.\n\nAnd you may wonder, if this is true why haven't the Rothschild's been exposed? Well besides hiding their wealth behind proxies, they also set up an entity called the Anti-Defamation League, which basically seeks to harass anyone who commits defamation or slander against Jews. This was created conveniently and coincidentally the same year the Rothschild's/foreign bankers set up the 'Federal' Reserve, in 1913. \n\nTherefore, anyone who attempts to relate global banking conspiracy/NWO/world government to Zionism or the Rothschilds than they are automatically attacked by the ADL and basically forced to keep quiet. \n\nA good introduction to the Federal Reserve is G. Edward Griffin's 'Creature from Jekyll Island: A 2nd look at the Federal Reserve. Also, 'Money Masters', 'The American Dream', talks about the Fed by Louis McFadden, JFK, the founding fathers (called it Central Banks), Milton Friedman, Ron Paul, etc. All great starting areas. \n\nAlso Central Banking isn't necessarily bad, but fractional reserve banking allows banks to create money continuously and make profits of it's interest, meanwhile attributing to serious inflation. \n\nIf there is a God, I hope it helps us all. World poverty would end in a year if the Rothschild/Foreign Banking system is exposed and ridiculous national debt owed to private families abolished.\n\nLet African nations print and issue and control their own currency. Let Canada. Let America. Let Europe. \n\nWho doesn't have a Rothschild bank? \n-Iran (stuxnet virus to shut down nuclear plants, enemy in media)\n-Afghanistan (failed state, NATO occupied)\n-Sudan (failed state)\n-Cuba (enemy in media, operation northwoods conspiracy)\n-Libya (a central bank has been set up by the rebels according to Western media.

And contrary to some of the nutters out there, burning it all to the ground (and then doing nothing, expecting magic to take care of it, or intentionally building a randian dystopia from the ashes, depending on who you ask) isn't the solution.\n\nWe don't torch our houses and then build a new one when the roof leaks.  We don't replace our cars when a tire goes flat.  We don't rip out every traffic signal and sign in town when some drunken yahoo gets in a wreck, and we didn't dismantle the internet because somebody created a virus.  We fix the problems.  So why is government any different?\n\nIt's not.\n\nIf the republic is to survive, if society is to heal, we've got a lot of work to do.

It is however a nasty chicken-and-egg scenario...those able to do the repairs are also at the heart of the problem, and most are unwilling to sacrifice their careers and put a strong, stable society first.  When some entities are more equal than others, we get corruption.  Return logic, reason, and pragmatism to the world of business...as long as business leaders are expected to gamble with the company's future, the gambling will continue.\n\nFinancially, we've condoned excessive risk.  By privatizing the profits and socializing the losses, we encourage economic gambling...bet the farm all the time because there's no repercussions (as long as your company's big enough to have 'friends' in congress).  Rather than focusing on and rewarding steady, sustainable operation we've sold investors on the idea of the ever-increasing return.  Log ago have logic and reason been abandoned in favor of clinging to the idea that prices [in this case, price per share] will only ever go up and only ever accelerate in its rate of climb.\n\nSound familiar?  It should.  It's the same thing that got us into the housing debacle.  'If you ever can't pay your loan, just sell the house and turn a profit!  You've got nothing to fear!  Prices will never decrease!'\n\nWithout well-regulated markets [in quality of regulation, meaningfulness of penalties, and even-handedness of enforcement], our economy will remain unstable.  So long as real wages remain stagnant, the foundation of our economy will continue to erode, and eventually it'll come toppling down anyway when the discretionary dollar is right up there with Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy as figments of the imagination.\n\nAnd so long as money and politics are allowed to intermingle, we'll have the best government money can buy...a plutocracy, a nation where fitness to lead (and in a dystopian version, even availability of basic rights) is determined by net worth.  So long as money and politics are allowed to intermingle, the attitude will remain 'to hell with the dirty peasants...if they didn't want to be treated like peasants, they shouldn't have been born peasants!'\n\nThe ballot box has failed us, America.

That's not to say that just joining a Credit Union and ditching a commercial bank will solve the problems that large commercial banking firms cause (what with speculative investing and all) but to even compare a Credit Union to a Bank in terms of them being evil and money grubbing is ignorant at best, and plain idiotic at worst.\n\nI suppose some of the very basic, important differences should be noted:\n\nCredit Unions are not-for-profit organizations.  They exist solely to provide services to their members. For just about all Credit Unions, Member Service is the NUMBER ONE GOAL.  You could essentially call any person with a single dollar held at a Credit Union a \"Shareholder\".\n\nBanks are for-profit, with their only allegiance being to shareholders. All actions are expected to show a profit.  You are not number 1 in the Bank's eyes. You're probably not even number 10.

There is no corporate interest controlling decisions of a Credit Union. You have a say, as you are a part owner.\n\nCredit Unions are also heavily invested in increasing the quality of the community in which they are located.

Keeping the cash spread around is a good thing. If everyone uses a neighborhood credit union, and only one of them makes some crappy loans based on derivatives and no proof of income, as a country we can let it go under without creating a massive bail-out program; one that we *HAVE* to make because we all stuck our eggs in one basket. \n\nCase in point, the CU I was with didn't give out any high risk loans from 2003-2006, and actually took some heat from members for missing out on a lot of business. They also took flak for holding every loan 100% through the end instead of breaking up payments from bank-to-bank to spread around the risk. They responded in a letter to members that they aren't here to make a big profit. We're here to make sure members have their money when they need it, have access to borrowing loans based on the community's collective credit rating, and would meet interest promises based on everyone paying back the loans they'd made. As a money sucking whore at the time? I was fuming. The tirade was noteworthy. \"Only in Portland would a group of bankers turn down money!\" (I'm cleaning that up..my mom is probably watching).\n\nFlash forward to 2009, they (I should say we)..WE were in better shape than a lot of banks. We never rode the crest of the wave, but we sure as hell didn't get caught in the trough either. I remembered that letter our CU President (that I dumbly voted AGAINST during re-election) wrote to the members a couple years prior, and cooly waited for a simple post-it note saying \"told you so.\"...It never came though. I wish it had. I would have framed it and put it on my wall.\n\nOn top of that? I have a mortgage. I have 6 months worth of payments saved. I also lost my job, and didn't get a new one for 7 months. I know I know, Suze Orman says I need a year. I didn't have a year ok? I really like beer and my battle.net account.\n\nI wound up a month behind on my payments. I called the number for the person responsible for maintaining my loan, and told them what was up. She credited me the compounding late fees, threw another 200 bucks on my monthly payments until I was caught up, and waived the extra interest.\n\nTotal time to execute? Around 10 minutes, and she finished by referring me to a head hunter. She'd check in from time to time, to see if I was surviving. She was watching unemployment hit my account, and wondered if I was able to keep the lights on, or if I needed to throttle back the payment to 50-75 bucks until I got more cash. 5 months later, she called me and told me I was caught up, grats on the new job, and thanked *ME* for my business. \n\nSo why a CU instead of a bank? You tell me.\n\n", "id": "c2srxns"}, {"comment": "For me and my wife its just personal experience of beyond terrible customer service and no support from them.

That's not to say that just joining a Credit Union and ditching a commercial bank will solve the problems that large commercial banking firms cause (what with speculative investing and all) but to even compare a Credit Union to a Bank in terms of them being evil and money grubbing is ignorant at best, and plain idiotic at worst.\n\nI suppose some of the very basic, important differences should be noted:\n\nCredit Unions are not-for-profit organizations.  They exist solely to provide services to their members. For just about all Credit Unions, Member Service is the NUMBER ONE GOAL.  You could essentially call any person with a single dollar held at a Credit Union a \"Shareholder\".\n\nBanks are for-profit, with their only allegiance being to shareholders. All actions are expected to show a profit.  You are not number 1 in the Bank's eyes. You're probably not even number 10.  Decisions are all made by highly paid executives, influenced by wealthy investors (other corporations) with the customer's interest rarely taken into account.\n\nJust that comparison there should be enough to clue anyone in as to why a Credit Union should be your first choice.  Look at Bank of America and their $5 dollar debit card fee.  In the Credit Union world, an idea like that would be absolute lunacy.  Fees and income from a Credit Union essentially get cycled back to the Members in the end, through services and rates.  The Credit Union in which I bank and work offers free checking, free online banking, free mobile banking, free coin counting machines, free shared service center usage (out of state), free telephone banking, free bill pay etc etc.\n\nAt a CU, The Board of Directors are volunteer, voted upon by the Membership.  There is no corporate interest controlling decisions of a Credit Union. You have a say, as you are a part owner.\n\nCredit Unions are also heavily invested in increasing the quality of the community in which they are located.  This ties directly with the not-for-profit status.

She then remembers she has a potion somewhere that fortifies her marksman skill and drinks that, trying again, hitting the target and noticing that \"this is much better\". She then talks to her dog again, noticing that he must be hungry because he is so grumpy. She fetches and throws him a chunk of deer meet which he happily eats. He then appears to be much happier and starts to roam about. Eventually, he becomes too active for her taste, so she paralyses Thunder with a spell. She sits down to read a book - moving her finger over the lines and turning the pages - and to eat and eventually decides to hit the hay herself, all in fluid motion.

When he was dead we were able to kept the antlers, which we would no doubt have displayed in our house as soon as we'd bought one in one of the cities.\n\u25a0We were able to look at characters' facial expressions without cringing at the old engine. They\u2019re much improved, and suspicious looks from a town leader's bodyguards work brilliantly with the dialogue to set a mood that we should mind our Ps and Qs.\n\u25a0We dual-wielded magic. It's possible to have two of the same spell or even different spells mapped to the triggers.\n\u25a0We went swimming in a river and almost fell down a big waterfall, and let out an audible gasp when we climbed to safety.\n\u25a0We caught Riverbetty fish and Salmon while swimming with our bare hands.\n\u25a0We waited in the middle of a field just to see the day/night transition unfold before your very eyes. It was much like Shenmue II.\n\u25a0We went to the nearest city and took a carriage to a city that was further away. It could take us to any of the game\u2019s cities \u2013 even the ones we hadn\u2019t been to.  \n\u25a0We heard people shout for help in the wilderness in a fashion not dissimilar to Red Dead Redemption, except instead of needing to be defended from outlaws, they\u2019re running from dire wolves or Orcs. Or dragons. \n\u25a0We stared in awe at the mist around mountains. It looks phenomenal. \n\n\u25a0We went into someone\u2019s house and were asked politely to leave. Then firmly. Then they started calling for the guards. So long, old RPG tropes!\n\u25a0We were happy to see that the \u201cover-encumbered\u201d message was gone, replaced with \u201cYou are carrying too much to be able to run,\u201d which, crucially, still allows you to move, only very slowly.

He'd seen us too. Run!\n\u25a0We spent 20 minutes riding from one spot on the map to another. Skyrim is freakin' humongous, and much of it in wide-open areas populated by mammoths and giants. \n\u25a0We learned the difference between riding on the road with a horse (they can gallop at full-speed) and riding in the hills on a horse (they can only trot, never building speed). \n\u25a0We fell off a cliff with our horse several times. Most of the times it killed us, but once we saw our character slowly climb to his feet and continue after a particularly unfortunate fall.\n\u25a0We were amazed as we rode through shallow water with a horse. Water ripples are brilliantly rendered in real time, and look straight out of a Pixar movie.\n\u25a0We had the horse shot out from under us. Enemies will always attack your steed first before they start attacking you. Once your horse is down... you ain't goin' nowhere, son.\n\u25a0We mistakenly hit the wrong button to jump, because it\u2019s now mapped to A, which is where it always should have been.\n\n\u25a0We collected glow worms called \u201ctorchbugs,\u201d which fly around. But sadly, collecting them kills them (and butterflies too) and adds their thoraxes and wings respectively as ingredients for alchemy in your inventory. Shame. But they look lovely while they're alive.\n\u25a0We cried about killing torchbugs. \n\u25a0We spent several minutes looting a large laboratory of ingredients. \n\u25a0We crafted the crap out of potions. Once we found an Alchemy bench we filled out inventory with alchemical potions. \n\u25a0We found Nirnroot. Hey! Nirnroot is back!\n\u25a0We learned which ingredients do what. Snowberries and Silverside Perch resist frost; Dragon's Tongue and Strawberries both resist fire; Deathbell and Bleeding Crown both contain weakness to poison. When we mixed Snowberries, Silverside Perch, and Dragon's Tongue we created a Potion of Resist Frost. \n\u25a0We also tried to improve our weapons using Grindstones, but we didn\u2019t have any of the ingredients.\n\u25a0We swung our axe at the Grindstone in frustration \u2013 it bounced off. \n\u25a0We tried to talk to a Ghostly Headless Horsemen, but he wouldn\u2019t have a conversation with us despite having a \u201ctalk' prompt.\u201d Presumably, because he doesn\u2019t have a mouth. That, or he\u2019s a rude bastard.\n\u25a0We mistakenly alerted guards as we tried to sneak up on them by bumping into bones dangling from ropes on the ceiling. They made a clattery noise and we jumped. \n\u25a0We passed a stone column with a sword, shield, and flowers laid at its base. We left them well alone.\n\u25a0We enjoyed talking to NPCs without time freezing around us. Talking to people is a much more organic process, happening in real-time.\n\u25a0We reloaded a previous save because an NPC wouldn\u2019t progress the quest.

Or there was an enemy stuck in it. \n\n\u25a0We hit a guard in the head with a mace and got thrown in jail.\n\u25a0We tried to pick the lock in our jail cell but failed, breaking the one lockpick we snuck in.\n\u25a0We broke out of our cell by smashing through a crumbing wall, and then took back our stuff and fought our way out .\n\u25a0We saw some giants standing around and went to talk to them. They didn\u2019t want to talk to us. Way to perpetuate the stereotypes, guys.\n\u25a0We drank a potion and entered into an NPC\u2019s memories.\n\u25a0We talked to a salty sea captain who lost his sea salt in a sea cave. \n\u25a0We overheard a conversation about women in a town having horrid nightmares, and were given a side-quest to help end them.\n\u25a0We randomly attacked a ship\u2019s captain, hoping the crew would join in our coup.\n\u25a0We weren\u2019t all that surprise when the crew didn\u2019t join in our coup. \n\u25a0We jumped off the boat into the water, and swam away from out failed coup. \n\u25a0We walked in snow so thick we could barely see where we were going.\n\u25a0We read the letters in our inventory, which are 3D and unfold as you select them, revealing their written contents realistically written on the paper, not just as screen text. \n\u25a0We had some epic battles thanks to the new combat. Holding down the attack button does a charge attack in both senses of the word. Not only will the blow be more forceful, our Argonian also ran forward several steps before delivering the attack. \n\u25a0We missed several powerful swings of our weapon. The lunge is easy to miss, though if it was too easy, the move would likely be overpowered. If you do hit, however, it knocks the hell out of them. \n\n\u25a0We saw a fox while we were running through the forest. Quickly, we turned to it and used our magical ability to light it on fire. We actually laughed out loud and said \u201cHeh, Firefox.\u201d\n\u25a0We leveled up and spent our skill to improve our magical abilities. It turned our small flame attack into a full-blown flamethrower. \n\u25a0We swung a mace at a wolf and hit it so hard it rolled down the side of a hill for nearly a minute. It was a big hill.\n\u25a0We were randomly attacked by a woman while passing a village, but the only reason we noticed it was because we heard a \u201ctwang\u201d and saw an arrow fall to the ground after striking a rock.\n\u25a0We overheard people talking about a recent attack, though they didn\u2019t go into details. \n\u25a0We found a cave in the middle of nowhere filled with traps.\n\u25a0We tried to explore the cave, but were killed by the traps.\n\u25a0We tried to explore the cave again, but were killed by zombies after being weakened by the traps.\n\u25a0We decided that the cave sucked and was for losers and didn\u2019t go back.\n\u25a0We went to the cave again and cleared it, earning awesome new items and gaining a ton of experience.\n\u25a0We walked into a city we saw an executioner preparing to bring an axe down on a man\u2019s neck.

That's what Jamie needed.  People even found partners at this group.  He could have found that boyfriend!  \n\nI have depression and anxiety and Jamie's blog mirrorred my own thoughts when outside influences of my life were causing me so much mental pain, I actually did want to end things.  It actually felt like physical pain.  It's unbearable.  To me, thoughts of suicide felt akin to someone with chronic physical pain choosing to die, rather than to live with pain. \n\nThe ONLY thing that took away this pain was SUPPORT.  I went to see councillors and psychologists, just like Jamie.  It does feel better to talk to someone about your problems, but the psychologists and councillors cannot FIX your problems.\n\nI am an adult, so I can find out where I need to go and figure out what I have to do to get the support I need.  I have complete control over my life.  If someone harasses me at work, I have control over getting that person to stop.  In highschool, nobody gives a shit.  You're just supposed to take it.

However, there are people who are depressed because of external influences.  These people may NEVER need medication.  I am hoping that Jamie's doctor knew what he was prescribing, because there definitely seems to be more than sufficient evidence to indicate that his depression may have been from external influences.

While i'm not discounting counselling services, etc... it's an \"Adult\" solution, not a \"teenager\" solution. A lot of these counselling services don't do a lot other than reinforce negativity that they live every day. They don't need more adults telling them whats wrong... they already know what the fuck is wrong.\n\nWhat kids and teenagers really need is an outlet.

However, there are people who are depressed because of external influences.  These people may NEVER need medication.  I am hoping that Jamie's doctor knew what he was prescribing, because there definitely seems to be more than sufficient evidence to indicate that his depression may have been from external influences.

Not really. I mean sure, it's an entertaining read and has a certain appeal to the adolescent mind with its \"talented child genius called upon to save the world\" theme (see also Harry Potter series), but as *literature* it's dime novel pulp stuff, thoroughly non-compelling and really not all that cleverly written. If you read Card's original short story *Ender's Game*, it's more obvious just how much meaningless **filler** he shoveled into it to stretch it to book length--- all the stuff with his siblings on \"the nets\", the pointless random dreamland phlosophy of the computer simulation world, etc. The original story was just ENDer at battle school, then commanding the human fleet to victory, then a few generals afterwards verbally musing whether it was truly *moral* for adults to be using up children as weapons like that--- basically Card not being sure he'd belabored the point sufficiently, so he spelled it out for us in case we're stupid. Thing is, it's a pretty cheesy moral, and his execution is fairly weak to boot. Nothing Ender did in battle school was actually all that clever. Card apparently couldn't devise any **truly** interesting tactics, so he just had the other teams act like complete idiots, then have the instructors *gush* over the genius of Ender when he won by being slightly less stupid. Then he makes the inexplicable leap that a child showing (supposed) tactical genius can be thrown into a position of *strategic* command and somehow translate the same facility into victory. Anyone with a modicum of military experience knows the two are almost wholly dissimilar. On top of it all, he describes prepubescent **children** as developing muscles, reflexes, and intellectual capacity that the nature of human biology dictates is impossible. It *maybe* might have been possible with them as teenagers when they started, but 7 yr old Bean as a squad leader under 10 yr old Ender as platoon leader? Complete nonsense. 7-10 yr old children simply don't have the **capacity** for such development, as such development is *absolutely dependent* on the associated physical development of puberty. Then again, if Card had made them teenagers, it would have ruined his melodramatic \"adults using children as weapons\" theme.\n\nSo no, *Ender's Game* isn't literarily great. It's entertaining, sure, but it lacks any sophisticated philosophical depth and the raw execution is weak. I think a lot of introverted nerdy guys read it at an age where they strongly identified with Ender, themselves feeling like unpopular, unrecognized geniuses. I certainly felt that way in my youth. I didn't read the book then, though, I read it 10 years later, as a 24 year old  sergeant in the Army. As a result I saw *Ender's Game* for what it is. It boggles my mind that the USMC has put *Ender's Game* on their OCS reading list. Its value to people in the **real military** is nil. There's a thread of \"improvise to changing conditions\" throughout the book, which the USMC likes to emphasize, but the book offers no particular insight into *how* to improvise. Card basically just says \"Ender thinks outside a very simplified box and wins again\".", "id": "c2sr76w"}, {"comment": "No one here is putting Ender's Game on the same level as Infinite Jest, Ulysses or The Odyssey, but it is a definitely a book I would recommend everyone read. You seem to have missed most of the points of the book (yes adults using children as weapons is one among many) and dwell on some things that need not be dwelled on.\n\n\nHis siblings: Interestingly enough, Peter and Valentine become possibly MORE important than Ender in the grand scheme of things and are not 'thrown in as filler.' They are major characters for the remainder of the series.\n\n\"the nets\" which you brush off as pointless are possibly the most genius thing Card puts in the book, as it IS a science fiction book. The book was published in 1985 and he predicts the importance and omnipresence of the internet (not to mention tablet computers) with remarkable accuracy. Message boards, chatroom, news rooms, moderators, editors, its all there 10 years before any of it really becomes available.\n\nThe ideal of its value to \"real military\" is pointless. It was not written as some sort of strategic volume it is a story written for 17 year olds. It IS however, a great way to introduce new soldiers and new officers (who start training when they are 17...) to the importance of relying on each other and gaining the trust of your fellow soldiers and yeah, it talks about thinking outside the box -- simple boxes are doubly important to think outside of (and often the most difficult).\n\nIt also brings into moral light the total destruction of the buggers and whether this was a move that was legitimate.\n\nYour points about children not being able to do such and such are pretty meaningless -- these are supposed to be super-children, fed, bred, and taught to be super human almost from birth. The earth is so overpopulated everyone can only have 2 children and these kids are like the 200 smartest people in the world (out of probably something like 20 billion).

AND it made Ender feel like crap. And when he actually understood the Bugger he sought to undo his harm. Likewise with the buggers, they almost wiped out mankind due to their misunderstanding.\n\nHowever Hitler, a grown man, sought to wipe out the Jews, who never posed a threat to humanity, by his own free will and was never sorry for it.

I didn't see anywhere about it being ghost written, and I've read enough of Card's work to say that it wasn't. Many of the parallels are a stretch or meaningless. And nothing is cited which makes it difficult to judge the claims. She said that Ender had an almost insect-like love for Valentine. Nowhere in the book does does it even hint at that. That was just a desperate attempt to draw parallels to Hitler. Besides, Ender was like 10 years old. Give me a break. I say, let's forget about all these isolated comparisons. Why don't we look at what real issues people have with Ender's Game. For some reason it rubs some people the wrong way when they read about some perfect in nearly every way kid killing yet not doing anything wrong. So how about this. Your life is in danger by some crazy killer. Is it ok to defend yourself by killing him given the chance? I say yes. She's making the Jew/Bugger comparison, yet the scenarios in Ender's Game and the Holocaust are totally different. She claimed that Novinha was blamed for her own abuse in Speaker. I've read Speaker and this is simply not true. Her complaints about how the science fiction in the book was out there, well guess what, it IS science fiction. And she was actually put of by Jane's existence. It annoyed her that Jane spent her time talking to a man, much less Ender. And it annoyed her that Jane didn't have any woman parts. You see where this is going? Well I don't. There might be a couple insignificant isolated facts that parallel Ender and Hilter, just like every other character in existence. For example I share the same birthday as Selphie Tilmitt from FFVIII. Anyways the author of that article thinks that Ender's Game resonates with people because it tells them that their suffering makes them special and gives them a righteous reason to destroy their enemies. Yet in Ender's Game he only does what he needs to to stay alive. I think she's annoyed that Orson Scott Card even could suggest the existence of such an awesome person as Ender.\n\nIn war you crush your enemy and you don't play fair in order to protect yourself and everyone you care about.

I am sure that his politics were more extreme later in his life, and that he had a laundry list of plot points and characters to insert to make the (terrible) sequil somehow relevant.\n\nI brought it to your attention because I found it amusing that there was a serious discussion that Card used a ghost writer.

I think events are very easy to explain by drawing a paralell to George Lucas and his re-release of Star Wars. To sum up in two words: Cash In. Novellas don't sell for much money. Writers get paid (roughly) by the word. The novelisation of what is arguably the best thing Card ever wrote made exponentially more money than the novella. The following (increasingly crap) books were a nice little earner for a professional writer.\n\nCard is a tool. His work has become less relevant and of a lower standard with every passing year.

Rodriguez allegedly said \"that if there was any heat he would take it,\" at which Goss purportedly \"laughed and said that actually, it would be he, [Goss], who would take the heat,\" but Goss said that he \"agreed with the decision\" nonetheless. Id. Rodriguez then allegedly said that \"heat from destroying is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain - be said that out of context, they would make us look terrible; it would be 'devastating' to us,\" a sentiment with which \"[a]ll in the room agreed.\"** Id\""], [76, "The government has always been above the law.\n\nYou just noticed?"], [59, "Someone on Omegle asked me this morning.\n\n\"HOW ARE YOU AMERICANS NOT OUT RIOTING IN YOUR STREETS?!?!\"\n\nI don't have an answer, do you?"], [57, "Here's a [less crazy source](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/10/cia-dodges-contempt/).

Sure, there's a tiny little fraction of the organization that still has government oversight, but MOST of the organization is an international crime syndicate which uses the grey areas of international law to murder and steal.  We found this out when Oliver North was put on trial and his superiors testified in Congress in the 80s.  It's on YouTube, you can watch the dudes lay it all out.  They maintain their own army, navy, and air force.  They deal drugs and arms to raise money for their operations.  And it is entirely a 'black' organization, with absolutely no legal oversight whatsoever.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that the US government is too afraid to come out and excommunicate the CIA, shut down the tiny piece still attached to the government, and help hunt down and kill all of the CIA agents around the world breaking international law on a daily basis.  Most of what they do is secret, but we know enough to make one thing conclusively clear - they are the single most widespread and active enemy of democracy on the planet.  They rigged the elections in Afghanistan so poorly that the whole thing had to be thrown out, just so they could get Karzai in there so they could manipulate him through his brother, and retain control over the opium trade.  They rigged elections in Iraq.  They rigged elections in Haiti.  They kill candidates they don't think will serve US interests.  Killing everyone so that every nation in the world ends up with a pro-US leader is NOT democracy.  It is the most cynical rejection of democracy.  It is saying 'we know democracy can never work.  We know democracy is a joke.  The only way to get ahead is stomping on babies and robbing the innocent.\n\nThe real sick part is that most of the public inherently agrees.  They think the idea of a government controlled by the general public is patently insane.  They think everyone is so stupid that it would be guaranteed to collapse into utter chaos, and thinking it could work is a ridiculously naive pipe dream.  They think it's all a nice illusion that is only maintained by men in the shadows \"making the hard choices\" and feeding puppies into paper shredders to make the illusion of civility possible.  These are some of the most dangerous views in the world today.\n\nOh, and the CIA admitted a few years ago that all of Vietnam was their fault.  They wanted America to go to war in Vietnam, so they made up the Gulf of Tonkin incident, lied about it to the world, and tricked the politicians into going to war.

Dec!. of Constance E. Rea, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't of Def., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 271 'U~ 12-14) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10,2008). Apparently, the videotapes were retained in the field, without physically having been transferred to the OIG and without otherwise having been sent to headquarters. Id.; see also Dec!. ofAlicia L. Bannon, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't ofDef., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 450, Exs. 41-42) (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2011). Nor can I say that the individuals who destroyed, or who approved the destruction, of the videotapes, were aware of court orders requiring identification or production of the videotapes. However, the lapses ofindividuals cannot excuse the failures of the Agency. The CIA, qua agency, had the obligation to identify or produce the videotapes, and the CIA cannot be excused in its dereliction because of particular individuals' lapses.\n\n**Basics of the decision** It is true that the interrogation videotapes, having been destroyed nearly six years ago, cannot now be produced. But the CIA has remedied that failure by a massive production of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 documents-records that deseribe the contents ofthe videotapes, corresponding in time to their creation, and records that relate to the videotapes' destruction, in particular, the persons and reasons behind the destruction, corresponding in time to both the videotapes' creation and destruction. Plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate whether those records, or any of them, are exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption I or 3 or must be produced.\n\n**Summary** \"The measure ofthe court's power in civil contempt proceedings is determined by the requirements offull remedial relief.\" McComb, 336 U.S. at 193. Because plaintiffs already have achieved substantial remedial relief and would be entitled to no further relief if I were to find the CIA in civil contempt, I deny plaintiffs' motion to hold the CIA in contempt.\n\nAlso, I would like to add this case is being appealed. I am sorry, but I fail to see how this decision makes *\"US government above the law\"*\n\nMy personal opinion? I don't totally agree with the court, but I see how it came to its conclusion.

Sure, there's a tiny little fraction of the organization that still has government oversight, but MOST of the organization is an international crime syndicate which uses the grey areas of international law to murder and steal.  We found this out when Oliver North was put on trial and his superiors testified in Congress in the 80s.  It's on YouTube, you can watch the dudes lay it all out.  They maintain their own army, navy, and air force.  They deal drugs and arms to raise money for their operations.  And it is entirely a 'black' organization, with absolutely no legal oversight whatsoever.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that the US government is too afraid to come out and excommunicate the CIA, shut down the tiny piece still attached to the government, and help hunt down and kill all of the CIA agents around the world breaking international law on a daily basis.  Most of what they do is secret, but we know enough to make one thing conclusively clear - they are the single most widespread and active enemy of democracy on the planet.  They rigged the elections in Afghanistan so poorly that the whole thing had to be thrown out, just so they could get Karzai in there so they could manipulate him through his brother, and retain control over the opium trade.  They rigged elections in Iraq.  They rigged elections in Haiti.  They kill candidates they don't think will serve US interests.  Killing everyone so that every nation in the world ends up with a pro-US leader is NOT democracy.  It is the most cynical rejection of democracy.  It is saying 'we know democracy can never work.  We know democracy is a joke.  The only way to get ahead is stomping on babies and robbing the innocent.\n\nThe real sick part is that most of the public inherently agrees.  They think the idea of a government controlled by the general public is patently insane.  They think everyone is so stupid that it would be guaranteed to collapse into utter chaos, and thinking it could work is a ridiculously naive pipe dream.  They think it's all a nice illusion that is only maintained by men in the shadows \"making the hard choices\" and feeding puppies into paper shredders to make the illusion of civility possible.  These are some of the most dangerous views in the world today.\n\nOh, and the CIA admitted a few years ago that all of Vietnam was their fault.  They wanted America to go to war in Vietnam, so they made up the Gulf of Tonkin incident, lied about it to the world, and tricked the politicians into going to war.

Dec!. of Constance E. Rea, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't of Def., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 271 'U~ 12-14) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10,2008). Apparently, the videotapes were retained in the field, without physically having been transferred to the OIG and without otherwise having been sent to headquarters. Id.; see also Dec!. ofAlicia L. Bannon, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't ofDef., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 450, Exs. 41-42) (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2011). Nor can I say that the individuals who destroyed, or who approved the destruction, of the videotapes, were aware of court orders requiring identification or production of the videotapes. However, the lapses ofindividuals cannot excuse the failures of the Agency. The CIA, qua agency, had the obligation to identify or produce the videotapes, and the CIA cannot be excused in its dereliction because of particular individuals' lapses.\n\n**Basics of the decision** It is true that the interrogation videotapes, having been destroyed nearly six years ago, cannot now be produced. But the CIA has remedied that failure by a massive production of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 documents-records that deseribe the contents ofthe videotapes, corresponding in time to their creation, and records that relate to the videotapes' destruction, in particular, the persons and reasons behind the destruction, corresponding in time to both the videotapes' creation and destruction. Plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate whether those records, or any of them, are exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption I or 3 or must be produced.\n\n**Summary** \"The measure ofthe court's power in civil contempt proceedings is determined by the requirements offull remedial relief.\" McComb, 336 U.S. at 193. Because plaintiffs already have achieved substantial remedial relief and would be entitled to no further relief if I were to find the CIA in civil contempt, I deny plaintiffs' motion to hold the CIA in contempt.\n\nAlso, I would like to add this case is being appealed.

The CIA argues that procedures already ordered by the court have resulted in a substantially full production of documents describing that which the videotapes would have shown and identifying Agency personnel involved in the videotapes' destruction; that the same court-ordered exemptions that justified the CIA's withholding of many of those documents would have justified the withholding of the videotapes, as well, if the CIA timely had identified the videotapes in response to my orders; that the CIA voluntarily has adopted and implemented new protocols to avoid the improper destruction of documents in the future; and that, as a result, plaintiffs already have achieved substantially complete remedial relief.\nI hold that plaintiffs have, indeed, achieved nearly complete remedial relief, and I deny plaintiffs' motion, except for awarding plaintiffs their attorneys' fees and costs.\n2", "id": "c2ssek8"}, {"comment": "I.

Comp!., Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't ofDef., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No.5 '\\12) (S.D.N.Y. july 6, 2004). With those initial requests, plaintiffs sought the disclosure of government records that fell into three overlapping categories: (I) \"records concerning the treatment ofindividuals apprehended after September II, 200I, and held by the United States at military bases or detention facilities outside the United States\"-individuals otherwise referred to as \"detainees\"; (2) \"records concerning the deaths of [d]etainees in custody\"; and (3) \"records concerning the government's practice of 'rendering' [d]etainees to countries known to use torture.\" Id.; Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't of Defense (\"ACLU 1\"),339 F. Supp. 2d 501, 502 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).

But, as I explained,\nbefore it can be determined if documents requested . . . fall under [FOIA disclosure exemptions for records classified as matters of national defense or foreign policy], the documents must first be identified, by some form of log, to enable a specific claim of exemption to be asserted and justified. As to documents the existence of which the government contends it may be unable to confirm or deny, procedures can be established to identifY such documents in camera or to a special master with proper clearance.

The government elaborated:\nOrdinarily, the CIA is statutorily exempt from searching operational files for documents responsive to FOIA requests.

First you are comparing a deployment of 100 US soldiers to a 175,000 person army. Second, although Saddam was a detestable villain, he was a sovereign head of state, recognized by world courts. Third, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Joseph Kony, while the UN refused to countenance the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nRemember, also, that politics is the art of the possible. The concept of precedent is only useful to level charges of hypocrisy during debates. Precedent does not play a factor in international affairs.

Specifically, I am writing this using comparisons to Pacific Southwestern American English. For a refresher, [this](http://web.ku.edu/~idea/northamerica/usa/california/california4.mp3) is how we talk out here.\n\nThe \"upside down e\" sound is called a schwa. There is no equivalent in Japanese, correct. However, in any instance where an English word is transliterated into Japanese, the English spelling is typically used as the basis for spelling in Japanese (exceptions occur when the schwa is at the end of the word). For example, the word \"bottle\" becomes \"botoru\", where \"o\" represents the schwa, but in the word \"about\", it becomes \"abauto\" (schwa remains \"a\" in Japanese). Establishing this, we can agree that there is no equivalent for the schwa in Japanese.\n\nHowever, in the video, the error in pronunciation is not occurring due to the missing empty vowel in words like \"w\u0259rk\". Using Japanese pronunciation conventions, he would either try to replace the \u0259 with either \"o\" (r**o**w) or \"u\" (**u**ber), resulting in either \"work\" (rhymes with \"dork\") or \"wurk\" (I couldn't think of a word. Maybe the **u** in \"Tuna?\"]). \n\nHowever, we do not hear either of these in the video. The closest phonetic representation I can muster is \"wook\" (remember, Pacific Southwestern American).

So no matter which English letter they are saying, to your ear it sounds like they are saying the \"wrong\" one.\n\nTo make matters worse, they can't hear an \"R\" vowel modifier (\"er\", \"or\" \"ar\") at all.  They only hear \"R/L\" as a hard consonant at the beginning of a syllable (Ra, Ri, Ru, Re, or Ro).  When borrowing foreign words, the typical practice is to extend the \"a\" vowel sound slightly instead.  (So the word \"batter\" would be pronounced, \"bataa\".)\n\nSo \"work\" becomes \"waak\"* unless they either learn to speak a Western language fluently as a child, or are given A LOT of speech therapy coaching.\n\n(Edit:  *If speaking with other Japanese people, it actually becomes \"waaku\", because all Japanese syllables end in a vowel sound, but when attempting to actually speak English, as opposed to using borrowed foreign words, they typically learn to drop those trailing vowels that don't come from the original word.)", "id": "c2u9g9n"}], [{"comment": "Siri uses English\nJapanese is confused\nIt's super effective ", "id": "c2srq5v"}], [{"comment": " I think what they did was great with Siri but there are still a lot of problems that aren't going be fixed in the foreseeable future.

Don't know if the guy in this video is Japanese, but it sounds like the same issue/dynamic - just repeating the same mispronunciation like he can't even hear or comprehend what he's doing wrong.  In the various countries I've been in, I've often mispronounced something the first few times, but I listen more carefully and then make an effort to dial it in.  That has never failed.
