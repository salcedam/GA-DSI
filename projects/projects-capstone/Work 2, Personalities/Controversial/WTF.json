Any historian who has studied modern communism from its ideological origins in Karl Marx and Moses Hess, through the mass dispossession, forced starvations, and Gulags of the 20th century, is aware that communists are the real world champions of mass murder.  There is no historical dispute that communist regimes killed many times more innocents than any other regime in history, including Hitler's Germany.  But unlike members of that National Socialist regime, the greatest mass murderers of all time have not been hunted down across the face of the Earth.  They have not faced trial for their horrific crimes against humanity.  Perhaps even more importantly they have never faced the court of popular revulsion.  Why?  Because these communist perpetrators have been shielded by their tribal brethren who have an inordinate influence on media, academia and governments. The truth about the Jewish supremacist role in the creation, execution, and maintenance of world Communism, and the 'Russian' Revolution in particular remains little-known.  The reason for this is simple: The Jewish supremacist tribalists who influence major media in the West make sure that almost nothing is said about the fact that Jews, along with organized Jewish support worldwide, not only created Communism, but were the leaders who brought it into such grim reality.

The typical first aid advice is, if they're not breathing call the emergency services immediately, if they are breathing but don't rapidly regain consciousness and responsiveness (I believe 'rapid' varies depending on which first aid guidelines you're following) then call the emergency services (possibly after putting them in the recovery position, again varying on which guidelines you're looking at and whether or not a spinal injury may be suspected).\n\nThat's not the same thing as immediately deciding it's a severe head injury, panicking and demanding a helicopter though.

They're matter. All matter is a chemical of some kind.  You can't ever be a decent cook without at least a basic knowledge of chemistry, which you seem to lack if you're going to say things like that.\n\nAlso, canned goods are *not* good indefinitely. The biggest risk is botulism. While most spoilage in canned goods will be fairly obvious from changes in color/texture/smell botulism may be able to grow without affecting any of that. While your tomatoes and pickled goods are unlikely to be contaminated with botulism, anything low acid that has been improperly canned could potentially carry it. Heat will kill any initial spores that may grow, keeping it from becoming a problem, however you'll never cook it out once it's grown. It creates a potent neurotoxin. The live spores aren't necessarially harmful in themselves, just the byproduct they leave behind.", "id": "d9ocvqe"}]]], "3wont9": ["I bet he can't stick his tongue out!

What you should be worried about, though, is bacteria. \n\n>A recent study by the Robert Koch Institute published in the Epidemiological Bulletin has shown that raw minced pork is the most important risk factor for contracting yersiniosis. Yesiniosis is a gastro-intestinal disease which is notably caused by the bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica. Yersinia are predominantly spread through food, especially raw pork. Pork, for example minced pork and seasoned minced meat, is often eaten raw in Germany. One of the surprising findings of the published study was the high number of children who had eaten raw minced pork. Even of children who were one year old or younger it was reported that almost 30% of those who had fallen ill (and 4 % of the control persons) had eaten raw minced pork.\n\n>In Germany and other European countries, Campylobacter is now the most prevalent bacterial pathogen for enteric infections in humans. In the year 2011, more than 70,000 human campylobacteriosis cases were reported. Campylobacter bacteria are notably found in raw or insufficiently heated poultry meat, but also in raw meat of other animals as well as raw milk and hen\u2019s eggs.\n\n>As part of zoonosis monitoring, salmonella, most frequently Salmonella Typhimurium, were detected in 5 % of minced meat samples in 2009. This finding confirms that raw minced meat can be a source of infection for humans.\n\n>To protect themselves against often severe cases of food-borne infections, especially vulnerable sections of the population such as children under five, pregnant women, elderly and persons with a weakened immune system should as a matter of principle refrain from eating raw foods. They should therefore avoid consuming raw mince or seasoned minced meat, raw sausage, raw milk and raw-milk cheese, raw fish (e.g. sushi) and certain fishery products (e.g. smoked and gravad salmon) as well as raw seafood (e.g. raw oysters).\n\n>Ground meat such as mince in particular offers, on account of its large surface, ideal breeding conditions for microorganisms. To avoid that such meat goes off and that pathogens can grow, especially strict requirements apply to the production and storage of raw mince. This means that minced meat bought over the counter should, even in private households, only be stored in the fridge and used up on the day it is bought. Pre-packed fresh mince must come with a use-by date (\u201cuse by...\u201d) and a description of the storage temperature to be observed. If the storage temperature stated on the packaging cannot be adhered to in the private household, the mince should be used on the day it is bought and thoroughly fried. After expiry of the use-by date, raw minced meat should not be eaten.\n\n[And that's coming from a German source](http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/press_information/2012/11/seasoned_minced_meat_and_raw_minced_pork_are_not_for_little_children_-129197.html) ;) "], [17, "So, you guys dont like sushi too or what?"], [10, "Also called \"Fleischmarmelade\"."], [10, "Lecker!"], [13, "It's called \"Mett\" and one usually eats it with some onions, salt & pepper.

Yesiniosis is a gastro-intestinal disease which is notably caused by the bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica. Yersinia are predominantly spread through food, especially raw pork. Pork, for example minced pork and seasoned minced meat, is often eaten raw in Germany. One of the surprising findings of the published study was the high number of children who had eaten raw minced pork. Even of children who were one year old or younger it was reported that almost 30% of those who had fallen ill (and 4 % of the control persons) had eaten raw minced pork.\n\n>In Germany and other European countries, Campylobacter is now the most prevalent bacterial pathogen for enteric infections in humans. In the year 2011, more than 70,000 human campylobacteriosis cases were reported. Campylobacter bacteria are notably found in raw or insufficiently heated poultry meat, but also in raw meat of other animals as well as raw milk and hen\u2019s eggs.\n\n>As part of zoonosis monitoring, salmonella, most frequently Salmonella Typhimurium, were detected in 5 % of minced meat samples in 2009. This finding confirms that raw minced meat can be a source of infection for humans.\n\n>To protect themselves against often severe cases of food-borne infections, especially vulnerable sections of the population such as children under five, pregnant women, elderly and persons with a weakened immune system should as a matter of principle refrain from eating raw foods. They should therefore avoid consuming raw mince or seasoned minced meat, raw sausage, raw milk and raw-milk cheese, raw fish (e.g. sushi) and certain fishery products (e.g. smoked and gravad salmon) as well as raw seafood (e.g. raw oysters).\n\n>Ground meat such as mince in particular offers, on account of its large surface, ideal breeding conditions for microorganisms. To avoid that such meat goes off and that pathogens can grow, especially strict requirements apply to the production and storage of raw mince. This means that minced meat bought over the counter should, even in private households, only be stored in the fridge and used up on the day it is bought. Pre-packed fresh mince must come with a use-by date (\u201cuse by...\u201d) and a description of the storage temperature to be observed. If the storage temperature stated on the packaging cannot be adhered to in the private household, the mince should be used on the day it is bought and thoroughly fried. After expiry of the use-by date, raw minced meat should not be eaten.\n\n[And that's coming from a German source](http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/press_information/2012/11/seasoned_minced_meat_and_raw_minced_pork_are_not_for_little_children_-129197.html) ;) ", "id": "czf8au2"}, {"comment": "That's why you make/eat it the day you buy it from your local butcher and  you don't use days old prepacked ground meat from the supermarket.", "id": "czfb14z"}, {"comment": ">Even of children who were one year old or younger \n\nWho the fuck gives their one-year old raw meat to eat?
