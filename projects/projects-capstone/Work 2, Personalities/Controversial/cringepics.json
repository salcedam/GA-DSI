I over reacted a little to being called a slave for not being available one night.  It went downhill from there.  We both said some things we shouldn't have.

It has since been bought by Polycom. That happened in 1999 I think.\n\nEdit: I like how people who don't understand how far video conferencing has come in 20 years are downvoting this. Were you alive in 1997? If you even had Internet it was most likely 56k dial up AOL. Fucking AIM wasn't even created yet (released may of that year), let alone online video conferencing services for the general public.\n\nEdit: typos, grammar.\n\nEdit: [Picturetel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PictureTel_Corp.)\n\nEdit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoconferencing\n\n>Videoconferencing systems throughout the 1990s rapidly evolved from very expensive proprietary equipment, software and network requirements to a standards-based technology readily available to the general public at a reasonable cost.\n\n>Finally, in the 1990s, Internet Protocol-based videoconferencing became possible, and more efficient video compression technologies were developed, permitting desktop, or personal computer (PC)-based videoconferencing. In 1992 CU-SeeMe was developed at Cornell by Tim Dorcey et al. **In 1995 the first public videoconference between North America and Africa took place, linking a technofair in San Francisco with a techno-rave and cyberdeli in Cape Town. At the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Nagano, Japan, Seiji Ozawa conducted the Ode to Joy from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony simultaneously across five continents in near-real time.**\n\n>**While videoconferencing technology was initially used primarily within internal corporate communication networks, one of the first community service usages of the technology started in 1992 through a unique partnership with PictureTel and IBM Corporations which at the time were promoting a jointly developed desktop based videoconferencing product known as the PCS/1. Over the next 15 years, Project DIANE (Diversified Information and Assistance Network) grew to utilize a variety of videoconferencing platforms to create a multi-state cooperative public service and distance education network consisting of several hundred schools, neighborhood centers, libraries, science museums, zoos and parks, public assistance centers, and other community oriented organizations.**\n\n>**In the 2000s, videotelephony was popularized via free Internet services such as Skype and iChat, web plugins and on-line telecommunication programs that promoted low cost, albeit lower-quality, videoconferencing to virtually every location with an Internet connection.**\n\n\n>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev attending the Singapore APEC summit, holding a videoconference with Rashid Nurgaliyev via a Tactical MXP, after an arms depot explosion in Russia (2009).\nIn May 2005, the first high definition video conferencing systems, produced by LifeSize Communications, were displayed at the Interop trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, able to provide video at 30 frames per second with a 1280 by 720 display resolution.[8][9] Polycom introduced its first high definition video conferencing system to the market in 2006. As of the 2010s, high definition resolution for videoconferencing became a popular feature, with most major suppliers in the videoconferencing market offering it.\n\n>**Technological developments by videoconferencing developers in the 2010s have extended the capabilities of video conferencing systems beyond the boardroom for use with hand-held mobile devices that combine the use of video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities broadcasting in real-time over secure networks, independent of location. Mobile collaboration systems now allow multiple people in previously unreachable locations, such as workers on an off-shore oil rig, the ability to view and discuss issues with colleagues thousands of miles away. Traditional videoconferencing system manufacturers have begun providing mobile applications as well, such as those that allow for live and still image streaming.**[10]", "id": "cy4iu6l"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cy4hn9s"}, {"comment": "> Who the fuck had a webcam on MSN 18 years ago?\n\nNo one, MSN Messenger (1999\u20132005) [added the video chat button in version 7.5, released August 23, 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger).\n\nMSN Messenger itself was only released on July 22, 1999.\n\n18 years ago is 1997...", "id": "cy4idc9"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cy4igqv"}, {"comment": "Or maybe he just forgot how long ago it was, who knows ", "id": "cy4ijhr"}, {"comment": "Commenter was right it turns out it was yahoo.

In either case, the tenant may recover actual damages not less than an amount equal to one month's rent. \n\n------------\n\nThat means your friend can potentially hold the landlord liable for a fine of one months rent.\n\nHe also cannot retaliate, read page 28:\n\n-------------\n\n33-1381.

If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but which have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct or terminate the rental agreement. In either case, the tenant may recover actual damages not less than an amount equal to one month's rent. \n\n------------\n\nThat means your friend can potentially hold the landlord liable for a fine of one months rent.\n\nHe also cannot retaliate, read page 28:\n\n-------------\n\n33-1381.

Definition of forcible entry\n\nA \"forcible entry,\" or an entry where entry is not given by law within the meaning of this article, is:\n\n1. An entry without the consent of the person having the actual possession.\n\n2. As to a landlord, an entry upon the possession of his tenant at will or by sufferance, whether with or without the tenant's consent. \n\n-------------\n\nIf you want the landlord to leave you alone, send him a letter via USPS certified mail, return receipt, telling him BRIEFLY and POLITELY that his behavior is unprofessional and bordering on harassment, and all further contact should be made in writing, via USPS, or you may seek further legal remedies.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nEDIT: In the other thread said you live in AZ, so I updated my info.", "id": "cyu6552"}, {"comment": "Unless, like vampires, they're invited.

First, it's strongly indicated that these two have had sex. Otherwise, there'd be no reason for her to say it's not him. She also said she was going to give him a surprise visit. Odds are, this girl cheats on her boyfriend fairly regularly. And even if the girl and the guy here haven't had sex, they clearly know each other, so he might be aware of her general habits which led him to question who she slept with. In other words, \"By who,\" was a perfectly reasonable question.\n\nAlso, if her boyfriend was the one who knocked her up, don't you think it'd be more reasonable for her to go to him? Or even to a girlfriend, as opposed to a guy she's been involved with that (apparently) doesn't even live near her? It positively *screams* of attention-whoring.

This is the reality of being in a relationship with someone who has BPD, though obviously, with treatment, a lot of that can be managed on her end without controlling him.\n\nPersonality disorders are called disorders for a reason. Because they lead to disordered behaviour and conflict-ridden relationships. That sometimes leads to abuse, as is also the case for other personality disorders, like Narcissism. If this was not the case, it would not be a disorder and would not require professional intervention in order to manage. \n\n", "id": "d48ywtt"}, {"comment": "Are you a doctor?

It doesn't mean all white people are racists out to hold minorities down. It just means being part of the majority group is usually more beneficial than being a minority in most countries. The white privilege people refer to is based on strictly American population and race demographics. There are always exceptions. I probably had more privilege than some whites since my black parents were/are upper middle class architects. There are poor and disadvantaged white people but it doesn't negate an over all trend of white privilege.\n\nAlso overt personal racism is different than institutionalized racism which is on a macro systematic schale. Any race is capable of racism. I have seen the white and asians bullied when I went to a majority black school. A group needs to dominate an area or be part of the majority to be part of large scale systematic institutionalized racism. This doesn't mean there is group of white men maliciously trying to bar minorities from jobs. Are there white people like that? Yes but they are probably much smaller than the ones who do it unconsciously. The concept of homogeneity dictates that we are more likely to mate with, be friends with, date and give unconscious favoritism to those similar to us. This could be in race, socioeconomic status or hobby. It's a big part of the reason white people usually date other white people. It's not because whites are racist or hate the look of other races. This phenomenon carries over to the job market. Remember whites are 63%(72 if you count white hispanics like those from spain).

By not allowing them to vent you don't allow for negative emotions to pass.

At that point you are just going to argue who wants it more, that's not going to go anywhere. \n\nYou do seem to get angry quite a lot in these conversations though.

I know a lot of people here support you, and that is fine. But you shouldn't downplay your own influences on both conversations you had.\n\nI agree with this guy on one point, I'll put it in my own words though:\nWhen your goal is to be friends, whatever happened, if somebody is upset, it is in the friendship's best benefit to resolve it.\n\nIn other words, if you want to be friends with somebody, if they are upset then you should probably allow them to vent their frustration. By not allowing them to vent you don't allow for negative emotions to pass. Even if this would conflict with your own desire to not talk about it, it would be for the greater benefit of the friendship to do so.\n\nIn no way are you obligated to do so, but it would probably be best to do it.  \n\n**However**, this guy probably shouldn't have gotten this upset in the first place.  At least I think it was pretty harmless.  \nFrom my perspective this guy was also annoying, since he didn't listen to you, but always responded with something that disagreed with you.  \nIf you ask somebody why they don't play chess, then just listen to their answer. Don't start disagreeing with their answer. It's *their* answer.\n\nThis whole discussion could probably have been prevented from both sides. So I'm not going to blame somebody.   \nBut since 80% of the conversation seems to have been discussing whether or not it to drop it, those are my thoughts. \n\nAt the end you also say you wanted to drop it way more than he wanted to continue. At that point you are just going to argue who wants it more, that's not going to go anywhere. \n\nYou do seem to get angry quite a lot in these conversations though.

But by reading back on  things like this you can actually see what's happening, and how responses and sometimes even just choice of words can influence the conversation.   \n\nI can see his intentions in the original chess hobby talk, he was just trying to make conversation. The things he said were all true, but where he went wrong is that he didn't just listen to you, and while you were just trying to talk about your experiences, he always replied with 'Well no, but..', arguing facts and semantics, instead of just letting you talk. My coaching professor said it this way (in Dutch, so excuse things that are lost in translation): you need to stand besides somebody, not opposing them. You need to be interested in how *they* feel and experience things. Make it your effort to understand how it works for them, how it works for you is not relevant. \n\nI think later during the conversation you were both trying to get your points across, while both not really listening to the other. He was trying to get his rational point across that he wants to discuss it, while you were trying to get your point across that you are upset and don't want to. It takes one person to step out of that and just say fine, I'll listen to you now and will try to understand where you are coming from, and when you're done you will do the same for me. \n\nAlso, like I said in my first post, you need to allow somebody to vent.

Git stores your code in these things called \"branches\", which you can kind of think of as folders in a filesystem. \"master\" is the main branch/folder, and it's common for programmers to work by copying master into a new folder/branch just for themselves, editing the code in their personal WIP branch until they're happy with it, and then copying their changes back over to master once they're done with their work and sure that it's ready to go. The \"master\" branch is where you put all the code that is supposed to be done and confirmed working. \n\nThat process of copying your WIP branch changes back over to the \"master\" folder/branch is what's called \"pushing to master\", and it's a totally routine part of working. Unfortunately though, if you and another programmer have both worked on the same files at the same time in your own different personal branches, git doesn't know who's changes to save when you try to push your branches back in--you both changed the files in different ways at the same time, so it just doesn't know who's changes (or both) should take priority. You have to manually go through all the conflicting files and tell git which lines to keep from whose changes. It's generally a pain in the ass to try and resolve these changes and make sure that the program is still working, since there's potentially a ton of conflicts and you need to understand both your own and your coworker's changes.\n\n\"Force pushing\" is telling git to just completely forget *everything* that \"master\" is right now, delete it, and replace it with your WIP branch instead. It means you don't have to resolve any conflicts, because you're just completely deleting the old \"master\" off the face of the earth, forever and ever amen, and overwriting it with your WIP branch instead. This is tempting to some programmers because fixing merge conflicts is so annoying, but it's a fucking horrible practice for a bunch of reasons:\n\n* any changes any other programmers *finished* after you started your WIP branch are potentially lost forever, since you deleted the version of master that had them. better hope they still have their personal branches saved\n* any changes any other programmers *started* after you started your branch are going to have absolutely horrible merge conflicts that will be impossible to resolve without some crazy git wizardry (\"git am patch\" mostly), they may have to start all over. git won't even recognize that they're from the same codebase, because as far as git's concerned those changes came from a branch/folder that doesn't exist anymore\n* your force push completely dropped a bunch of history off of master, so it is now impossible to go back in time and get those old changes back if you need to for any reason\n\nIt's harsh but it is pretty fair to fire somebody for it IMO, depending on the context around them deciding to do it.

I doubt you had any kind of emotional distress about being straight. \n\nSo when I say \"that's so straight\" you think \"lol yeah it is\"\n\nWhen you say \"that's so gay\" I immediately am reminded that all the stuff I've been through to be the person I am today, a gay person, is still being used in a negative context .

Why choose a word that people use to identify a huge part of who they are?

A time that is still on the fringe between acceptance and not in this country (US). It's offensive.

Over time you learn just to save the last slice for them, to take turns using the shit controller, and develop mature ways of handling sharing limited resources (whether it's actually mature or wrestling into submission). You also learn by example from them - like how it's disgusting if he leaves his jerking sock in plain view, so that you never do that yourself. Sharing space with someone means you have not only ideas of \"territory\" - your zone, my zone, the DMZ between - but also how to maintain them so that Mom doesn't kill you both.

It's not like Brazilians don't laugh the same way as everyone else in real life, but our writing system doesn't allow for a good representation of \"hahaha\".

So \"Rararara\" sounds something like \"Hattattattatta\" which is a horrible way to laugh. The way to circumvent this would be to use double Rs, which always sound like H, but \"Rarrarrarra\" is also a horrible way to laugh. \n\nWhat happens then is that everyone comes up with their own way to type laughter. \"kkkkkk\" was the first one. You can extend the amount of ks within reason. \"huehuehue\" was the precursor of \"ehauheau\" and \"shuahsuahs\" expands on this line, although modifying some key elements by adding another consonant. Some people decide to drop the H entirely, and add other consonants to their liking. The most common type of laugh in this category is \"kpaskaposka\". Some people don't like any consonants in their laugh, so they laugh \"eoaieoaieo\", usually in caps lock. \"Hahaha\" is starting to appear, now that more people are able to learn English, and there are also those who feel like all these kinds of laughs are stupid and simply say \"rs\", short for \"risos\", \"laughter\" in Portuguese. These are usually older people, and so the younger generations sometimes make fun of them by laughing \"r\u00e7\", corrupting the original \"rs\". Most young people who use \"rs\" are being ironic.

COMPUTER OPEN *indicate window opening and then finger spelling the word...* R-E-D-D-I-T *signing signs for...* TYPING EXPRESSION DISCUSSION\n\nThat's a really rough explanation of signing, there is a way to \"gloss\" the language into written but it would *not* have the *italicized explanations* I gave above.\n\nEnglish is subject verb object (SVO) while ASL is object subject verb (OSV) and so this can get extremely messy when trying to write ASL into English because ASL has no written equivalent.\n\nLow functioning, linguistic minority/ASL, digital fast paced hearing centered world - those all add up to limited typed expression.\n\nHow was that?\n\nedit - few typos", "id": "d6mi5ss"}, {"comment": "That makes sense. I was never fluent in ASL - I could only ever sign enough to be vaguely understood. I get now why my \"broken English\" style of signing wasn't regarded too badly.\n\nBut what of the overly expressive emotions?

As a young Asian Brit, this was so uncomfortable for me.", "id": "d6misy1"}, {"comment": "I've found this to be true also.\n\nOverly expressed emotions...\n\nWell, let's consider that our emotional expression presents, in humans, more as nonverbal communication/body language than in speech overall. \n\nIf your source language is a signed, physical, full body language with facial expressions and even shoulder positioning as grammar then your emotional expression is going to be as a matter of just conditioning more intense than your hearing counterparts.\n\nSome facial grammar also, for lack of better word, *rhymes* with emotional expression in the human face.\n\nE.g. a rhetorical who? What? Where? When? Why? question has the eyebrows and brow of anger as their grammar while in yes or no question the upper face will rhyme slightly with surprise.\n\nThe intense emotional expression we experience from a deaf person may just be them being grammatically accurate to their first language.\n\nThe signing off, \"I love you!\" may also just mean \"see you later!\" as it is a common handshape goodbye in the culture.\n\nSome words and signs can be *severely* mistranslated in text... \n\nBack in college one deafie of mine texted me on a Friday night and asked if I wanted to \"go to parties to rape girls in city tonight?\" \n\nHe was asking me to go to a party to pick up chicks downtown.\n\nI Facetimed him to get a better picture of what he was saying and when I explained his sign would be better translated to the English words \"pick up chicks\" instead of \"rape\" and explained what the word rape meant... He shrieked. \n\nMaybe the wrong anecdote for this response but it's a good example to show - if a person is a linguistic minority and our communication is *allways* both verbal and nonverbal *and* they are trying to communicate with someone in another language... \n\nHow was that?", "id": "d6mjgdz"}, {"comment": "Thanks for writing all that out...

There's an in-app chat that's meant to be used until you're more comfortable moving to a different medium. Not everyone has Skype or Snapchat (I don't). Texting is way harder to block than most in-app communication. I'm not even actually sure how to do it and would have to look it up; yet every app like this that I've used has a very obvious way to block people.\n\nWhy move to text? There's nothing wrong with the in-app communication approach. You won't have to deal with the extra work of exchanging numbers and adding contacts, there's no keeping track of who someone is (usually the in-app messaging would let you view a profile or something for that user), and if they turn out to be an ass, you can block them easier.\n\nInsisting on moving to a different medium so early is just odd to me. That's something you do after you get to know each other a bit. Also, the jaded person in me thinks that anyone who wants to move to Skype or Snapchat so early is probably fishing for nudes.

Every college has one or two. We had them all. Those things are totally great, but those groups on our campus had way more attendees than you would think. Greek life was pretty much the only thing to do.\n\nIt is an academic standout school, but I got accepted. I was not really intelligent, but I am Caucasian which was a fairly small minority. Obviously things like that are speculation and probably incorrect, but I still found it odd that I got rejection letters from less academically regarded schools, but an offer of scholarship to UTD.\n\nHonestly, it was a great school. The professors were mostly great and the school vibe was generally good. There just wasn't a whole lot for someone like me who wasn't in to Greek life and wasn't that smart.
