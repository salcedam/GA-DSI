There are a few good reasons that he doesn't have pics of you in his porn stash (for the purposes of this discussion, I'm assuming that we're talking about sexy pics that you sent him). \n\n1. Sometimes reality and fantasy don't mesh very well. Personally, I've never masturbated to sexy pics or mental images of my wife. Not because I don't find her sexy, but because she and that sexual relationship are *real* and I can't reconcile that with my masturbation fantasies. I like fruit loops and I like orange juice, but I don't mix them.\n\n2. He may not want to objectify you in that way. I'd say most guys masturbate to random people because they require a level of emotional detachment from someone that they're objectifying. You are special to him...so much more than a tool to help him get off. \n\n3. He may fap to something different than you. If you're petite, maybe he faps to curvy girls or vice versa, for example. Or if you're white, maybe he looks at women of color. Or maybe he's aroused by gay or transgender porn. This doesn't mean that he likes these things better or ever wants to experience them, but, again, masturbation is fantasy. It's like a way to experience some sexual diversity or explore some kinks while in a monogamous relationship. This is really common and totally harmless.\n\nOf course, YMMV with these things...everyone is different. Assuming he's being faithful to you and your relationship is strong, these are some totally reasonable explanations."], [14, ">  Then my replacement phone got broken from a petty fight with him.\n\nWas this altercation as violent as it sounds?

In what world is this even remotely acceptable or okay?\n\nThat aside, just ask him or talk to him?

It leaves that neutral territory when its \"real\" people though, especially a folder full of pics of his ex, etc. A few sporadic pics is an \"oops I didn't delete it,\" a folder is a stash. Maybe he forgot they are there though. Who knows. Just talk to him. I wouldn't be mad or upset about anything until then (or even after since its his spank bank).\n\nAlso, the pics of you may be elsewhere? He may not want them left somewhere where they aren't super private so no one accidentally sees them. I don't keep pics of my partner with my porn.

If I want to be sexual, we use sexual messages, photos, cam calls, etc. I don't need porn of the woman I love, so I don't keep it in my porn folders.

But if it is a risqu\u00e9 pic of my wife, then whomever is seeing it probably knows my wife.

But i know if i was actively thinking of an ex or friend like that it would feel wrong and i suppose while you never know whats going on in someone elses head, seeing a picture of that fantasy probably makes it more real.

But I totally understand why this would make you feel somewhat insecure. There are a few good reasons that he doesn't have pics of you in his porn stash (for the purposes of this discussion, I'm assuming that we're talking about sexy pics that you sent him). \n\n1. Sometimes reality and fantasy don't mesh very well. Personally, I've never masturbated to sexy pics or mental images of my wife. Not because I don't find her sexy, but because she and that sexual relationship are *real* and I can't reconcile that with my masturbation fantasies. I like fruit loops and I like orange juice, but I don't mix them.\n\n2. He may not want to objectify you in that way. I'd say most guys masturbate to random people because they require a level of emotional detachment from someone that they're objectifying. You are special to him...so much more than a tool to help him get off. \n\n3. He may fap to something different than you. If you're petite, maybe he faps to curvy girls or vice versa, for example. Or if you're white, maybe he looks at women of color. Or maybe he's aroused by gay or transgender porn. This doesn't mean that he likes these things better or ever wants to experience them, but, again, masturbation is fantasy. It's like a way to experience some sexual diversity or explore some kinks while in a monogamous relationship. This is really common and totally harmless.\n\nOf course, YMMV with these things...everyone is different.

I know they're actors getting paid to generally look like they are enjoying what is happening to them - no matter how degrading the content, and I can't get that out of my mind to enjoy it.\nFor example: I find it silly how often foreplay will skip the woman and go straight to the man (when in reality- foreplay is what will get the woman wet & is therefore pretty functional to sex being any good for a woman). We literally don't need to see a guy receiving a blowjob but a girl receiving a little oral beforehand would genuinely make the actual sex act itself 4x better for her- yet how many pornos could care less about showing real functional foreplay of the women? Not many proportion wise..\n\nPlus- the way most of the girls touch themselves is also pretty unfunctional to an orgasm - if they kept at that same form for 30 more minutes they still wouldn't orgasm. I think this is because showing the girls clit being consistently touched obstructs the view and so they don't show it much. Am I the only one who notices how fake the form for female masturbation is in a majority of pornos? Cause sometimes it feels like it- considering so many people watch it.\n\nI just can't get into it- it's like if you saw an attractive actor having a terrible script - it shouldn't make it a good movie just because they're a 'good actor'.\n\n4/5 women need clitoral stimulation to orgasm yet how rare is it to see consistent clitoral stimulation in pornos! It wouldn't take much- yet it would actually make the scene a lot more tolerable and enjoyable for the women than just having this large thing thrusting at them repetitively (& that's the 'softcore' stuff).\n\nI have also experienced porn addicted partners and seen the actual effects of things like addict related desensitisation and P.I.E.D. (Porn induced erectile dysfunction). If you google 'affects of porn' (not even negative affects just affects) you'll see a bunch of negative things that can happen to people that look at it too often & see gross stats about the numbers of divorces it can inspire by addicts choosing to prefer releasing by themselves than with their partner. But the porn industry could care less about this- they're a multibillion dollar industry they don't care about the affects their industry has - or how much it chews in young women and spits them out- they figure getting people addicted to free porn to get them hopefully eventually paying them means they are making consumers/customers for life. If you look at the stats on how much rented porn contains violence against women it's literally chilling.\n\nBut still a lot of people would label me as a prude for this. Or just say I haven't found the right genre- a porn actress may like a particular style of porn-scene but chances are she has to enact a lot more genres out there that she's less comfortable with- so I find the whole thing off-putting. I have a strange respect for the sh*t some of those women would have to put up with in their job- a respect and a sadness.  So many of them won't even last 6 months in the industry or have much money by the end of it- yet those videos could follow them for life and the fact that they had to compromise morals to stay in such a competitive industry will follow them too.

I know they're actors getting paid to generally look like they are enjoying what is happening to them - no matter how degrading the content, and I can't get that out of my mind to enjoy it.\nFor example: I find it silly how often foreplay will skip the woman and go straight to the man (when in reality- foreplay is what will get the woman wet & is therefore pretty functional to sex being any good for a woman). We literally don't need to see a guy receiving a blowjob but a girl receiving a little oral beforehand would genuinely make the actual sex act itself 4x better for her- yet how many pornos could care less about showing real functional foreplay of the women? Not many proportion wise..\n\nPlus- the way most of the girls touch themselves is also pretty unfunctional to an orgasm - if they kept at that same form for 30 more minutes they still wouldn't orgasm. I think this is because showing the girls clit being consistently touched obstructs the view and so they don't show it much. Am I the only one who notices how fake the form for female masturbation is in a majority of pornos? Cause sometimes it feels like it- considering so many people watch it.\n\nI just can't get into it- it's like if you saw an attractive actor having a terrible script - it shouldn't make it a good movie just because they're a 'good actor'.\n\n4/5 women need clitoral stimulation to orgasm yet how rare is it to see consistent clitoral stimulation in pornos! It wouldn't take much- yet it would actually make the scene a lot more tolerable and enjoyable for the women than just having this large thing thrusting at them repetitively (& that's the 'softcore' stuff).\n\nI have also experienced porn addicted partners and seen the actual effects of things like addict related desensitisation and P.I.E.D. (Porn induced erectile dysfunction). If you google 'affects of porn' (not even negative affects just affects) you'll see a bunch of negative things that can happen to people that look at it too often & see gross stats about the numbers of divorces it can inspire by addicts choosing to prefer releasing by themselves than with their partner. But the porn industry could care less about this- they're a multibillion dollar industry they don't care about the affects their industry has - or how much it chews in young women and spits them out- they figure getting people addicted to free porn to get them hopefully eventually paying them means they are making consumers/customers for life. If you look at the stats on how much rented porn contains violence against women it's literally chilling.\n\nBut still a lot of people would label me as a prude for this. Or just say I haven't found the right genre- a porn actress may like a particular style of porn-scene but chances are she has to enact a lot more genres out there that she's less comfortable with- so I find the whole thing off-putting. I have a strange respect for the sh*t some of those women would have to put up with in their job- a respect and a sadness.  So many of them won't even last 6 months in the industry or have much money by the end of it- yet those videos could follow them for life and the fact that they had to compromise morals to stay in such a competitive industry will follow them too.

Way more attractive than I am. Easily 9/10, guys were constantly staring at her. She never flirted with anyone else in front of me. \n\n2. Her parents absolutely hated me, basically called me a rapist to my face the first time I met them. Hardcore Catholic types, hated that I was Jewish, got her younger brother to hack into my Facebook and find a status where I talked about my depression and said that it was Satan cursing me for my religion. They were even nuttier than the daughter ever was. They got on my case so often that the nickname for the mother among my social group became \"Whorecuntbitch\" (classy, I know). \n\n3. She would constantly complain about her \"ex-boyfriend,\" who had tried to kiss her and she had gotten so scared of the idea of being physical with a man that she'd literally ran out of his place and back to hers. \n\n4. She would also constantly talk about this Italian guy she had met on a trip to Italy (her family was loaded), and how gorgeous and sexy he was. I would jokingly complain about this and she'd make some reference about how he couldn't do to her what I could (her exact words for our activities was literally \"dark magic\").\n\n5. She immediately got off on the wrong foot when I introduced her to my friends by panicking upon discovering that one of them was a Muslim. Said friend was not happy about this. \n\n6. She would drink a *lot* of coffee so she wouldn't get much sleep. Somehow she looked absolutely fantastic despite how little she slept and how badly she ate (and I know what a girl without makeup looks like, so trust me on that one). The flipside is that she'd get mad whenever I'd get too sleepy to continue talking to her. Which was every time. \n\n7. Over the entire four months that we dated, we didn't have a single full conversation. I didn't realize that until after the breakup. We spent more time fucking than speaking to each other.\n\n8. She didn't have a job and relied on her parents to pay for literally everything. Every time we went out for a meal, I had to pay for everything. She complained on Valentine's Day when all I got her was a yellow tulip (I thought it was cute, sue me). She also got genuinely confused when I would awkwardly explain that I couldn't go out to eat every time I saw her since it was too expensive to continually do that. One more interesting fact: in the four months I dated her, she didn't eat a single meal at home and went out to eat for all meals. I know this because every time she ate anything, she'd excitedly tell me about it. She especially loved Chipotle. \n\n9. She had probably the worst case of ADHD and ADD I've ever seen in another human being. This was cute at first but when someone literally forgets that you've basically got your entire fist up her snatch because you remember a Vine you watched several hours earlier and start giggling and imitating the Vine at the same time, it gets kinda weird. Genuine Manic Pixie Dream Girls are no bueno, folks. \n\n10. The most infamous incident around my friends is when without warning, she tackled me to the ground in front of everyone, began furiously trying to make out with me, and tried to give me a handjob in front of *all of them*. I'm not an exhibitionist, and I had to physically restrain her with my arms in order to get her to stop. This is when she said out loud, in a whine, that \"it wasn't fair that I can't play with Favorite Toy.\" The looks on everyone's faces was acutely struggling to resist laughing despite how funny it must have been to them. I still get shit about that. \n\n11. The last time she hung out with me and my friends, we were playing a party game on the Xbox. One of them gives a nasty look at her, turns to the screen, and names his character \"God Isn't Real.\" Everyone else bursts into hysterical laughter looking at her, and she literally goes white. She spent the car ride home muttering \"heathens\" underneath her breath. \n\n12. I found out later that her parents had no idea half the time that she was seeing me, and had no idea that we were sleeping together. She would pretend to have a sleepover at a friend's place and then spend the night over at mine. They clearly never found out because the father's shotgun shells are not in my chest at the moment. \n\n13. She constantly complained about me using a condom, but since she adamantly refused to use birth control herself (I'm stupid, I know, but I did wrap up Ol' Sparky every time), considering it a \"tool of Big Pharma to repress a woman's natural state\", and because I was a stupid horny shit, I used condoms and she didn't take any pills. \n\n14. This of course resulted in her mistakenly believing a condom had broke and me spending several hours believing I'd impregnated her. We had an argument at a diner about her refusing to take Plan B, even after I offered to buy it for her. Hours later, I rummaged through the garbage, found the condom, and discovered it was unbroken. Thank fucking Christ. She got her period exactly on schedule the next month.\n\n15. She would attempt to play hide-and-go-seek on a whim on some occasions, which was cute the first time but thirty times in, hearing her giggling behind the couch, I really had to wonder if this girl was trolling me or just genuinely stupid. She claimed later that it was her way of seducing me because me finding her usually led to fucking, but she genuinely seemed to enjoy it. \n\n16. Choice quote from the friend who named their character \"God Isn't Real\": \"You might have landed a good-looking girl, but she's dumber than a sack of bricks.\"\n\n17. Here's the doozy: I was bullied a *lot* as a kid, physically, emotionally, every way you can think. This resulted in me being very particular about how I'm touched, and a fear of physical intimacy. We'd be cuddling and suddenly I'd begin to panic, I'd feel like I was being choked out. I would push her away and sit by myself for a bit, having a panic attack, not used to holding someone and being held in return. She'd always get really pissed off when I did this, she'd glare at me and occasionally spit out \"Are you happy yet?\" Which didn't help. She didn't think depression and suicidal ideation were real, basically. \n\n18. She got really upset upon learning I had kissed a girl before I had even met her. Which is again weird because I'd lied about sexual experiences I didn't actually have and she was fine with all those imagined trysts. But I was kissed by a random girl at a party and nothing else, before I met her, and once she heard about it she lost her goddamn mind. \n\n19. She would get genuinely confused as to why I couldn't spend more time with her, because I had two jobs at the time and had long hours in both. This would lead to her saying things like \"well why don't you leave?\" To which I'd say \"well how am I supposed to make money?\" To which she'd say \"Well have your parents buy everything for you.\" This went on in circles. \n\n20. Funniest was on our second date, when a random dude walked out a store we were passing by, eyes went completely wide, and walked off as fast as he could. She began giggling at this, I asked her why, and she said it was her ex. Poor bastard.

We are a social animal by all means? Thats how our species survived. I would not call it a skill. Its there even though we can refine it.\n\nBut this role-reversal with pegging is still a relativly new phenomenon for hetero women. Of course not everyone is into power dynamics and dominance, but it still opens a new door for hetero women to role-reverse which was not really a thing before. How is that linked to women (that are into pegging) being so horny when thinking about pegging. That was my question! :)\n\nI agree that i mostly saw it from a hetero-normative lens, because i wanted to explore my theories (which adressed the hetero-norm) with the community.

But as i said earlier there is also common processes to find with everything in life and these can be examined!\n\nWhen talking about romantic novels i was not referring to it as a generational experience. I was disussing it in regard to a certain type of psyche that exists independently of which period it is. How it speaks to certain categories in the brain which it appeals to.

I wrote that i get immense satisfaction from pleasing my partner. But rather the idea that women get so wet from just thinking about pegging and couldnt wait until there husband comes home to fuck them. This is just my experience from reading from reddit and other forums out there. 80% of the women were more or less saying this and i thought it was a really interesting pattern.

(It's not their fault cause I lied that I was older so they didn't know I was a minor) \n\nMy cousin used to physically, verbally, and emotionally abuse me growing up.  She would curse me and yell at me and punch me.  (She never apologized.  But I have recently forgiven her for my own sake and peace of mind) From our home videos, I could see how I was the happy child but for some reason, all I remember is how she would attack me and torture me.\n\nWith bdsm, I was in control. I called the shots on who had the permission to inflict pain on me. I found it empowering and I guess I wish my baby form could have experienced rough bdsm as a baby to someone worthy of her submission. \n\n\nDisclaimer: I do not wish babies would experience kinky stuff as a baby.

I don't know what jurisdiction you're in (and I advise you not to reveal it publicly), but most jurisdictions I'm familiar with have gray areas around nude pics of infants. Often sharing the pics is fine if the depictions aren't sexualized or appealing to prurient interests. But some pretty wholesome depictions \u2014 like bathtime \u2014 can inadvertently cross that line depending on details like camera angles and who else is in the picture.  \n\nI don't know if anyone has advised you about these issues before.

Thank you for bringing that up, it helps me understand my relationship to women better.\n\nIn regards to the subject at hand, unsolicited dick pics, I think that part of it is driven by wanting to be sexualized and recognized as such. There are times I wind up feeling, for lack of a better term, too domesticated and de-sexualized and that has caused tension in relationships during contexts where I *want* to see evidence that I am seen as sexual/sexually-desirable reflected in a woman's interaction with me.  Unsolicited dick pics may be a shotgun approach to that, a feeling of agency to broadcast the root of one's sexual identity to objects of desire *regardless* of their desire to be cast in that role. It's a selfish thing to do, but given how desexualized most male egalitarian behavior is expected to be I can kind of understand why another dude may engage in it.\n\n**Edit:** having given the above some more thought, I realize I left the idea unfinished.

Sexuality and desirability aren't real/virile just because of a woman's attention--it doesn't disappear when a message goes unreturned--but given the \"success\" metrics that modern men use to evaluate themselves, women's attention is absolutely precious (hence why so many men seek to degrade that attention's value when their efforts to get it aren't successful?). Is there some meme or otherwise-propagating idea that can be sent out into the ether encouraging frustrated men to love themselves as they are right here and now?

Shit, even my current boyfriend has some physical traits I find highly undesirable, but we manage somehow ^^\n\n\nAaaaalrighty, I didn't want to get into genetics, but you clearly insist on it.\n\nSkin color is controlled by various factors, interacting with each other to control the production of skin pigments. A reeeeaaaaaallllly simplified model of this is a classic two-gene \"dominant\" type hereditary model, where the dominant allele of either gene adds x amount to the overall melanine production. In reality, it's obviously more complicated than that, but I hope you accept a somewhat simplified model.  \nSo... we have dominant and recessive traits \"interacting\" with each other. If, for some reason, the reproductive capabilities of individuals with the recessive (less melanine) trait is lesser than that of the dominant ones, the recessive allele will be less frequent among the first generation of offsprings than in the parental generation. This is a thing called selection. In African populations, selection worked against the (mutant, by the way) \"white\" allele, while in Europe, the wild \"black\" allele was the weaker/less favorable for some reason. And since the two populations were pretty isolated, they evolved into subspecies (some consider \"race\" as a category even smaller than subspecies, still means major genetic differences between isolated populations) of the human species. The thing is, subspecies can still interbreed and produce fertile offspring, which turn out to have mixed alleles, and therefore are genetically different from both of their parents (one parent being almost 100% black, the other 100% white, while the child is 50-50, which results in brown skin). If all isolation ceased, mostly everything would even out, ranging from skin color and width/length ratio to alcohol tolerance and stuff like that, but currently, there are several levels of medium-heavy isolation that keep races from interbreeding on a global scale. One of them being the Atlantic Ocean, but there are national borders, cultural differences and even a general disinterest in an \"exotic\" mate based on psychological reasons.\n\nAs such, the discussion about race mostly relies on something like accepting the colors of the rainbow as \"red, orange, yellow, etc.\" or referring to them by wavelength or just \"light\". Wavelength of visible light, just like an amount of pigment, is easily quantifiable, and they both have a minimum and a maximum value (~350-750 nm for visible light, and 0 pigment-almost fully literal black, lots of pigment), but values are only marginally different from each other after each \"step\". Hell, race even has more basis than naming colors, as they were actually physically isolated with very little continuous pattern, whereas the possible wavelengths of light follow each other pretty undistinguishably from each other (and while the number of possible skin color codes is technically finite, the number of numbers between 350 and 750 is uncountably infinite, and every one of them is a possible wavelength) So what I'm saying is that I hate the color yellow, and you're saying that purple yellow exists.

The same way that being racist or sexist when choosing an actor for a particular role that requires those criteria is also fine, because the criteria make sense in that context.\n\nDiscrimination is not always bad. It's only bad if the criteria you're using have nothing to do with the choice you're making.

You're perseverating partly out of the belief that you are your thoughts, and the belief that there is some specific reality behind these particular thoughts. Take some time out to just watch your thoughts. You'll see you can separate your awareness and watch them come and go. Sure, you're going through a stormy period, but even in the strongest storms, there are lulls. The same with our streams of conscious thoughts  Eventually, you'll get comfortable with the idea that these particular thoughts are just a pattern of neurons firing, and they will lose their potency. \n\nSource - I've dealt with this even with guys your size, because I'm about the same as your girlfriend's ex and very active sexually. Being the ex or the friend he worries she's tempted by or the casual fling she had or the guy she boned when they broke up a while - being that bigger guy other guys can't forgive their girls for is familiar.

You are allowed preferences too and should never have to deal with feeling settled for.... \n\nIm late 30s now and average low end of girth 6 x 4.6 in my 20s I decided I would not settle for girls who \"settle for me \" and who say they prefer bigger. Its one of the things I do not want when looking for a partner.. And I can honestly say that the women I have met and relationships ive had are much better. I have more confidence in myself because there are standards I hold myself to and the women I date treat me great because of better compatibility.\n\nSo my advice is talk to her.. Communication is key to any successful relationship.By the end of the conversation If it sounds like she likes you but is settling for what you have to offer her.... leave.. Find someone who wants you ALL of you.

They are just thoughts, no particular reason to think she's just trying to protect your feelings, no reason to think she was more sexual with him tha she is with you now. Your girlfriend probably isn't less sexual; I bet she hasn't even reached her prime. Nor is there likely any reason to think you can't stop thinking about it. You do stop thinking about it. \n\nLearn about mindfulness - it's known to work for this kind of body image issue, and penis size insecurity in particular. Jon Kabat-Zinn has good stuff. You're perseverating partly out of the belief that you are your thoughts, and the belief that there is some specific reality behind these particular thoughts. Take some time out to just watch your thoughts. You'll see you can separate your awareness and watch them come and go. Sure, you're going through a stormy period, but even in the strongest storms, there are lulls.

Anyways I have fantasized about bestiality and even sex with fantasy creatures at times, it's a kind of fantasy I go back to from time to time and the fantasies change. Naturally I got curious at some point and went looking for bestiality porn. The most common types of bestiality porn are women with horses or donkeys, and dog on women.\n\nThe thing about women on horse porn is that it's all incredibly fake. A regular size horse could not have sex with a woman without killing her. Horse porn involving penetration is very rare and what does exist tends to be along the lines of a woman masturbating with a flaccid horse penis.

It's a huge turn on for me, especially when the mares are visibly aroused. For some reason I experience very little shame watching that.\n\nDog on women porn is probably the second most common type of bestiality video. The upside is that when a woman presents herself to a dog it's obvious most parties are eagerly consenting by most measures of consent, but for some reason I find this type of porn incredibly disgusting. I think it's the fact that it's the idea of it that turns me on, the dirtiness and taboo, and dogs themselves don't turn me on at all. Dogs and their penises especially are actually a huge turnoff. I experience such a mix of emotions watching dog on women; simultaneously aroused by the taboo, disgusted by the dog and ashamed. I don't watch that type of porn anymore, the fantasy is way better than the reality.\n\nI still experience shame and guilt watching bestiality videos because the stigma is so strong and it does feel... exploitative I guess?

For example, wearing animal ears/tails (like those furry butt plugs) or a collar and leash and one person pretending to be an animal.

The upside is that when a woman presents herself to a dog it's obvious most parties are eagerly consenting by most measures of consent, but for some reason I find this type of porn incredibly disgusting. I think it's the fact that it's the idea of it that turns me on, the dirtiness and taboo, and dogs themselves don't turn me on at all. Dogs and their penises especially are actually a huge turnoff. I experience such a mix of emotions watching dog on women; simultaneously aroused by the taboo, disgusted by the dog and ashamed. I don't watch that type of porn anymore, the fantasy is way better than the reality.\n\nI still experience shame and guilt watching bestiality videos because the stigma is so strong and it does feel... exploitative I guess?

One of the biggest problems I've noticed in the current literature on squirting is that some researchers don't even specify whether they're talking about female ejaculation or squirting, which are two different phenomena; some even use the terms interchangeably.\n\nSo there's no scientific or medical consensus on squirting yet. \n\nI've seen a few biochemical studies that have tested the composition of the liquid expelled from the urethra when a woman squirts, and they're suggested that it is essentially watered down, sterile urine. As a woman who does squirt, that seems plausible. \n\nBut I know that the sensation and mechanics of squirting are very different than peeing. I know that the liquid I expel is not normal urine, as, for me, it is colorless, odorless, mostly tasteless (slightly sweet tinge to it, but it's very faint), and it doesn't leave a stain. My pee is not like that.\n\nFor me, squirting feels good. I get a feeling of sexual relief when it happens. Sometimes it occurs simultaneously with orgasm, and sometimes not.\n\nYou don't have to be turned on by squirting. I don't get turned on when a guy comes on me, as opposed to down the back of my throat or into a condom, because I think that the texture and look of semen is kind of gross. \n\nBut I'm not going to shame a guy for producing semen or tell him not to do it.

One of the biggest problems I've noticed in the current literature on squirting is that some researchers don't even specify whether they're talking about female ejaculation or squirting, which are two different phenomena; some even use the terms interchangeably.\n\nSo there's no scientific or medical consensus on squirting yet. \n\nI've seen a few biochemical studies that have tested the composition of the liquid expelled from the urethra when a woman squirts, and they're suggested that it is essentially watered down, sterile urine. As a woman who does squirt, that seems plausible. \n\nBut I know that the sensation and mechanics of squirting are very different than peeing. I know that the liquid I expel is not normal urine, as, for me, it is colorless, odorless, mostly tasteless (slightly sweet tinge to it, but it's very faint), and it doesn't leave a stain. My pee is not like that.\n\nFor me, squirting feels good. I get a feeling of sexual relief when it happens.

As a person who has been there, this relationship isn't healthy for either of you. You probably kept him around because you feel desired around him and it feels nice to have someone who \"looks up\" to you like that, and he follows you around because he has convinced himself that you are the best thing on two legs and that you two are destined to be together in the long run. Honestly ending this would be the healthiest thing for both of you, however he could react in a way that is unhealthy for him anyway. This guy is going to have problems for a long time anyway unless he pulls his head out of his white horses ass. \n\nThere are ways to have the conversations that you did and still keep things okay, but both parties have to keep it impersonal(which i don't feel either of you did, even though you didn't say it directly) and mature (which i feel like this guy would be incapable of doing). \n\nI bet your husband would be thrilled to have this guy out of your life because this dude is probably just toading around you waiting for a way to steal you away, having said that, a sudden unfriending of this pet you've had for so long is going to incur some degree of suspicion on your husbands side, and this guy is probably going to try to spill the beans in one way or another, so i would be very careful about any information you choose to omit. \n\nOn a scale of infidelity what you did was stupid but it was probably around a 2-3/10. If you lie about it or try to hide it for an extended period of time, or god forbid allow this poor soul to blackmail you into something worse, that number will quickly escalate and its potential damage will go up as well. \n\nI would immediately break contact with this person in a stern and no wishy washy way.

He needs to be seeking other avenues, whether he will admit it or not. \n\nI would prepare what you are going to say to your husband as to why you are breaking contact with him well in advance, probably in writing so you have time to understand what you are saying. I'm not good with phrasing so you are going to have to cross that bridge on your own. You are probably going to want to make sure that your emotional desirablity fantasies are being met, i think that you are going to have a hard time finding a good time to talk about this unless your husband is very understanding and patient. These fantasies need to be talked about though as that is the best way to improve the sex lives between you. Honestly the conversation that you had with this guy is probably the one you should be having with your husband. Maybe ask Hubbie what some of his fantasies are, in a non explicitly sexual setting so that yall can be more relaxed about what you expose. I'm sure that you wont tell all of the deepest fantasies, and neither will he in the first convo, but you need to have the convo several times. Plus look into being the one who fulfills his fantasies, there is literally nothing that will make him desire you more than teasing those fantasies to him. \n\ntl;dr: break communication with this dude; tell husband of situation; have conversation about fantasies and porn preferences either after the smoke clears or before informing the hubbie. \n\nGood luck to you and your husband. be prepped for a day or two in the doghouse but you should be able to work this out.

Sure, but those happen all the time.  People talk about them, apologies are made, and people forgive each other because they love each other.  I have to wonder how much love there really is when there isn't room for forgiveness of something so minor as an inappropriate conversation.

As a person who has been there, this relationship isn't healthy for either of you. You probably kept him around because you feel desired around him and it feels nice to have someone who \"looks up\" to you like that, and he follows you around because he has convinced himself that you are the best thing on two legs and that you two are destined to be together in the long run. Honestly ending this would be the healthiest thing for both of you, however he could react in a way that is unhealthy for him anyway. This guy is going to have problems for a long time anyway unless he pulls his head out of his white horses ass. \n\nThere are ways to have the conversations that you did and still keep things okay, but both parties have to keep it impersonal(which i don't feel either of you did, even though you didn't say it directly) and mature (which i feel like this guy would be incapable of doing). \n\nI bet your husband would be thrilled to have this guy out of your life because this dude is probably just toading around you waiting for a way to steal you away, having said that, a sudden unfriending of this pet you've had for so long is going to incur some degree of suspicion on your husbands side, and this guy is probably going to try to spill the beans in one way or another, so i would be very careful about any information you choose to omit. \n\nOn a scale of infidelity what you did was stupid but it was probably around a 2-3/10. If you lie about it or try to hide it for an extended period of time, or god forbid allow this poor soul to blackmail you into something worse, that number will quickly escalate and its potential damage will go up as well. \n\nI would immediately break contact with this person in a stern and no wishy washy way. No maybes at all. This guy has clinged on to a fantasy version of you for almost a decade, and he will not give that up easily, or quickly, but its better for him to give it up completely than it is for him to waste his life on someone who is not going to fulfill his wishes. He needs to be seeking other avenues, whether he will admit it or not. \n\nI would prepare what you are going to say to your husband as to why you are breaking contact with him well in advance, probably in writing so you have time to understand what you are saying. I'm not good with phrasing so you are going to have to cross that bridge on your own. You are probably going to want to make sure that your emotional desirablity fantasies are being met, i think that you are going to have a hard time finding a good time to talk about this unless your husband is very understanding and patient. These fantasies need to be talked about though as that is the best way to improve the sex lives between you. Honestly the conversation that you had with this guy is probably the one you should be having with your husband. Maybe ask Hubbie what some of his fantasies are, in a non explicitly sexual setting so that yall can be more relaxed about what you expose. I'm sure that you wont tell all of the deepest fantasies, and neither will he in the first convo, but you need to have the convo several times. Plus look into being the one who fulfills his fantasies, there is literally nothing that will make him desire you more than teasing those fantasies to him. \n\ntl;dr: break communication with this dude; tell husband of situation; have conversation about fantasies and porn preferences either after the smoke clears or before informing the hubbie. \n\nGood luck to you and your husband. be prepped for a day or two in the doghouse but you should be able to work this out.

Grab your vibrator or use your fingers to give yourself one or more good orgasms.  Take your time.

There's nothing wrong with being able to make your guy yelp with surprise when you clamp down on him, or being able to \"milk\" him to an orgasm whenever you want - in fact, it's a lot of fun! - but you still need to be able to relax those muscles enough to let him in without causing pain for either of you.\n\nFinally, if two fingers feels very tight even when you don't squeeze, and there's pain or serious resistance when putting three fingers in, you might want to start doing reverse kegels and pelvic floor relaxation exercises to learn how to consciously relax those muscles when you want to.

It could be curiosity about what it'd be like to be with a partner with more common interests/hobbies. It could be that your partner is not the best conversationalist in the world and you wonder what it'd be like to be with a really witty extroverted social butterfly. It could be that your girlfriend doesn't have the most curves and you wonder how much better it'd be with a girl with fuller breasts or a bigger ass. It could be anything.\n\nBut the common denominator is wondering about what else is out there.\n\nThe truth is that everyone you date is going to have some really good aspects and some weaknesses. So if you started dating a different guy his cock size might make PIV somewhat better, but he might be a bit dull outside the bedroom. Or he might have anger issues. Or he might be broke and lack ambition.\n\nThe point is, you have to decide what things are negotiable and what things are non-negotiable.\n\nUnfortunately it's often really hard to make that judgment when you don't have much experience.\n\nMy first LTR was dynamite in bed, I loved her body so much, and she was always in a good mood, fun, and happy but sometimes I felt like we didn't have enough in common intellectually. I ended up breaking up with her to explore, but I never told her 'yeah I just get too bored when we're hanging out alone and I feel like we don't have enough to talk about'.\n\nInstead I gave a generic reason that wouldn't hurt her ego.\n\nShe was my first sex partner and first relationship, looking back she definitely was overall better than most of the people I've been with since then. I've come to realize that some of her positive personality traits that I overlooked are actually really important to me.\n\nBut at the same time I've been with some women who were much more interesting to talk to.\n\nUltimately I'm still at an age where I'm looking for someone who's better than all the rest.\n\nThe point is, there's no real way to win here except to get lucky and find someone who truly is better in every way. But it's usually much healthier to avoid comparing your partner to others and instead focus on their positives. Chances are if you guys break up you'll end up finding someone else to love. Chances are also that if you stay with him you'll have a good relationship.\n\nI really would advise against suggesting a threesome or a cock extender or anything like that. It seems cruel to me to hurt his ego in that way when there's a chance you'll end up dumping him afterwards anyway.\n\nIn my opinion you have to decide for yourself and then if you decide to break up, don't give him the painful truth just give him a little speech about how you still want to find yourself, need to experience more, blah blah and just compliment him the whole time you are breaking up."], [2, "Yes, you are missing out.

My first gf in high school lost her virginity with me. Now I'm fairly average, 5.5\", and I was well aware that there are guys out there with big dicks. Most average guys are very conscious of this and i was no different. I was slightly in secure about it but at the same time, i wasn't disillusioned that so long as I kept her away from those guys she'll never know any better. \n\nSo 5 months into the relationship, she tells me about her curiosity over bigger dicks, not asking permission, just mentioned she wondered what it would feel like. I, an immature 15 year old, blew it out of proportion, and we got into a fight, which lead to other fights and started souring the relationship. But, like a desperate 15 year old, I finally agreed to a three way with a \"stranger\" (known acquaintance, never a friend kind of guy) who was rumored to have a horse cock (he did). lets call him bob\n\nBecause of the bad communication, how immature I was, how the decision was made out of desperation, not out of mutual interest, my first threeway ended my relationship, and she started a short relationship with bob. This  blew my self consciousness into full blown self loathing, and it took a long time and a few really good friends to get me out of it.\n\nHere's the kicker, after said ex broke up with bob, and I could speak to him again (this was like 2 years later), he told me that she actually never really enjoyed it after that first time. She told him that because of the anticipation, how she was so thinking about it for weeks, she was so into the idea that it was explosive for her that first time. But after that, each time they had sex, it didn't measure up, and most times it hurt like a bitch, hence why they broke up.\n\nThe point is this; I think approaching your boyfriend to discover this curiosity s going to be imperative to your relationship, but be careful how to get him to participate. It's perfectly natural and normal to want to experience new partners, and unless you try you will never know if his 4inches is enough for you, but he needs to be a part of it. The only way to get rid of this itch is to scratch it, and I hope you can get him to help you discover more of your sexual preference.\n\nAnd if you find it is for you, don't worry it doesn't mean you're out of options. There are enhancements, and toys that you can bring into your sex life to fulfill this need. A past partner of mine used to get these cravings to be filled up, but was not comfortable with other people, so we bought a penis sleeve for me to better satisfy her when she wanted it. There are many options out there to help.\n\nGood luck"], [1, "One of the many reasons I love older women.

You will get maximum penetration due to your body weight being centered on his cock and may find this position \"fills the void\" both literally and figuratively."], [0, "If you enjoy sex with your boyfriend at the moment then you're missing out on great sex as much as a guy in a relationship with a girl who doesn't have bigger curves. You probably aren't having the best sex of your life, but it's probably good because at this point you most likely love the guy. \n\nWanting to explore other partners and such is something that people seriously breakup over. If the search for better sex consumes you, you might want to make sure it's worth leaving your SO for. Your partner isn't always going to be the best sex ever, but they better be close. I don't know how long you see yourself with your current SO, but getting a dildo to feel something larger sounds like a stopgap measure. Sorry I don't have much in the way of advice.

"], [-1, "[deleted]"], [-3, "I hear all the replies saying to tread lightly, and I agree, especially if you love your bf. \n\nI know this won't seen as politically correct here, but you deserve to hear a woman's experience and a different point of view. For me, sex with an attractive, hung man is just incredible - such an amazing feeling of fullness, then soon after, a long string of increasingly powerful climaxes that I find almost earth-shattering. Your saying sex is okay tells me you haven't had that kind of experience. To me, it's probably a size thing. It's not just me - almost all of my friends, when they're honest about it, admit they prefer a much larger penis all other things being equal. They can hit the right spots, and that full feeling is simply divine. The orgasms also are much better. It only makes sense - I figured out most of the guys I sleep with are about 10 or more times bigger than my husband overall, and my husband is a similar size to your bf. Of course I'm going to feel that difference and miss it when I don't have it. I bet you do, too, but you just don't know it because of lack of experience. You just haven't been with bigger or truly hung guys, so you don't know. One hint - if the thought of a bigger or truly hung penis gets you curious or excited, then the odds you'll find it a life-changing experience go way up. In any event, whether it's size or something else, if you haven't had that kind of experience, you're missing out. You owe it to yourself to find out why.  \n\nOne point of logic - it's impossible for you to know if you're missing out because of your bf's size without being with men whose cocks are bigger - probably more than one. That doesn't mean you should do go outside the relationship or end it to find out - it does mean the question will linger if you don't find a way to experience what your bf lacks.  \n\nAs for me, I was in a somewhat similar situation, in that my husband has an extremely small penis, about three quarters of an inch less than your bf on his best day, and quit thin. That's where the similarities might end. At the beginning of our relationship, my now-husband already knew of my fetish for larger penises, but he pursued me anyway. So the difference is, he insisted that even though we have a relationship, that if I need to, I get what I need sexually from other guys - just don't tell him. And I've taken him up on that and have sex with bigger quys quite often. He's renewed that request a number of times. So it's possible to love a man completely, have sex with other men who fill that specific need, if you have it, and have everything be fine. I wouldn't bet on it, but maybe your boyfriend is one of those guys who fantasizes about this kind of thing. They aren't that rare. It could be that you wouldn't be into bigger guys - there is only one way to know. I think it's worth exploring with your boyfriend in a very gentle way, and seeing if he can take the lead on suggesting you try with other guys. If you break up for other reasons, well then you should seek out other, larger guys for casual sex, so at least you'll know.

It could be curiosity about what it'd be like to be with a partner with more common interests/hobbies. It could be that your partner is not the best conversationalist in the world and you wonder what it'd be like to be with a really witty extroverted social butterfly. It could be that your girlfriend doesn't have the most curves and you wonder how much better it'd be with a girl with fuller breasts or a bigger ass. It could be anything.\n\nBut the common denominator is wondering about what else is out there.\n\nThe truth is that everyone you date is going to have some really good aspects and some weaknesses. So if you started dating a different guy his cock size might make PIV somewhat better, but he might be a bit dull outside the bedroom. Or he might have anger issues. Or he might be broke and lack ambition.\n\nThe point is, you have to decide what things are negotiable and what things are non-negotiable.\n\nUnfortunately it's often really hard to make that judgment when you don't have much experience.\n\nMy first LTR was dynamite in bed, I loved her body so much, and she was always in a good mood, fun, and happy but sometimes I felt like we didn't have enough in common intellectually. I ended up breaking up with her to explore, but I never told her 'yeah I just get too bored when we're hanging out alone and I feel like we don't have enough to talk about'.\n\nInstead I gave a generic reason that wouldn't hurt her ego.\n\nShe was my first sex partner and first relationship, looking back she definitely was overall better than most of the people I've been with since then. I've come to realize that some of her positive personality traits that I overlooked are actually really important to me.\n\nBut at the same time I've been with some women who were much more interesting to talk to.\n\nUltimately I'm still at an age where I'm looking for someone who's better than all the rest.\n\nThe point is, there's no real way to win here except to get lucky and find someone who truly is better in every way. But it's usually much healthier to avoid comparing your partner to others and instead focus on their positives. Chances are if you guys break up you'll end up finding someone else to love. Chances are also that if you stay with him you'll have a good relationship.\n\nI really would advise against suggesting a threesome or a cock extender or anything like that. It seems cruel to me to hurt his ego in that way when there's a chance you'll end up dumping him afterwards anyway.\n\nIn my opinion you have to decide for yourself and then if you decide to break up, don't give him the painful truth just give him a little speech about how you still want to find yourself, need to experience more, blah blah and just compliment him the whole time you are breaking up.", "id": "cxudkyy"}, {"comment": "Thank you for the very thorough response.

My first gf in high school lost her virginity with me. Now I'm fairly average, 5.5\", and I was well aware that there are guys out there with big dicks. Most average guys are very conscious of this and i was no different. I was slightly in secure about it but at the same time, i wasn't disillusioned that so long as I kept her away from those guys she'll never know any better. \n\nSo 5 months into the relationship, she tells me about her curiosity over bigger dicks, not asking permission, just mentioned she wondered what it would feel like. I, an immature 15 year old, blew it out of proportion, and we got into a fight, which lead to other fights and started souring the relationship. But, like a desperate 15 year old, I finally agreed to a three way with a \"stranger\" (known acquaintance, never a friend kind of guy) who was rumored to have a horse cock (he did). lets call him bob\n\nBecause of the bad communication, how immature I was, how the decision was made out of desperation, not out of mutual interest, my first threeway ended my relationship, and she started a short relationship with bob. This  blew my self consciousness into full blown self loathing, and it took a long time and a few really good friends to get me out of it.\n\nHere's the kicker, after said ex broke up with bob, and I could speak to him again (this was like 2 years later), he told me that she actually never really enjoyed it after that first time. She told him that because of the anticipation, how she was so thinking about it for weeks, she was so into the idea that it was explosive for her that first time. But after that, each time they had sex, it didn't measure up, and most times it hurt like a bitch, hence why they broke up.\n\nThe point is this; I think approaching your boyfriend to discover this curiosity s going to be imperative to your relationship, but be careful how to get him to participate. It's perfectly natural and normal to want to experience new partners, and unless you try you will never know if his 4inches is enough for you, but he needs to be a part of it. The only way to get rid of this itch is to scratch it, and I hope you can get him to help you discover more of your sexual preference.\n\nAnd if you find it is for you, don't worry it doesn't mean you're out of options. There are enhancements, and toys that you can bring into your sex life to fulfill this need. A past partner of mine used to get these cravings to be filled up, but was not comfortable with other people, so we bought a penis sleeve for me to better satisfy her when she wanted it.

You don't have to be great or even good at something, you just have to enjoy it. When you improve, you feel good; when you make a mistake or fail, you're learning so you can improve later. You want to enjoy it regardless of success, so failure doesn't hurt. Failure is the prelude to improvement and success. The other, related reason is this: When people are enjoying themselves, they are incredibly attractive.\n\nImproving yourself in this way makes a notable difference in how other people see you. A positive outlook and uplifting attitude is appreciated by everyone. If you're happy with yourself, you can appear content and confident, it will be seen in your body language. At this point, engaging and interacting with others will be easier. The difference is that *they* will *want* to interact with *you*. When you're asked what you're into, you'll have something to talk about, something you're truly interested in and excited about; it's an attractive feature. And even if nothing comes from it, at least you've found a way to keep yourself happy, engaged and occupied."], [-1, "The confidence comments are spot on.

It'll reduce nervousness, and you might just meet someone.\n\nIf you're introverted I suggest you sign up for organized activities. It means you'll automatically come into contact with women (no need to initiate contact), and you'll have something in common to talk about (the activity). Choose some activity you enjoy, but also something that has many women present. Some suggestions:\n\n- help out at an animal shelter (waaay more women than men);\n- museums often offer art courses - painting, photography, etc\n- sign up for co-ed sport. Meet-up here in Houston has co-ed tennis, soccer, softball, etc. TBH Meet-up has a lot of stuff.\n- Evening lectures on topics that attract you. Universities often do these.\n- Salsa course\n\nThrow yourself out there. Broaden your network.

On this ARK, which runs off of solar energy, the people's lives will be digitally simulated for hundreds of thousands of years. They'll have anything they want instantly, even simulated children. They would never grow old, never hunger, never die, until the hardware crapped out and the simulation failed to continue running.\n\nThe ARK is either a metaphor for heaven, or an understandable example of what would happen if humans finally beat death and attained some kind of immortality; however, while playing the game, Markiplier said \"That's so sad.\" This is that thing that many people spend their entire lives trying to do (not die, or at least go to heaven), but here is this guy seeing it play out for what it is, and it's sad.\n\nHis reasoning was along the lines of \"These people are going to go on existing, floating through space, with no purpose, until eventually the hardware breaks down, and they all slowly die away.\", at which point I literally yelled at the screen \"THEN WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?\"\n\nTurns out, in a later episode, he actually had a response to that question, after seeing it pop up all over his subreddit. I think his response really showed why he is the way that he is. I think maybe everybody's response to that type of question really says a lot about them, because the answer is basically the reason why you continue to exist. Which would you rather live on? The Modern Earth or this futuristic ARK? Is there a difference? What is it?\n\nMarkiplier's response was that, sure, he WILL eventually die, but during his life, he'll hopefully affect people in a positive way so that the world after his death is better than the world before his life. On the ARK, there isn't anything after you. Just you, and all the self-satisfaction you could ever want, making it seem.... kind of silly. Kind of pointless.\n\nI think the only thing that gives meaning to existence is that you don't get what you want. You and your aquaintences will never run out of goals, of plans, of struggles, of failures, because, if you ever did, you wouldn't grow, you wouldn't live.\n\nI don't know why you dislike yourself. From my experience with my freinds and myself, I think a lot of those emotions come from moments that used to be consious, but have been tucked so far back that they're no longer concious reminders, they're more like physical reactions. Similar to how, when you're an infant learning to walk, you fall a lot because your body and mind haven't built the reactions you need to stay steady, but when you're grown up, a little push can create all kinds of physical reactions that you don't even realize are happening until they're already over.\n\nI know a lot of people that deal with those emotions, the kinds that pop up and take over before you can figure out what's making you feel crazy. They use a lot words with emotional baggage like \"non-existent\" \"worthless\" \"kill myself\" to really dig into those feelings. The worst one is when you feel depressed, feel less depressed, then feel depressed again and still use the terms \"always\" or \"never\" to describe how you feel, even when it's not completely true.\n\nThere's a lot of struggling with mental illnesses, and I don't reccommend that anyone be little it. At the same time, we all struggle with a lot, because if we didn't, we wouldn't be alive. Truth is, if you have a roof over your head and a way to access this website, your life is technically better than 90% of the World's population.

Happiness from suddenly enjoying the things I do get to have. I guess, by this point, the biggest thing I've lost faith in is my ability to control anyone or anything. I feel powerless, but after giving up my power over everything, the world has gotten a lot easier to deal with.\n\nI read a comment recently about mindfulness that suggested that this willingness to allow the world to be itself is part of Buddhist teachings, and I can understand why.

Did you really grow up and become an adult without any interpersonal friction?\n\nShe's not getting what she wants from you, ergo, she has no reason to associate with you, especially as you weren't close and the relationship has been tainted, whether by your aggression and accusation of wanting to get you to cheat when she backed off due to not being comfortable discussing fucking you with your wife or because she was, as you state, plotting to steal you from your wife for some reason. I must confess, I'm curious as to how you found that out, all things considered, as it sounds more like you're jumping to a conclusion based upon your biases considering your reliance upon \"signals\" and your need to butt into your wife's side dalliances instead of letting her break things off herself.\n\nSurely you've also heard about how some women go through life, never having heard the word no before, so what's the difficulty in seeing that in play here and elsewhere?

I said that my wife and I are not arrogant to think that the thought of sex with others doesn't appeal.  That can still be the case in a monogamous relationship.  You can recognise that your partner does and always will find other people attractive, it's just that in a monogamous relationship you choose to be monogamous.  It is also completely true that there are relationships out there where each individual seems to think that the opposite is true, and I find that to be a form of arrogance.\n\nThere are 7 billion people on earth, roughly half of them the gender which you are attracted to, double that if you are bi.  To think that in that pool of potential partners you are the only person your partner could find attractive and would want to have sex with is arrogance in the highest degree, and completely illogical if you yourself (and please be clear I mean you generally, not you specifically) have engaged in a dating life and had more than one partner.\n\nHowever, that is off topic, and I was merely setting out some backstory as, in my experience, a lot of monogamous people seem to think that because we are not monogamous something must be wrong or that we will screw anything that moves, it was not meant to be the primary focus of the post and was meant to discourage conversation about THAT particular facet of the relationship.  It was not meant to be condescending.\n\nThat said, yes, I am completely aware of the type of woman this woman is, at least NOW I am.  I have dealt with more than my fair share of interpersonal friction, and have seen this kind of behaviour before.  But I wasn't really looking for an explanation, I guess my question was rhetorical and I was looking to start a discussion.\n\nWHY are people like that.  And WHY can't people just be straight, particularly when one half of the equation, ie us, isn't judging.  Going back to the guy who wasn't showing my wife respect, like I said, if he had just been upfront and said \"look, this is just sex, I will call you when my dick is hard\", then we were fine with that.  Why dress it up as something more?\n\nAgain, I am not looking for answers, I am trying to promote discussion.\n\nLastly, I do not like, however you meant it, the term aggression.

If we're not having sex at some point, I'll use a tampon and my partner never misses out on anything any day of the month. That's just my experience.\n\nMany women and I used to feel this way, are self-conscious that there may be an odor, even when using a tampon. The menstrual blood itself has no smell, but when it mixes with the body, the tissue shedding from the uterus, vaginal fluids, and sweat, bacteria and odor may develop. Especially so in the trapped blood in hygiene products. \n\nI became aware of the lack of odor and became more comfortable being with my partner. After a shower, mid cycle, I stuck two fingers inside myself, put it to my nose, and I smelled nothing. Since I use a fresh tampon prior to being with my partner, there is no issue with longer term accumulated blood odor and my partner says he doesn't smell anything but \"sexy\". And I know he isn't referring to my period. We communicate openly and don't want to have an unpleasant/awkward experience. \n\nI was married 13y to a man who was hands off when I had my period. I felt like something was wrong with me. Now I met a man who has a healthy outlook on sexuality and has made everything easy and I have never felt more comfortable in my own body and am confident with my sexuality. \n\nI don't know her insecurity, but I hope this helps. Be gentle, sensitive, and very patient. When she is on her period, you are not in bed, nor expecting anything, say, \"I am going to give you a compliment and I don't want you to react, okay?\" Only when she agrees do you continue, \"You are so beautiful, no....you are beautiful and especially sexy and turn me on.....(count to 3 while looking in her eyes) that's what I wanted you to know.\" Kiss her on the forehead and go take a cold shower. She may or may not associate your compliment with her period. Do it once the first month. The following month do the same thing. Of course, express loving and appreciative sentiments other times during the month. The purpose of this is for her to see that you are seriously attracted and turned on by her during a time she isn't trusting herself, but maybe should trust your perspective. Your expectations are to get nothing out of it for the first few months and if she offers something out of the ordinary (bj, sex), \"Lisa, I just wanted you to know how you make me feel. You're sexy as fuck and I love you the way you are. Understand?\"\n\nYou can gauge your wife best. The next month she offers, say the same thing but add, \"I only ever want you to do what you are comfortable with. We don't need to talk about it now.\" Kiss her on the neck. Slow and steady with the golden tongue will make the wife a happier more confident woman who has no black out dates.\n\n\n\nNote: I only experience minimal cramping prior to and sometimes during my period which is easily taken care of with otc meds. \n\nI feel for the women who go through the myriad of hormonal, psychological, and physical changes and pains associated with their  cycle.

That's just my experience.\n\nMany women and I used to feel this way, are self-conscious that there may be an odor, even when using a tampon. The menstrual blood itself has no smell, but when it mixes with the body, the tissue shedding from the uterus, vaginal fluids, and sweat, bacteria and odor may develop. Especially so in the trapped blood in hygiene products. \n\nI became aware of the lack of odor and became more comfortable being with my partner. After a shower, mid cycle, I stuck two fingers inside myself, put it to my nose, and I smelled nothing. Since I use a fresh tampon prior to being with my partner, there is no issue with longer term accumulated blood odor and my partner says he doesn't smell anything but \"sexy\". And I know he isn't referring to my period. We communicate openly and don't want to have an unpleasant/awkward experience. \n\nI was married 13y to a man who was hands off when I had my period. I felt like something was wrong with me. Now I met a man who has a healthy outlook on sexuality and has made everything easy and I have never felt more comfortable in my own body and am confident with my sexuality. \n\nI don't know her insecurity, but I hope this helps. Be gentle, sensitive, and very patient. When she is on her period, you are not in bed, nor expecting anything, say, \"I am going to give you a compliment and I don't want you to react, okay?\" Only when she agrees do you continue, \"You are so beautiful, no....you are beautiful and especially sexy and turn me on.....(count to 3 while looking in her eyes) that's what I wanted you to know.\" Kiss her on the forehead and go take a cold shower. She may or may not associate your compliment with her period. Do it once the first month. The following month do the same thing. Of course, express loving and appreciative sentiments other times during the month. The purpose of this is for her to see that you are seriously attracted and turned on by her during a time she isn't trusting herself, but maybe should trust your perspective. Your expectations are to get nothing out of it for the first few months and if she offers something out of the ordinary (bj, sex), \"Lisa, I just wanted you to know how you make me feel. You're sexy as fuck and I love you the way you are. Understand?\"\n\nYou can gauge your wife best. The next month she offers, say the same thing but add, \"I only ever want you to do what you are comfortable with. We don't need to talk about it now.\" Kiss her on the neck. Slow and steady with the golden tongue will make the wife a happier more confident woman who has no black out dates.\n\n\n\nNote: I only experience minimal cramping prior to and sometimes during my period which is easily taken care of with otc meds. \n\nI feel for the women who go through the myriad of hormonal, psychological, and physical changes and pains associated with their  cycle.

Ugh, middle school.) and also struggling with self worth throughout my life.\n\nIt's okay for my partner to be forceful or passionate or spank me, but when I hear bitch or slut or cunt, my brain says \"he doesn't respect you, he thinks you're just some easy piece of ass, you're gross/worthless\" etc. Even if my husband, who I KNOW loves me, were to say that, I would instantly tense and lose my interest in having sex. It's something I have not been able to turn off. It makes me feel bad. ", "id": "czzoy5m"}], [{"comment": "Just because someone is wet that doesn't mean they are necessarily enjoying the sex or that they don't feel violated. If a man is being sexually abused by someone, it might involuntarily trigger an erection; that doesn't mean that it's not abuse. Sex is abuse when it is not consensual. No matter what kind of sex it is, if it's not consensual, it's abuse - even if they appear physically aroused.\n\nIt is *vitally* important that you get permission from your partner before you do any of these things. Don't just wing it and assume that it's fine or that her lack of an explicit 'no' means she consents. Some people really enjoy the kind of animalistic sex you're describing, some people don't; every individual is different and you really shouldn't assume that just because some women enjoy it all of them do. And even if you are with someone who likes that kind of sex, they might not like it all of the time. Lack of a no is not enough, you need explicit consent throughout.\n\nYou can still enjoy this kind of sex while being a considerate lover. A safeword system is a must if you want to experiment with dominance play or consensual non-consent. It might not be your favourite thing in the world, but it's about making sure people don't get hurt like she was. Think about it from her perspective; that experience left her crying. Being sexually violated is an emotionally damaging experience, and it's incredibly important to make sure that doesn't happen. If taking the necessary precautions to make sure you don't violate someone (albeit inadvertently) turns you off, tough. It's not at all acceptable to simply put your own desires first without considering those of your partner. \n\nI don't think that you meant to hurt her, but understand that it's absolutely not okay to do that without consent. I hope that you can patch things up with her properly. Sit down with her and talk about what her boundaries are, and don't cross them.

I don't really know where you should go to find support, but keep looking for somebody to talk to.

You got yourself into a mess, but you also got yourself out of it. That's awesome. \n\nLastly. You are a 15 year old gay kid. You probably aren't ready for that level of sex right now.

I did wear makeup more regularly when my SO and I started dating, but once I got comfortable being myself around him I went back to my normal routine. In all honesty, I don't get a lot of personal enjoyment from wearing makeup. I am most likely to wear it in a situation where I feel like I am going to be judged and valued based on my appearance. Some examples are interviews, first dates, first few days (weeks?) at a new job, giving presentations at work, getting drinks with friends/coworkers after work, going to meetings, going to nice restaurants, and meeting up with my SO's family. For me, it isn't necessarily about looking hot and definitely not about getting into a sexy situation. I had honestly never ever thought about the relationship between removing/not removing makeup and having sex with an established partner until reading your post. On a day when I'm wearing makeup, if my SO and I have sex at some point before getting ready for bed then I will have makeup on during sex. I will remove my makeup before going to bed, just as I will have removed my clothes and jewelry and brushed my teeth. If we have sex after getting ready for bed, then there will be no makeup involved. It's that simple. Removing it is just part of my nightly routine, and being asked to wait to do that until after sex would seem as strange to me as being asked to not floss until after sex. And honestly I would probably be hurt by it as well. Taking the opportunity to have some fun when I was already dressed up a bit and wearing makeup would be one thing, but asking me to alter my nightly routine to ensure that I was wearing makeup during sex would make me feel like my SO didn't find me attractive without it.

You were also asking how others think of their makeup in relation to sex and haven't gotten as many replies on that front, so here's my two cents there. \n\nI don't wear makeup every day, and what makeup I do wear is pretty subtle. I did wear makeup more regularly when my SO and I started dating, but once I got comfortable being myself around him I went back to my normal routine. In all honesty, I don't get a lot of personal enjoyment from wearing makeup. I am most likely to wear it in a situation where I feel like I am going to be judged and valued based on my appearance. Some examples are interviews, first dates, first few days (weeks?) at a new job, giving presentations at work, getting drinks with friends/coworkers after work, going to meetings, going to nice restaurants, and meeting up with my SO's family. For me, it isn't necessarily about looking hot and definitely not about getting into a sexy situation. I had honestly never ever thought about the relationship between removing/not removing makeup and having sex with an established partner until reading your post. On a day when I'm wearing makeup, if my SO and I have sex at some point before getting ready for bed then I will have makeup on during sex. I will remove my makeup before going to bed, just as I will have removed my clothes and jewelry and brushed my teeth. If we have sex after getting ready for bed, then there will be no makeup involved. It's that simple. Removing it is just part of my nightly routine, and being asked to wait to do that until after sex would seem as strange to me as being asked to not floss until after sex. And honestly I would probably be hurt by it as well. Taking the opportunity to have some fun when I was already dressed up a bit and wearing makeup would be one thing, but asking me to alter my nightly routine to ensure that I was wearing makeup during sex would make me feel like my SO didn't find me attractive without it.

You say this relationship is perfect otherwise. Well I'm sorry to break it up to you but it isn't because you are clearly torn.

It really isn't as easy as the guys trolling Reddit would have you believe. She's beautiful, and we suspect that might be part of the problem. If you come on too hard, you'll be met with skepticism and suspicion. It's just a once in a while thing we do, but we've tried regular bars, sports bars and strip joints. You'd think strip clubs would be a slam dunk, but they're actually more full of mostly faithful husbands from out of town... happy to watch naked women while away from the wife, but not really mentally prepared for anything more. Try some of the swinger sites if nothing else. Or, hell, if you're nearby, come visit us lol. I like younger women as much as you like older men. Really, all older men do. But, generally... favor real life over web sites, look for single over married, and temper your approach. You really can't just go swinging your pussy around as one suggested. Start with small talk and see if there's a mutual vibe (sex is better that way anyhow.) If it isn't there, cut bait and move on. If it is, you'll know it... and you'll know he knows it too.

Real life is harder than web sites, but then you get back to the saying about \"anything worth having...\". If super simple is what you want, just head to craigslist. It's even free. But beware what you'll find there. Depending on how big a city you live in, you can check out swinglifestyle, sdc or adultfriendfinder. 3nder is an app I've seen but have never used. These sites offer free accounts, but you generally have to pay for them to be useful. But then again, would you really want to hook up with anyone that wouldn't even pay $20 to be on a site? It's a quality over quantity thing. And since it all ends up in real life eventually, my experience says it's better if it also starts in real life. With that said, we've had great experiences with people we initially met online. Post an ad or a profile, strike up conversations, weed out the losers, and if you EVER meet anyone live that you met online, ALWAYS first meet them some place public. Never accept a guy's invitation to his pad that you've never met in person. There's just a lot more due diligence you have to do with someone you've never met beyond a keyboard.

He came to live with us after he graduated high school. He took an opportunity to kiss me one night while everyone was sleeping and it led to some other teasing and touching. Like I said, when he tried to put his dick in me I very clearly said no and pushed him away three separate times. I straight up told him \"I don't want to have sex.\" You can't get any more clear than that. I couldn't exactly kick and scream cause I would've woken the whole house up and that would've cause a whole whirlwind of other problems, especially with my raging alcoholic step-mom. So I gave up. I let him do it cause it was the easy way out. It didn't feel right, but once I tuned out for a minute and he entered me without my consent I figured that was it. What was the point in trying again? \n\nHe wasn't my boyfriend and I didn't want to continue things with him, but he coerced me into sneaking around and continuing to have sex for a few months. I used to be super shy back then. He played on my feelings and emotions in order to get what he wanted. The sex we had was very much about just getting him off. I was just a fuck toy. It never felt right, but I had the same thought process of \"what's the point in stopping him.\" He started having problems with his mom, fighting a lot, then went to visit his dad for Christmas. The day he came back he packed up all his stuff and moved back to his dad's in another state. I slipped him a note to at least call me or write me, but I've never heard from him ever since. That really told me that he didn't care about me, that he was just using me. I struggled to make sense of the whole thing for a long time until I was mature enough to realize he was just manipulating me. \n\nTo this day I still struggle with sex being focused on me. It's hard for me to relax and to not have the sex be about just getting my partner off. But for the record, I'm getting better about that and I am otherwise confident in my sexuality.

Very few people know about this experience because it was hard to get past feeling violated by my step-brother. It had nothing to do with regret or feeling upset that he left me. It had to do with the fact that he pushed me past my limit when I very clearly told him no multiple times then took advantage of my silence and shyness to get what he wanted.

At that time, no one was talking about transgender issues, so I can't say it was something I really thought about then.\n\nIt is something I've thought about now though.  I wouldn't seek out a transgendered person, in part because fetishizing another person is no way to start a relationship.

Which isn't to say you have to act like nothing bothers you, but own your flaws and mistakes, don't let them bother you.\n\nFlirting is amazing, witty little nothings offered and rescinded just as fast.  In my experience flirting was better than some of the actual sex I had.  When you have people you are attracted to and feel comfortable with, flirting is great.  And it can be an easy way for people to kind of subtly escalate things between them, whether an actual date or something racier.\n\nI would say though not to worry too much about trying to have sex, speaking as someone who has historically put too much of my self-worth into being in a sexual relationship.  My worst relationships (and decisions) came when I was down on myself and feeling alone; whereas many of my best relationships (and sexy-times) came when I was feeling more positive.  The best sexy-times came for me when I was open to it, but not actively looking.\n\nFinally, regarding how I feel about trans-women.  When I was around 16 I don't know how I would have dealt with the situation.  At that time, no one was talking about transgender issues, so I can't say it was something I really thought about then.\n\nIt is something I've thought about now though.  I wouldn't seek out a transgendered person, in part because fetishizing another person is no way to start a relationship.  But if I was single and had a friend that I clicked with, the fact that they were transgendered wouldn't turn me away.  Honestly, it would be something I'd want to talk about beforehand (which isn't a bad idea for any kind of sexual relationship), but people are people ;) and if the attraction is there why turn down a good time if everyone is on board?\n\nSorry if this is all kind of rambling, I hope there's some pieces of experience here that may help you; and I wish you luck in finding what you're looking for.", "id": "d92t4m0"}], [{"comment": "The first thing you should do is discover yourself, how do you imagine yourself having sex?

Because I invest so much in the relationship \u2014 sex aside, there's pursuit, time, effort, attention, listening, other things too. That's how I make *my* case.\n\nIf a partner of mine invested a similar amount in the relationship \u2014 or even just a fraction as much \u2014 then I'd probably feel less like I was competing all the time.

Women need to be respecting themselves and learning to be comfortable and confident with their bodies. And using positive terminology.\n\nYou were obviously fortunate.

The few times it might be acceptable to use those terms would be in the context of explaining why they are derogatory. For instance in a classroom. Or in therapy. And sometimes in BDSM with discussion among partners regarding boundaries. Even their \"dirty talk\" stops with derogatory terms. \n\nIt's important that women learn to respect themselves and each other. Because men often use those terms freely to make them feel better about themselves, dominant, and superior. \n\nThe terms are often used to refer to women who have been raped and abused or women who have been abducted, and forced into prostitution against their will as slaves. Many of these girls are the girls you see in the porn that so ubiquitous with today's technology. This is still very much happening all over the world and very much in the backyards of America.\n\nYour questions are important questions to ask. An important distinctions to be made.\n\nSex is about intimacy. It's about being with someone that you care for as much as yourself. Someone you trust. Someone who is earned the privilege to have access to your body. Someone you want to share your body with because you respect them for who they are and they respect you for who you are.

Women need to be respecting themselves and learning to be comfortable and confident with their bodies. And using positive terminology.\n\nYou were obviously fortunate.

Even their \"dirty talk\" stops with derogatory terms. \n\nIt's important that women learn to respect themselves and each other. Because men often use those terms freely to make them feel better about themselves, dominant, and superior. \n\nThe terms are often used to refer to women who have been raped and abused or women who have been abducted, and forced into prostitution against their will as slaves.

Also, some douchebag at your work doesn't have the right, nor is qualified, to appraise your value as a person. This is kind of a long story but it has a point, I promise.\n\nIn my life, the times I've been the most down on myself are the times when I've been the least successful with women. And it really does exacerbate the problem, it's a negative feedback loop. I know it can and often does seem impossible to break out of. It seems like some guys are successful with women as if they know some trick, like somehow, the less they care, the more successful they are. It's frustrating.\n\nIt took me a long time to figure things out, insofar as finding what works for me and why. I was at a low point, in a city I had no cause to be in anymore after losing a long term relationship and being laid off at work. I was depressed, suffering PTSD symptoms related to my army service, and wasn't sleeping. I put on and lost weight. There was really nothing for me, it seemed. I kind of slogged forward only because I didn't know what else to do. So much of my identity and self-worth were tied to this other person, who was now gone.\n\nI got some help from going to a doctor, who gave me Trazodone to help with my anxiety and sleep problems. With that done, I was about to fail school as well to add on to the heap, so I took some time to get out of town (to visit my grandma of all things). I had some peace and quiet, and mostly to catch up on my school work. And I did catch up. It felt good to have a win, when previously it had been a win just to get out of bed, or take a shower. I did some quiet reflection. Did I really hate myself, or just how I felt? Was I really nothing, or did I just disastrously tie my self-worth to something out of my control?\n\nI was in control of myself, I reasoned. I thought of some qualities in myself that I liked, and I got mad...I resented how I had been treated and how it made me feel about myself as a result. \"I'm a good dude, I'm smart, and caring, and fuck her for making me feel otherwise.\" I wanted some more wins. I wanted to work on me, and prove her life decisions wrong as a result. So I started, slowly I admit. I passed my classes (a B, and two C's, but passing is passing). I moved back to my hometown. I went to the gym, and continued with school. I started a new hobby. This wasn't all boom-boom-boom, rapid fire, it was months in between. But those little wins were starting to add up.\n\nI started out doing this to prove something to someone else, but as time went on it was less and less for proving my ex wrong, and more and more about growing as a person. About improving myself in small ways, because I wanted to like who I am. This is basically treating myself with the love I was looking for exclusively from other people. Seeking that love only from others does two things: it hurts your identity and confidence, which as we both know is detrimental to social and romantic interactions...and two, it sets you up to be really hurt when you either don't get that love from them or have it taken away suddenly.\n\nSo here I was, having crawled, then walked, and my version of running in this story is my taking care of and loving myself allowed me to get over and forgive my ex, because it was doing me harm not to. And it was oddly freeing during all this time, not trying to date or anything, just working on me. I kind of stopped caring about what other people thought of the things I did and liked. I look crazy wearing giant gaming headphones with a mic on, so what. I love Star Trek, deal with it. I have Lego on my shelf, well I think they're cool. I'm tired of hiding things or making excuses for them.\n\nI carried that with me when I started dating again. And that aloof \"I don't care\" attitude? I had it. I had confidence in myself, and knew what I'm about as a person, my likes, my personal philosophy. I didn't use it as a way to manipulate as some guys do. It was just that someone trashing me or what I like no longer outweighed the value I placed in myself. I *like* shitty action movies, I play D&D because I *have fun* doing it...don't like it? \"That's too bad, you're missing out,\" and I'd move on. And it's amazing how differently things go when you have the confidence to go, \"This is me. I'm pretty cool in my own ways. If you're into that, awesome. If not, no skin off my nose.\"\n\nShit sucks right now. And even if you don't view my story as impossible, it took a long time. I'm 31 now, and I won't lie to you, I've found no shortcuts, no silver bullets. There's not \"this one crazy trick\" like the internet would have us believe. But there is help to be had if you're willing to take it. I didn't do anything on my own, I saw a counselor, I took meds, I leaned on my family and friends. I did the heavy lifting and you will too, because someone else can't come in and fix everything, but it's okay to seek help and support.\n\nAnd there is a lot more to this life than sticking ones dick inside someone else, I promise you that. Having sex for the first time turned out not to be a very formative experience. I was like, \"Huh. Okay, put a check mark in that box then.\" Scuba diving for the first time was more fun, honestly. Learn a skill, build something, do some traveling. Sex is a fundamental, but very narrow, part of the human condition. Experience some more of the rest of it before you decide it's not worth it. The odds are overwhelmingly that sex will follow at some point, and it won't define you then. Why let it define you now, you know?\n\nI'm sorry if this is rambling or unhelpful.

I still feel bad about being a Virgin but I don't feel so bad about it as I used to. Another way I managed to improve my self esteem was by going to the gym. Exercise is a great anti-depressant and gets a lot easy the more you go. It also helps if you go without someone. But what really helps me manage to be happy about myself is my hobbies. Find something you love and make the most of it. All your other problems in life won't seem so bad. I'm introverted though so I can be happy just chilling out and home playing racing games and shooters. If you are extroverted it might be a good idea to find a hobby that involves doing stuff with other people.\n\nThe important thing to remeber is that this is just the way you feel now.

I am a black girl that moved to a predominantly white neighborhood and went to a pretty much white high school. I know what it's like to be told you are not hot/attractive based on something you can't change. I felt ugly all through high school because everyone thought I wasn't pretty enough for anyone to want to be with me. I went to school dances without a date. Junior prom I didn't even go because no one asked me and I didn't want to feel like the looser without a date. Senior Prom I went without a date. While girls talked about the guys they hooked up with and all, I awkwardly sat there hating myself for not being pretty enough for any guy to want to be with me.  I know the feelings you are talking about all too well. For the longest time I felt ugly because I wasn't the \"right skin tone\".\n\nKilling yourself because you are a virgin is not the way to go.

Also, some douchebag at your work doesn't have the right, nor is qualified, to appraise your value as a person. This is kind of a long story but it has a point, I promise.\n\nIn my life, the times I've been the most down on myself are the times when I've been the least successful with women. And it really does exacerbate the problem, it's a negative feedback loop. I know it can and often does seem impossible to break out of. It seems like some guys are successful with women as if they know some trick, like somehow, the less they care, the more successful they are. It's frustrating.\n\nIt took me a long time to figure things out, insofar as finding what works for me and why. I was at a low point, in a city I had no cause to be in anymore after losing a long term relationship and being laid off at work. I was depressed, suffering PTSD symptoms related to my army service, and wasn't sleeping. I put on and lost weight. There was really nothing for me, it seemed. I kind of slogged forward only because I didn't know what else to do. So much of my identity and self-worth were tied to this other person, who was now gone.\n\nI got some help from going to a doctor, who gave me Trazodone to help with my anxiety and sleep problems. With that done, I was about to fail school as well to add on to the heap, so I took some time to get out of town (to visit my grandma of all things). I had some peace and quiet, and mostly to catch up on my school work. And I did catch up. It felt good to have a win, when previously it had been a win just to get out of bed, or take a shower. I did some quiet reflection. Did I really hate myself, or just how I felt? Was I really nothing, or did I just disastrously tie my self-worth to something out of my control?\n\nI was in control of myself, I reasoned. I thought of some qualities in myself that I liked, and I got mad...I resented how I had been treated and how it made me feel about myself as a result. \"I'm a good dude, I'm smart, and caring, and fuck her for making me feel otherwise.\" I wanted some more wins. I wanted to work on me, and prove her life decisions wrong as a result. So I started, slowly I admit. I passed my classes (a B, and two C's, but passing is passing). I moved back to my hometown. I went to the gym, and continued with school. I started a new hobby. This wasn't all boom-boom-boom, rapid fire, it was months in between. But those little wins were starting to add up.\n\nI started out doing this to prove something to someone else, but as time went on it was less and less for proving my ex wrong, and more and more about growing as a person. About improving myself in small ways, because I wanted to like who I am. This is basically treating myself with the love I was looking for exclusively from other people. Seeking that love only from others does two things: it hurts your identity and confidence, which as we both know is detrimental to social and romantic interactions...and two, it sets you up to be really hurt when you either don't get that love from them or have it taken away suddenly.\n\nSo here I was, having crawled, then walked, and my version of running in this story is my taking care of and loving myself allowed me to get over and forgive my ex, because it was doing me harm not to. And it was oddly freeing during all this time, not trying to date or anything, just working on me. I kind of stopped caring about what other people thought of the things I did and liked. I look crazy wearing giant gaming headphones with a mic on, so what. I love Star Trek, deal with it. I have Lego on my shelf, well I think they're cool. I'm tired of hiding things or making excuses for them.\n\nI carried that with me when I started dating again. And that aloof \"I don't care\" attitude? I had it. I had confidence in myself, and knew what I'm about as a person, my likes, my personal philosophy. I didn't use it as a way to manipulate as some guys do. It was just that someone trashing me or what I like no longer outweighed the value I placed in myself. I *like* shitty action movies, I play D&D because I *have fun* doing it...don't like it? \"That's too bad, you're missing out,\" and I'd move on. And it's amazing how differently things go when you have the confidence to go, \"This is me. I'm pretty cool in my own ways. If you're into that, awesome. If not, no skin off my nose.\"\n\nShit sucks right now. And even if you don't view my story as impossible, it took a long time. I'm 31 now, and I won't lie to you, I've found no shortcuts, no silver bullets. There's not \"this one crazy trick\" like the internet would have us believe. But there is help to be had if you're willing to take it. I didn't do anything on my own, I saw a counselor, I took meds, I leaned on my family and friends. I did the heavy lifting and you will too, because someone else can't come in and fix everything, but it's okay to seek help and support.\n\nAnd there is a lot more to this life than sticking ones dick inside someone else, I promise you that. Having sex for the first time turned out not to be a very formative experience. I was like, \"Huh. Okay, put a check mark in that box then.\" Scuba diving for the first time was more fun, honestly. Learn a skill, build something, do some traveling. Sex is a fundamental, but very narrow, part of the human condition. Experience some more of the rest of it before you decide it's not worth it. The odds are overwhelmingly that sex will follow at some point, and it won't define you then. Why let it define you now, you know?\n\nI'm sorry if this is rambling or unhelpful. I wish I could buy you a burger and a beer and just talk about life with you, dude.

Other than that being interesting and charismatic is something that you develop through interactions with other people good or bad and learn on that. Get a hobby, most interesting people in my opinion are the ones who are passionate about something specific + gives you something to talk about.

I prefer anal sex though as it's quicker to orgasm and because I can feel the warmth of the ejaculation.", "id": "d0ttlih"}, {"comment": "That is very fascinating. I've been reading your responses here with quite some interest. Your stories are very unusual and seem fairly pornlike, so it is possible you are a fake, but I'll respond on the assumption that you are not.\n\nI have an impulsive streak too, though not nearly so dangerous as yours. I have found it is rarely productive to fight my impulsiveness head-on. I have limited self-control and I just can't maintain it. \n\nInstead of swimming against the current, I try to use my impulsivity as a tool. That means rearranging my environment or goals so that my impulses are useful to me, instead of destructive. \n\nFor instance, I had a lot of student debt for a while, but it was hard to pay off because I am an impulsive spender. Instead of focusing on resisting the urge to spend money on things, I focused my attention on the thrill of paying back extra debt and watching the balance go down. So when I was feeling impulsive, instead of spending money on whatever, I'd impulsively pay an extra $20 towards my debt, or however much I whimsically wanted, sporadically and irregularly, as often as I felt the urge. Then I'd get a thrill watching the balance go down and would feel excited about it. That became my reward, my fix, if you will. Whenever I was stressed out, I would log into my bank account and pay extra money towards my debt load. Then I would have not very much money in my bank account and wouldn't be able to spend frivolously. (I later did the same thing with saving money by setting up a savings account at a separate bank, where the money was safely out of sight and thus out of mind, and transferring money into it impulsively.)\n\nRight now I am trying to get myself to exercise more, so I am trying to teach myself to have a compulsive need to exercise. It's a way of capitalizing on your own addictive nature and using it for good.\n\nI wonder if you could do the same thing. I think that if you try not to have sex, you will always lose, because you can't fight your obsessive nature. But can you replace that obsession with a different one? For instance, recently I've been getting into orgasm denial and chastity fetish porn. Instead of hating the feeling of sexual frustration and need, can you focus on it so intensely that you get off on it? \n\nI do this for certain kinds of pain: I have a low pain threshold generally, but if I focus on the pain in the right way, focus my entire attention on it and let it wash over me, it turns into this intense all-consuming satisfying feeling that makes me shudder. (I used to use this technique as a coping mechanism back in my angsty teen years, when I would engage in self-harm and then dissolve myself into the pain and let it carry away my feelings of guilt and frustration. Now I use the same technique masochistically, the difference being that instead of focusing on the pain until it absorbs my guilt, I focus on it until it turns into arousal. Same idea, slightly different use.)\n\nLike I said, I've been getting into orgasm denial. And there's something extremely hot about taking the intense, all-consuming need I feel for release \u2014 the tightness in my clit, the tingling in my nipples, the aching in my cunt \u2014 and focusing on it until it feeds back in to my desire and just makes me hornier. It is so intense, so powerful. Letting that desperation and frustration take over my body and revelling in it is amazing and makes me feel high, ecstatic \u2014 a kind of sublime torture. Highly recommended if you haven't tried.\n\nSo what I wonder is whether you can teach yourself to do that too. You'll have all this obsessive desire and need for sexual stimulation, but instead of acting on it, feed it back into itself and get your high from denying yourself. In other words, instead of trying not to have sex, try to get off on torturing yourself with frustration and all-consuming desire. Learn to enjoy the frustration itself and embrace it, instead of fighting it. Because I doubt you can fight against your sexual desire and win; you're never going to not have that urge. You have to embrace it and focus on it and let it be an end in itself, a powerful feeling in its own right, rather than one you try to avoid.\n\nI don't know if that makes any sense. It's kind of hard to explain what I do with these things. What I mean is, instead of trying to deny yourself rewards, make the frustration itself the reward. Then you're not fighting against your desire, but rather channelling it more productively.\n\nYou could also try getting a female chastity belt and having someone (a lover, perhaps) lock you in it every morning and keep the key. Then you can revel in the hot feeling of having someone else control you sexually. I don't know if that's something you get off on, but it's something that drives me crazy. (It's a feedback loop for me: I am super aroused by the idea of not being allowed to come, which then makes me feel more sexually frustrated and makes not coming harder, which then feeds right back in. It's a pretty intense experience.)\n\nThe only other thing I can offer is to become obsessed with something else, something more innocuous. Again, you won't win by fighting against yourself. You might win by consciously obsessing over something else long enough that your obsessive/compulsive tendencies kick in and you have a new compulsion to distract you from the old one. So instead of obsessing over and compulsively having sex, develop a compulsion to exercise \u2014 if it helps, use one of those online motivation sites that tracks your progress graphically so that you can get a reward feeling from seeing tangible short-term results (points!) from progress towards a long-term goal. Or develop a compulsion to clean things. Or develop a compulsion to donate money to charity. Or whatever thing you connect to strongly enough that you can focus your mind on it until you obsess over it.\n\nIn other words, it's almost impossible to fight your obsessive nature. The most feasible solution is to either embrace the obsession and revel in denying yourself as its own reward, or replace this obsession with a more socially productive one. Don't try to fight this powerful current. Just build a watermill so that you can harness the current's power and use it productively.", "id": "d0u20jy"}, {"comment": "Your way to pay off debt sounded like something that would work for me!

Going to the gym is a big production. Never mind that. Find some strength exercises you can do in the midst of your daily life, in the cracks of time between things. Want a coffee break? Do three sets of ten squats while you're up and going. Have running shoes with you so that you can go on an impromptu fifteen-minute run when you get frustrated with whatever you're doing. Do that a few times a day and you're getting great exercise. Or you could walk up and down the stairs in your building ten times, for 15 to 20 minutes, spontaneously.\n\nThen, once you've structured your life so that you can exercise on impulse, get something that will track your exercise time and give you points. I've just started using Beeminder: it's an online application in which you set a goal (for example, doing 30 minutes of cardio exercise every day), and then you enter how much you actually do. If you deviate from your targets for more than a few days, it deducts $5 from your credit card and donates it to charity. If you meet it, though, you get to chart your progress towards your goal on a convenient graph, so you have something tangible that you can feel rewarded by. \n\nBasically, find some way to give yourself imaginary points every time you exercise. Another idea is to get one of those step-counters, and then track your steps every day. Then you'll walk just that little bit longer so that you'll get in another 100 steps. You'll pace while you're thinking. You'll have an immediate reward \u2014 points! \u2014 every time you engage in this behaviour.\n\nSee if any of those things work.

I was either in a adjustable bar chair leaning forward and with my ass outwards or just lying in bed faced down. I lost count of how many penetrated me over many afternoons, though many must have been the same persons. I was so excited I gasped for air whenever I heard the door open.

My first was an older uncle when I was 14. He took care of me for a couple of weeks while my mom went on a business trip abroad. We were watching a movie and I had my head on his lap. A sex scene came on and he became uncomfortable. I said it was ok and that it didn\u2019t bother me at all but as I said this I instinctively went for his crotch with my mouth while looking at him. He didn\u2019t stop me and it was the best moment of my life put to that point. My heart almost exploded and my body was electrified. I only performed oral on him that time but when he ejaculated in my mouth I was hooked on that feeling. The next days were my new world. I was performing oral on him constantly. I kept pushing him into having sex but he feared I\u2019d get pregnant. I suggested anal, which he accepted eventually and it was a new experience and the one that made a lasting impression. That first time was painful and took hours of prepping but by the end, the feeling of fulness and the feeling of warm ejaculate being shot inside me was the closest I felt to being alive. It was also something I never could feel in my vagina. I felt great pleasure but not the same as with anal sex. Weeks later I was taking it with little prep. My uncle is an introvert with Aspergers.

Not true. Yes, you can just lube, but that's not the only thing that needs to happen before she is ready for sex. When women are aroused, the vagina opens/ loosens, allowing penetration to happen more easily. If she is not ready then that can be nervewracking or embarrassing, and some men make women feel bad about needing more foreplay. It is quite possible that there is *more* pressure to perform on the man than the woman, but who cares? It isn't a contest. First time sex can be a bit scary for everyone involved and would be treated as such by all parties."], [111, "> Please separate this question from self consciousness, I am strictly talking about pressure under the situation.\n\nThis is impossible. Most pressure is strictly there _because_ of self-consciousness. If we did not care about our sexual performance, there would be no pressure at all. So, not only do I disagree with your initial premisse, I think your condition at the end scuttles the discussion before it even began.\n\nSome arguments below:\n\nBoth becoming erect and becoming wet / relaxed enough to make PIV possible are, barring hormonal / medical concerns, mostly a matter of not being too self-conscious. It is also not true that lube can work as a way to make an unprepared vagina ready for penetration - tensed muscles can still make PIV painful or outright impossible, no matter how much lube is applied. So, while I agree that a lack of erectness in a person with a penis is more _visible_ than a lack of vaginal preparedness in another person, I don't think one is necessarily worse. Both are needed to have PIV sex that would be considered successful.\n\nAlso, the idea that penile erectness (and PIV) is such a central part of sex, is a form of self-consciousness, albeit one that is built up through our discourse about heterosexual sex. Penetration and PIV or PIA realistically only make up a small portion of what sex is all about. Not \"performing\" in that aspect is of course unfortunate if that is what you want, but it isn't automagically a 'sex death penalty', or even something that makes sex sub-par, unless the people who experiences an issue believes it to be so. \n\nThe same for having an orgasm after a very short period of PIV. While women do not commonly experience this problem, not orgasming, which is more common in women than in men, although men can also have issues there, can feel equally pressuring, and lead to equal levels of worry about how they are perceived by their sex partner. While orgasming early can lead to disappointed responses and maybe pity, a lack of orgasm can also lead to very uncomfortable situations, for instance when a partner decides to 'chase' an orgasm (and in that way ensures that it will never happen), or even take the lack of orgasms seriously.\n\nAgain, the discourse about sex would be much improved if we chose to place less focus on PIV and on orgasms as both the pinnacle of sexual achievement and (often, in the case of the male orgasm) the 'end' of sex. Again, what exists in the sex-haver's mind is paramount. It takes a bit of a conscious decision and a bit of willpower to continue sexual activity after just having had a orgasm, but it can be done and (as far as I am concerned) doing so often leads to better sexual \"performance\" both for men and women.\n\nAs to your points about size. I am unsure if vaginas vary less in size than penises do. What do you base that on? And while kegels do not change penis size, they can be used to control degrees of erectness, and the penile movements that kegels create can give a really fun touch to penises regardless of size. While people often face ridicule for small penises, complaints about wide and loose vaginas are roughly equally common, imho. People with small penises may see their masculinity challenged. People with wide or loose vaginas may be accused of being sexually promiscuous or being 'used up'. In that sense, I think the ridicule towards people with loose vaginas is tied more to their worth and value as a person than the ridicule towards people with small penises.\n\nI do think men face more pressure to be the 'active' sex partner (initiates actual sex, proposes position changes, sets the pace, etc), whereas women are tacitly encouraged to be more passive. For both men and women, stepping outside of this norm, can lead to ridicule, but I do think that passive men see a more serious challenge here, since sexually active women are regularly appreciated in private, even if they are considered 'bad', 'desperate' or 'slutty' in public, whereas it takes a bit of a niche interest to really enjoy (very) passive partners, regardless of gender.   \n\nOn the other hand, I have the impression that it is much easier to get a pass on either not performing or very poorly performing cunnilingus, than it is to get a pass on performing fellatio. \n\nOverall, I'd say the pressures placed on men and women to perform sexually, especially early on, are roughly equal.

Which a female orgasm can be highly difficult to achieve, especially with confidence issues assuming that they are even able to given conventional methods (such as PIV). Add to that males are commonly concerned with just trying to last a descent amount of time, let alone which buttons of their partner's they are hitting to maximize their pleasure. \n\nAnd size concerns works both ways, some women have larger vaginas.

Most pressure is strictly there _because_ of self-consciousness. If we did not care about our sexual performance, there would be no pressure at all. So, not only do I disagree with your initial premisse, I think your condition at the end scuttles the discussion before it even began.\n\nSome arguments below:\n\nBoth becoming erect and becoming wet / relaxed enough to make PIV possible are, barring hormonal / medical concerns, mostly a matter of not being too self-conscious. It is also not true that lube can work as a way to make an unprepared vagina ready for penetration - tensed muscles can still make PIV painful or outright impossible, no matter how much lube is applied. So, while I agree that a lack of erectness in a person with a penis is more _visible_ than a lack of vaginal preparedness in another person, I don't think one is necessarily worse. Both are needed to have PIV sex that would be considered successful.\n\nAlso, the idea that penile erectness (and PIV) is such a central part of sex, is a form of self-consciousness, albeit one that is built up through our discourse about heterosexual sex. Penetration and PIV or PIA realistically only make up a small portion of what sex is all about. Not \"performing\" in that aspect is of course unfortunate if that is what you want, but it isn't automagically a 'sex death penalty', or even something that makes sex sub-par, unless the people who experiences an issue believes it to be so. \n\nThe same for having an orgasm after a very short period of PIV. While women do not commonly experience this problem, not orgasming, which is more common in women than in men, although men can also have issues there, can feel equally pressuring, and lead to equal levels of worry about how they are perceived by their sex partner. While orgasming early can lead to disappointed responses and maybe pity, a lack of orgasm can also lead to very uncomfortable situations, for instance when a partner decides to 'chase' an orgasm (and in that way ensures that it will never happen), or even take the lack of orgasms seriously.\n\nAgain, the discourse about sex would be much improved if we chose to place less focus on PIV and on orgasms as both the pinnacle of sexual achievement and (often, in the case of the male orgasm) the 'end' of sex. Again, what exists in the sex-haver's mind is paramount. It takes a bit of a conscious decision and a bit of willpower to continue sexual activity after just having had a orgasm, but it can be done and (as far as I am concerned) doing so often leads to better sexual \"performance\" both for men and women.\n\nAs to your points about size. I am unsure if vaginas vary less in size than penises do. What do you base that on? And while kegels do not change penis size, they can be used to control degrees of erectness, and the penile movements that kegels create can give a really fun touch to penises regardless of size. While people often face ridicule for small penises, complaints about wide and loose vaginas are roughly equally common, imho. People with small penises may see their masculinity challenged. People with wide or loose vaginas may be accused of being sexually promiscuous or being 'used up'. In that sense, I think the ridicule towards people with loose vaginas is tied more to their worth and value as a person than the ridicule towards people with small penises.\n\nI do think men face more pressure to be the 'active' sex partner (initiates actual sex, proposes position changes, sets the pace, etc), whereas women are tacitly encouraged to be more passive. For both men and women, stepping outside of this norm, can lead to ridicule, but I do think that passive men see a more serious challenge here, since sexually active women are regularly appreciated in private, even if they are considered 'bad', 'desperate' or 'slutty' in public, whereas it takes a bit of a niche interest to really enjoy (very) passive partners, regardless of gender.   \n\nOn the other hand, I have the impression that it is much easier to get a pass on either not performing or very poorly performing cunnilingus, than it is to get a pass on performing fellatio. \n\nOverall, I'd say the pressures placed on men and women to perform sexually, especially early on, are roughly equal.

It's a common position. And if you ask whoever you are with what positions they enjoy, you might find that missionary isn't always enjoyed by everyone. \n\n> Technique must be good to impress while a man is on top.\n\nNo technique must not be good to impress.

Vaginas can accommodate varying sizes, but vaginas do have varying depth (until you hit the cervix).  There was a video (which I can't find at the moment) where one pornstar talked about how some actresses have shallow but wide vaginas and can do things like double-vaginal or very thick guys, whereas some are much deeper and can accommodate longer guys more comfortably.

Add to that males are commonly concerned with just trying to last a descent amount of time, let alone which buttons of their partner's they are hitting to maximize their pleasure. \n\nAnd size concerns works both ways, some women have larger vaginas. And if they prefer deeper penetration, that requires a longer dick. It's not an insult to anyone specifically but that's just how the cards laid out.

Sex? There are so many ways to have sex in which there is no need for an erect penis. How do you think the lesbians do it? Sure, an erect penis is nice. If the penis ejaculates, that can be fun. But people can have orgasms without ejaculating, they can have orgasms without touching their penises and they can even have sex without orgasming at all. \n\nThis is precisely the point I was making earlier: by acting as if penile stimulation until ejaculation is the only type of sex one can have, you're unnecessarily limiting your own expression, and are assuming a ton of pressure that does not need to be there.\n\nMaybe that limited view of sex is why responses in this thread feel like 'attacks', when they're really quite politely disagreeing and providing explanations.

Why ruin a relationship that is 95% perfect to get a couple percentage points that may never show up, or would have other problems that make for a worse relationship (if you can even visualize a relationship like that).\n\n**Basically those people that have a fulfilling awesome sex life / relationship with only one partner in their entire life, have won the relationship jackpot early on.**\n\nAt the same time if you are that dissatisfied in a relationship, you should have every right to end that relationship and look for what makes you happy (obviously relationships are complicated, but this is a generalization).  If that doesn't happen until a dozen partners, why the hell should anyone judge you harshly?

Your girl is super turned on, and she thinks you are doing a great job. Business as usual, then afterward, she wants to get away from you for seemingly no apparent reason.\n\nDoes he know that she thinks he assualted her? No, he thinks the opposite! They have been together 4 months and it sounds like he really cares about her. He deserves to know whats up and now is the perfect opportunity to set boundaries for the future so she doesn't feel uncomfortable again.\n\nIts easy to get caught up in the grey areas of consent and rape this rape that but you are only freaking a girl out by telling her \"she needs to get safe\" when she is in no immediate danger. The poor guy man, I guarantee he will feel terrible over this forever, hes not some criminal. A crime requires mens rea which he clearly does not have, stop demonizing people based off of miscommunication. Its unfortunate she felt uncomfortable but how was he to know any different, people can't read minds. This is a relationship issue the two of them, yes him included, need to talk about. Communucation! Once they talk it out, hug it out and make up everything will get better. Running away from him with no explanation is only postponing this process and festering hard feelings between them.

She feels guilty even writing this post, and for feeling the way she does. Regardless of what love she feels, he wronged her, and she needs some space right now to heal and process things. \n\n\"Safe\" means somewhere she can process her emotions about this completely. I apologize if I didn't make that clear, and I think you are right. (I apologize, OP! If this made you alarmed, I apologize.) She can explain things to him once she is ready. I would agree that once she feels ready, she should talk to him, especially if she wants to continue dating him. I wouldn't consider it morally wrong if she doesn't talk to him about this though. I know the word \"trigger\" is hated on Reddit, but she might associate his face with those earlier experiences she had with non consent, as well as the violation she currently feels. If he does trigger negative emotions in her right now, she is completely justified in not wanting to see him again.\n\nAnyways, like I said, I don't think this guy is evil or any shit like that. This sort of rough play is hot for a lot of people, me included, but it needs to be discussed first in order to avoid situations like this.

I don't know what the law says about the legality of what he's done. I'm not advocating she goes to the police. I never demonized him, please read it again. I said he made a mistake.

But they're still running around free and I doubt anything is going to change that.\n\nI wasn't born rich so I don't know what someone like Trump experienced growing up. But if the extremely wealthy adult men I know are anything to go by then it can't have been good.\n\nAlmost all of the married men I know regularly cheat on the wives and I've been to parties where things happened where I'm reasonably sure some of the women involved were not fully willing participants and some may have been underage or there completely against their will.\n\nContrary to popular believe there's a variety of issues with being extremely wealthy. You start to lose perspective on things and your sense of morality can get very warped. There's been studies on it and the wealthier people get the more amoral they become. I can't disagree with that from my own experience.\n\nWhen you don't need to work anymore you need something to focus on and a lot guys focus on sex and can get pretty twisted. And since they're wealthy enough they can usually settle out of court or just cover up their transgressions whenever necessary.\n\nGoing back to President Clinton and Trump they are friends with a man (Jeffrey Epstein) who used to fly underage girls to his personal island so that he and others could have sex parties. It's notable that there's reports that Clinton has been to that island a few dozen times at least. This guy was convicted and even went to prison but the sentence was kind of a joke. He got 18 months or something like that. And was even allowed to leave prison regularly so he could continue to \"work\".\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he's gone back to doing exactly the same thing and is just more careful about it now.\n\nIs there any public proof that either Trump or Clinton went to that island and had sex with underage girls? No, but, really people... it's not a stretch.\n\nThe temptation to do things you shouldn't is very strong when you know you can get away with it. And when you don't have any bigger drive in your life to focus your attention on the decadence available to you can be sometimes overwhelming.\n\nIn my personal life I have a girlfriend but I'm not sure I could ever get married.

And many people allow things they would slap another stranger for if they find the person attractive enough.\n\nThe differentiator for sexual assault is consent.

I think a lot of it has to do with how well the victim amd perpetrator know each other, how private the assault was, and other people's opinions about the perpetrator and victim.  There is still a lot of victim-blaming and skepticism in sexual assault cases that may prevent victims from coming out regardless of the perpetrators social class and status. \n\nWhile people who are more famous may have more resources to protect their reputations after rape allegations, they are certainly not the only ones to get away with such actions.\n "], [-8, "I think Trump said things..

But if the extremely wealthy adult men I know are anything to go by then it can't have been good.\n\nAlmost all of the married men I know regularly cheat on the wives and I've been to parties where things happened where I'm reasonably sure some of the women involved were not fully willing participants and some may have been underage or there completely against their will.\n\nContrary to popular believe there's a variety of issues with being extremely wealthy. You start to lose perspective on things and your sense of morality can get very warped. There's been studies on it and the wealthier people get the more amoral they become. I can't disagree with that from my own experience.\n\nWhen you don't need to work anymore you need something to focus on and a lot guys focus on sex and can get pretty twisted. And since they're wealthy enough they can usually settle out of court or just cover up their transgressions whenever necessary.\n\nGoing back to President Clinton and Trump they are friends with a man (Jeffrey Epstein) who used to fly underage girls to his personal island so that he and others could have sex parties. It's notable that there's reports that Clinton has been to that island a few dozen times at least. This guy was convicted and even went to prison but the sentence was kind of a joke. He got 18 months or something like that. And was even allowed to leave prison regularly so he could continue to \"work\".\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he's gone back to doing exactly the same thing and is just more careful about it now.\n\nIs there any public proof that either Trump or Clinton went to that island and had sex with underage girls? No, but, really people... it's not a stretch.\n\nThe temptation to do things you shouldn't is very strong when you know you can get away with it. And when you don't have any bigger drive in your life to focus your attention on the decadence available to you can be sometimes overwhelming.\n\nIn my personal life I have a girlfriend but I'm not sure I could ever get married. I've seen too much and I don't trust myself to raise a kid in this kind of world.", "id": "d8lzbqa"}, {"comment": ">As to whether having money lets you get away with anything? Yes, generally it does. I mean you still get found out often enough\n\nThats the funny thing, I think. Most people are really sensitive about their reputations because often times that what earns us respect and access to tools and goods. Even wealthy rapists lose respect but, in a capitalist society, capital moves *everything* so if you've got the capital then people will still put up with your bullshit, they just may keep you at arms length or avoid as much social interaction as possible. Those who lack the same level of wealth are forced to rely on their reputations for access to capital but can just as easily be dismissed or disregarded despite having a strong reputation. \n\nThis is a silly facade. I'm more interested in calling people on their bullshit but I'm also well off so I can afford to confront people and earn the reputation of \"asshole\" without significant consequences. Besides, sometimes I make stronger allies because of it.\n\n>The temptation to do things you shouldn't is very strong when you know you can get away with it. And when you don't have any bigger drive in your life to focus your attention on the decadence available to you can be sometimes overwhelming.\n\nI think this is arguable. Speaking as someone who *could* get away with things, I try to think about who I am, who I want to be, and the consequences of my actions. One of the interesting things about wealth is that you really can become an island and create an archipelago with other wealthy peers. In the process, you learn what loneliness really is and you make a decision to either protect that island or try to open it up to \"tourists\". I think its that loneliness (and the encouragement of \"protecting your assets\") that really leads to the reliance on decadence as a replacement for social interaction and self worth. \n\nThis has moved away from how shitty it is that wealth enables the disregard of our social expectations. I think what it really reveals is that we're part of a society that appreciates consumerism and economics over cooperation and participation.", "id": "d8m42xx"}], [{"comment": "People in extreme positions of wealth/power are aggressive dickheads who abuse their power in search of sexual satisfaction?

You have to decide whether you are just somebody he f**** or his partner. None of the girls in pornography have your place in his life and you should cherish that, but in my opinion you should also not be threatened by it. Now the other side of this coin is is that he shouldn't be lying to you. It's very important to both of you communicate honestly and dishonesty is one of the things that makes you feel more insecure.

But you can end it for any reason you want, you aren't married, you have made no agreement to be with her forever.\n\nWhat exactly is your problem with this?  Do you feel that it is cheating?

She should seek to match up the values by which she judges others with those by which she lives her own life.  And nudes don't have to be based on insecurity, the naked human body is a beautiful thing, and sharing that body with (trusted) people who enjoy looking at it isn't bad.  Though it should be avoided by those under age 18 for legal reasons and because its easy for a young person to make decisions they regret or get taken advantage of by older folks.

It is reasonable for you to be upset about *that*.\n\n> she was attracted to his personality as an asshole.\n\nShe really said that?  If she likes people being an asshole then that's a good reason to break up with her.  If she likes assholishness in others its only a matter of time before she starts being an asshole herself.

But you can end it for any reason you want, you aren't married, you have made no agreement to be with her forever.\n\nWhat exactly is your problem with this?  Do you feel that it is cheating?

Would you be upset if she sent you nudes?\n\n>  She had never sent nudes before and *had called girls who did that kind of thing stupid* and seeking to cure an insecurity.\n\nThis is a hypocritical attitude of hers. She should seek to match up the values by which she judges others with those by which she lives her own life.  And nudes don't have to be based on insecurity, the naked human body is a beautiful thing, and sharing that body with (trusted) people who enjoy looking at it isn't bad.  Though it should be avoided by those under age 18 for legal reasons and because its easy for a young person to make decisions they regret or get taken advantage of by older folks.

It is reasonable for you to be upset about *that*.\n\n> she was attracted to his personality as an asshole.\n\nShe really said that?

I do really believe this. I've talked to several women I've found, through sex-positive groups and events that have taken place on my college campus, several strippers or former strippers from my area. I've talked to them about clubs, about their best and worst experiences, about everything. I have done everything possible to figure out the contact and mileage expected in the clubs I am looking at (for example, are extras a common occurrence? Will the bouncers step in if a customer touches my breasts?). I have spent about a month or so considering the pros and cons of this choice, and whether or not I think it is something I could realistically do. It isn't as if, a day before this conversation, I woke up thinking 'wow, I really wanna be a stripper! Let's bring it up!'

Yes, he can want to protect me from something, but still want to enjoy the services. /u/cheesywipper said something similar. I guess that my problem is that I want a boyfriend, not a father. When I date someone, I'm not looking for them to go all Mufasa on me and tell me to only go where the light touches, and stay out of dangerous strip clubs. I like to think myself capable of making smart, or at least thought out, decisions. When I decided this was something that I wanted to do, I already thought out all the dangers and risks. I don't need him to do that for me, and then decide. In a relationship, I would have liked my partner to say, \"Okay, so you want to do this. You've thought about these things, right? You have? Well, then, I'm with you, no matter what. If something goes wrong, I've got your back.\" What I don't want them to say is, \"This is too dangerous. You shouldn't do it.\"\n\nBut I guess you guys are right. This doesn't really connect to him going to strip clubs at all. Whenever he goes, I'll be sitting at home thinking that he's out there, paying some girl to do what he wouldn't let me do, but it sounds like that's a *me* problem that I have to figure out how to handle separately. But if he thinks it's so dangerous and terrible, why is it an industry he should support?\n\nEDIT: cheesywipper also mentioned that he wants to protect *himself* from the social stigma of me being a stripper, which this doesn't really address. But when we were talking about it, I asked him if he was worried about his own reputation, or just mine, and he claims he doesn't care what people think about *him.* I don't believe that for one second, but if it were the case, I would have liked him to tell me.

It isn't that I don't want him to tell me his concerns. I am trying to discuss those concerns with him, so that he can know I've thought about them and have either looked into ways to minimize the risk, or I have decided that the benefits outweigh a particular risk. I would like him to express why he thinks it's dangerous so we can work together for ways to keep me safe, but I don't want him to keep me from doing it *because* he thinks it' dangerous, even if the dangers are something I feel like I can work with, you know? \n\n> That you are eager to prove your knowing best, impatient of contradiction, and will go to some lengths (and a certain verbal aggression) to push that image through.\n\nThat's a fine assertion for you to make. In my opinion, a lot of this came out (particularly the aggression) because I felt attacked and unheard for a large part of the time, and did not understand what others were trying to say. This was my mistake. If you read another one of my threads in this question, though, once the other poster calms down (and I start asking questions), things deescalate. I think that it is not entirely my fault. I will take some responsibility. I got defensive when I felt people were attacking me (not necessarily the people I responded to, in particular, though there were times some were rude, as well, but there were other posters I didn't respond to because they made suggestions about my ability to refuse cash for face of acts I consider degrading, said rude or disgusting things about my wanting to strip, etc. Last night was a high stress situation for me. I apologize for my role in it and how that played out.\n\n>Human beings are capable of quite some self-deceit, and it is necessary for us to function. I wouldn't want my girlfriend to be a cop - a dangerous and terrible job that wrecks those working itmore often than not! But I still support those who do serve with the Yard, because I profit by their services.\n\nI see what you're saying, but to me, sex work is fundamentally different, especially for a man in a relationship. We require police to maintain a level of safety and justice. We require butchers to eat. Cars are necessary for transportation, and cell phones are necessary for communication. And yes, I think they are *necessary*, at least to people living in America, because if you don't have them, you are at a huge disadvantage to everyone else who does have them. I don't expect anyone to raise and kill their own cows, I don't expect anyone to walk 20+ miles to work, now that suburbs have separated people from cities. They should drive. You don't need a cell phone, I suppose, but things are certainly a lot easier for the people who have them and can connect instantly, without wondering if the person they are trying to reach is home. So, while the people that provide the means for these things work under dangerous conditions, they are producing necessary products.\n\nSex work is entirely different. Do the women work under dangerous conditions? Yes. But does anyone (particularly someone in a relationship) need to buy those services (with an emphasis on need)? No. Maybe you would disagree, and it's fine if you do. I would love to hear your logic around this.

You're understandably reluctant to use the word \"rape\" to describe what happened to you because in your mind what happened wasn't as bad as the kind of rape that gets headlines.\n\nBut you were, at the least, taken advantage of.\n\nAlso, and this will probably be controversial, but things get confusing in a society where a lot of people feel like they have to be sexually aggressive to get a physical relationship going. This is not in any way an apologia for this guy; what he did was wrong, period. But it might help *you* resolve some of your feelings about it if you don't try to categorize everyone that commits rape as a violent attacker.\n\nRape is a really psychologically loaded word that can bring with it a lot of questions about power and victimhood and self identity and, in cases where the victims are male, masculinity.\n\nI'd recommend seeing a professional therapist that can help you address and resolve some of the feelings you have about it, preferably sooner than later, because this could fester and develop into bigger problems for you.\n\nIn the meantime, some straight talk:\n\n- Just because you woke up to getting your dick sucked and it felt good doesn't mean you're any less straight.\n- It doesn't even count as \"gay experimentation\" because you didn't initiate it and you didn't want it.\n- You're not the first person to feel sexual arousal during abuse, as I understand it it's not uncommon.\n- It was rape but calling it that probably won't make you feel better.\n- The guy took advantage of you because he couldn't control himself. It was wrong. Hanging out with him later on doesn't change this.

Being drunk is NEVER an acceptable excuse for any action you take, owe up to it. If you are an angry drunk and regularly get in verbal fights you may need to look at yourself and see what needs to change.

If you try and comfort him in ANY way it will most likely result (unless hes completely whipped and basically wrapped around your finger) in him snapping back at you. My advice (and maybe not the best) is to just let him cool down and approach you with his conclusions to the situation. Granted he may just leave you without a word said, but then again if your relationship has degraded down to the point where you're screaming about how small his dick is... well it may be for the best. If he does actually try to talk to you, explain your side as best able without trying to butter him up with compliments as it'll be 100% patronizing. \n\nTL,DR: Being drunk is not an excuse for being an asshole.

Anything that telegraphs \"something's gonna happen later that you'll really like\" is foreplay.\n\nI think this is actually part of the point: If we broaden \"foreplay\" to include *everything* that prepares for sex, it becomes nearly meaningless. Doing the laundry so your partner doesn't have to stress about it, and thus will enjoy sex more? Foreplay! Complimenting them on how their ass looks in those jeans? Foreplay! At that point, nobody can be sure what anybody means when they use that word...do they mean they were fingering their partner, or do they mean they loaded the dishwasher without being asked?\n\nEven then, though, there's also the problem of those acts being robbed of some of their value by the supposition that they're only being done to earn sex.\n\nIf we avoid the pointlessness problem by making it more specific, it locks a set of sexual acts into a lesser-than role that *clearly* ends up confusing people. It leads to a constant stream of frustrating questions like: \"My partner really likes foreplay but I'm not really into it. What should I do?\", or \"I really get off on just doing foreplay with my partner...am I weird?\" \n\nYou know you've seen those questions! They only exist if there is some arbitrary dividing line in people's minds between kinds of sexual play being the *real* sex, and other kinds being just what you do sometimes in order to get the real stuff.\n\nSo, yeah, sometimes people read too much into words. But in this case we have a genuine problem. Defined as broadly as you suggest, the word is pointless. Defined narrowly enough to be useful, it enforces an arbitrary, unproductive distinction.

A person has an intellectual, mental portion and the \"autonomic nervous system\", the ANS.

It works in emergency situations on a very primeval level.  It has a very fast response time.  The ANS doesn't consult the thinking portion of the brain.  It reacts.\n\nAs far as the dream goes, the ANS reacted like you were raped.  It elevated your blood pressure, your heart rate, and gave you a dose of adrenaline.  That is what it does...the ANS tries to help you survive.  But, the ANS is really stupid...it reacts, and it can't be reasoned with.\n\nYou experienced a rape.    Your intellectual side is saying, \"It was just a dream.\"  But, that doesn't matter to the ANS.  It is saying, \"Holy shit. I'm not going to let anyone do that to me.  Let me just jack up the blood pressure a little and put a little more adrenaline in the system.\" \n\nSo, your mind is telling you one thing, but your body is telling you another.  So, you are confused, and likely physically exhausted.\n\nThe big thing for you is not to let your intellectual side get out of whack.  Acknowledge the dream scared you and that it wasn't real.

It reacts.\n\nAs far as the dream goes, the ANS reacted like you were raped.  It elevated your blood pressure, your heart rate, and gave you a dose of adrenaline.

Your intellectual side is saying, \"It was just a dream.\"  But, that doesn't matter to the ANS.  It is saying, \"Holy shit. I'm not going to let anyone do that to me.

As for the frenulum, what its presence means in practice is that he'll need lube almost as much as you do in order to avoid discomfort - the foreskin will stick if there's too much friction, but the dick inside can keep moving without it... until it pulls back too far. Speaking from experience, it's not a pleasant experience. Use lots of foreplay, or lots of lube.\n2. Depending on what he's done with it, especially if he has/has phimosis (foreskin so tight it doesn't retract all the way/at all), the head can be sensitive to the point of *pain.* Don't play with it without lube, and for the love of god don't apply too much friction.\n3. That said, the head is *really* easy to stimulate, particularly around the corona (the bottom of the head \"bulb\" near the shaft). Back-and-forth stimulation over that area, especially with the aide of the foreskin, can be incredibly pleasurable.\n4. Use the foreskin! While you shoulndn't touch the head without lube, you can work the shaft completely dry thanks to the foreskin being intact - while you can rub over the outside, too, most of the nerves are beneath it and don't actually require your hand to move over the surface.\n5. Sticking your tongue *under* the foreskin while you give head is a unique and incredibly good feeling for some guys.\n6. **Condoms require a bit more care.** As you can expect, the foreskin makes putting condoms on a bit weirder, since you're adding a moving part to the penis, essentially. For best stimulation and fit, the foreskin should be partially retracted past the head, but not pulled down all the way. Hold the foreskin there, then put on the condom - you can release your grip on the skin once you've rolled the thing over enough to keep it secure. When you do so, the condom might look like it's slipping off a bit when the foreskin slides up - that's normal.

Take his dick in my hand, move the foreskin back just a little bit and back up the head, covering him fully. Do that again a few times, pulling back more each time.

Or something like a thigh harness for your boyfriend to wear so you can ride that while giving him a handjob/blowjob.\n\nThat said, your boyfriend needs to talk to you. Explain to him that while you enjoy giving blowjobs it sucks that that's the only sex you two have. Tell him you want to respect his limits but you have to know what they are to do that. It's okay if he doesn't know exactly, and it's okay of they change over time, but you two need to be able to communicate about this both outside of and during sexual situations. And he needs to be willing to meet you halfway for this. If his stance is \"I'm sexually satisfied, so I have no motivation to change anything\" then you will have a problem. If he sees the issue and unfairness of having a one-sided sexual relationship, then great.

If that creates an incompatibility, there's nothing wrong with not wanting to be with that person. It's not shallow to know someone can't meet one of your basic human desires isn't compatible with you. \n\nThen you come back with the sex negativity of you're not a REAL man if you have a preference?

This isn't some mutually exclusive game where one side has to be the bad guy. \n\nPeople shouldn't feel insecure because it's important to recognize no one is attractive to everyone, and you don't need to be attractive to everyone either. I agree it's horrible to make someone feel insecure about that stuff, but I don't think being horrible back is necessary, and I don't think having a preference is inherently making others feel worse.\n\nPeople being incompatible isn't a failure of those people. If a square peg doesn't fit in a round hole, neither the peg nor the hole is wrong or flawed for it. I prefer small breasts, I don't have to say all men who prefer large breasts are shallow and not REAL men for that.
