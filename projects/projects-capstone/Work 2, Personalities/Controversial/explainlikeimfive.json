It was estimated fighting could have lasted through 1947. \n\nThe Japanese military had been mostly defeated on a technical basis - their navy and air forces were decimated - but they still had millions of soldiers and tens of millions of civilians who could be armed with basic weapons. Some casualty estimates were as high as 800,000 dead on the Allied side (mostly American, but about 1/5 from Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) and 10 million Japanese, if large numbers of civilians actively resisted. The US ordered so many Purple Heart medals in anticipation of the invasion, many of the ones they're distributing now are still from that stockpile. \n\nSo the hope was that a demonstration of the power of the new American weapons would be enough to intimidate the Japanese government into surrendering. \n\nThe only other alternative would have been a truce or peace treaty that would have left Japan's government and military leadership in place, which was obviously unacceptable. "], [42, "Estimates for the death toll for an invasion of the Japanese home islands was quite a bit higher the estimated (and real) death toll from both atomic bombs.  Not just for the American side, but for the Japanese side as well. \n\nDropping the bombs actually saved Japanese lives. \n\nedit: also worth noting, since no one else has mentioned it, was the fact that the soviets were entering the pacific war around then. They already had a hold on most of the eastern european countries they had liberated form the Nazi's, and we did not want the soviets gaining ground and taking over a large chunk of pacific asia as well. So we wanted the war over quickly, and as a mostly American/Australian/NZ/British victory, with the soviets taking as little territory as possible. A ground invasion would have been long and protected and allowed time for soviet forces to move in to \"help\" us.  "], [13, "Because we were at war. \n\nWWII is what we call a total war. Both sides reworked their whole society to support the war effort. Resources are rationed, civilian work is focused on making weapons and military supplies, drafts are put into effect so the entire civilian populous is potential replacement troops, etc. During a total war civilian sites and civilians themselves are fully legitimate targets, albeit lower priority targets. \n\nWe were bombing numerous cities in Japan, particularly tokyo with firebombs. Hundreds of planes were dropping thousands of bombs over cities lighting them on fire and killing hundreds of thousands of people. The nuclear bombs each did about the same same damage as a standard bombing run, only it was done by a single plane and single bomb. The threat that carried was that if they equipped all our planes (Japan did not know we only had two bombs ready) with a bomb we could wipe out every city in Japan at once. So that level of threat of totally being wiped off the planed was what convinced Japan to surrender. \n\nThose specific cities were chosen because they were high priority military targets. One had a military headquarters, supply depot, and troop embarkation point. The other was a shipyard, and supply depot. "], [14, "Japan was a very very different country in WW2. \n\nThey had an Emperor that people honestly believed was divine and that they would do anything for. Citizens were fully convinced that american soldiers ate babies, and actually jumped off cliffs to avoid them.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Cliff\n\nThe alternative to a nuclear attack was a ground invasion. Ground troops going into the mainland would have been a nightmare both for the American troops and Japanese citizens feeling they needed to fight back and die, doing it at all costs.\n\nBut even choosing a nuclear attack, most were not fully aware of the scale and long term effects, even those making the call."], [22, "Okay. America was at war with Japan after they attacked America's base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The problem was that the Japanese people were willing to fight until the very end. If the US sent ground troops to attack Japan, they estimated large casualties on both sides. Now, the US had also been developing the Atomic Bomb. The idea was that dropping the bomb to destroy a city would convince the Japanese to surrender because the US would show that they could just end the war by killing all of them. \n\nThe idea was that forcing the Japanese to surrender would save more lives in the long run than an extended battle to conquer their country. That being said, the two atomic bombs that were dropped did kill a lot of people."], [4, "The biggest reason, honestly, was that the bombs didn't have quite the same stigma that they hold today. The people who made it knew it was a game changer, but it was still just at the level of \"a big bomb\", rather than the overwhelming potentially world-ending force it came to be respected as over the cold war. There wasn't a separation between conventional and nuclear war.\n\nThe scientists in charge of the project understood the implications and the horrors of radiation poisoning to an extent, and petitioned not to use the bomb, but to most of the military brass didn't really understand why they should not use the weapon they spent billions of 1945 dollars on.\n\nThe other reason is that there was something of a gap in the perception of the state of the war at the time between the Japanese and the Americans. The Japanese were almost completely beaten. What little remained of their fleet was stuck in docks due to lack of fuel, they'd completely lost control of the air and couldn't do anything to contest US bombing runs, their troops in China and Manchuria were a shambles, etc. They knew they were beaten, and were looking for a way out (trying to get the USSR to mediate a peace), but many in the military were hoping they could somehow get one last big victory to save face and allow them to attach a couple conditions to their terms of surrender.\n\nBut from America's perspective, Japan was not only still dangerous, but the last push was the most dangerous part. Japanese troops had repeatedly shown a tendency to fight to the last man, and either forced civilians to fight or kill themselves if they thought they would lose. Plus kamikaze tactics had a possibility of still being able to inflict heavy damage even with dwindling resources. Add to that the number of potential landing sites in southern Japan were limited, and all were heavily defended. It was predicted that a conventional invasion would be extraordinarily bloody for both sides, and the US wanted to avoid that.\n\nThe bomb was actually plan B in that regards. Plan A was to rope the USSR into breaking their nonaggression pact with Japan and entering the war. The northern front around Manchuria and Hokkaido was very lightly defended, and the Japanese had been counting on the Russians to mediate a negotiated peace treaty similar to how Teddy Roosevelt had done in the Russo-Japanese war. And in truth there's a fair amount of evidence that it was the Soviet entry into the war that was the straw that broke the camel's back. The Japanese leadership recieved word of it the same morning as the Nagasaki bombing. And while the atomic bomb was still both slightly unbelievable and didn't immediately seem worse than the firebombings Japan had already been suffering, the Soviet entry meant that they were wide open to an invasion from the north and had lost their one last hope to avoid an unconditional surrender.\n\nSome people think that the bomb was dropped as a warning to the USSR, and this is a little disingenuous. US/USSR relations didn't fully cool to cold war levels until around 1948 when the USSR suppressed independence movements in eastern Europe and replaced them with their own puppet governments. The only one who wanted to immediately switch the focus to Stalin and keep the war going was Churchill.\n\nHowever, the USSR did enter into strategic thinking in that there was a risk that the more the Soviets helped in the Pacific theater, the more they might later claim as spoils of war. Using nukes was both a way to say that we didn't need the USSR's help, and to try and get Japan to surrender before the USSR could claim too much territory. As is they only got a few islands, and they're still a contentious issue today. If things had gone worse it wouldn't be out of the question that we had a situation similar to Korea in Japan, with it divided into north and south."], [2, "This question is a bit of a difficult one, because it's tempting to sum it up with **because they were at war**. \n\nBut I feel there's more to it then that. Therefore I'll answer the question by rephrasing it:\n\n**why did American develop the atomic bombs? And why would they then use them on Japan?**\n\nBasically prior to the second world war, physicists had discovered what we now know as [Nuclear Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion). How two or more atomic nuclei can come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles, resulting in the release of a large amount of energy, in the form of light and heat. This was a relatively new field of study, but it very quickly caused worry among physicists.\n\nThe fear was that if you were to discover a way to make a batch of fissile material go through nuclear fusion all at once, the resulting release of energy would easily dwarf all known bombs. You wouldn't need strategic bombing then, only a single plane. Or even a sub-orbital rocket, against which there would be no defense.\n\nWhomever would be the first to deploy such a weapon (if it were feasible) would likely win the war.\n\nSo in August 1939, physicists Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd and Eugene Wigner drafted the Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter, which was delivered to President Franklin D.

Hundreds of planes were dropping thousands of bombs over cities lighting them on fire and killing hundreds of thousands of people. The nuclear bombs each did about the same same damage as a standard bombing run, only it was done by a single plane and single bomb. The threat that carried was that if they equipped all our planes (Japan did not know we only had two bombs ready) with a bomb we could wipe out every city in Japan at once. So that level of threat of totally being wiped off the planed was what convinced Japan to surrender. \n\nThose specific cities were chosen because they were high priority military targets.

The idea was that dropping the bomb to destroy a city would convince the Japanese to surrender because the US would show that they could just end the war by killing all of them. \n\nThe idea was that forcing the Japanese to surrender would save more lives in the long run than an extended battle to conquer their country. That being said, the two atomic bombs that were dropped did kill a lot of people.", "id": "d8uo7zj"}], [{"comment": "The biggest reason, honestly, was that the bombs didn't have quite the same stigma that they hold today. The people who made it knew it was a game changer, but it was still just at the level of \"a big bomb\", rather than the overwhelming potentially world-ending force it came to be respected as over the cold war. There wasn't a separation between conventional and nuclear war.\n\nThe scientists in charge of the project understood the implications and the horrors of radiation poisoning to an extent, and petitioned not to use the bomb, but to most of the military brass didn't really understand why they should not use the weapon they spent billions of 1945 dollars on.\n\nThe other reason is that there was something of a gap in the perception of the state of the war at the time between the Japanese and the Americans. The Japanese were almost completely beaten. What little remained of their fleet was stuck in docks due to lack of fuel, they'd completely lost control of the air and couldn't do anything to contest US bombing runs, their troops in China and Manchuria were a shambles, etc. They knew they were beaten, and were looking for a way out (trying to get the USSR to mediate a peace), but many in the military were hoping they could somehow get one last big victory to save face and allow them to attach a couple conditions to their terms of surrender.\n\nBut from America's perspective, Japan was not only still dangerous, but the last push was the most dangerous part. Japanese troops had repeatedly shown a tendency to fight to the last man, and either forced civilians to fight or kill themselves if they thought they would lose. Plus kamikaze tactics had a possibility of still being able to inflict heavy damage even with dwindling resources. Add to that the number of potential landing sites in southern Japan were limited, and all were heavily defended. It was predicted that a conventional invasion would be extraordinarily bloody for both sides, and the US wanted to avoid that.\n\nThe bomb was actually plan B in that regards. Plan A was to rope the USSR into breaking their nonaggression pact with Japan and entering the war. The northern front around Manchuria and Hokkaido was very lightly defended, and the Japanese had been counting on the Russians to mediate a negotiated peace treaty similar to how Teddy Roosevelt had done in the Russo-Japanese war. And in truth there's a fair amount of evidence that it was the Soviet entry into the war that was the straw that broke the camel's back. The Japanese leadership recieved word of it the same morning as the Nagasaki bombing. And while the atomic bomb was still both slightly unbelievable and didn't immediately seem worse than the firebombings Japan had already been suffering, the Soviet entry meant that they were wide open to an invasion from the north and had lost their one last hope to avoid an unconditional surrender.\n\nSome people think that the bomb was dropped as a warning to the USSR, and this is a little disingenuous. US/USSR relations didn't fully cool to cold war levels until around 1948 when the USSR suppressed independence movements in eastern Europe and replaced them with their own puppet governments. The only one who wanted to immediately switch the focus to Stalin and keep the war going was Churchill.\n\nHowever, the USSR did enter into strategic thinking in that there was a risk that the more the Soviets helped in the Pacific theater, the more they might later claim as spoils of war. Using nukes was both a way to say that we didn't need the USSR's help, and to try and get Japan to surrender before the USSR could claim too much territory. As is they only got a few islands, and they're still a contentious issue today. If things had gone worse it wouldn't be out of the question that we had a situation similar to Korea in Japan, with it divided into north and south.", "id": "d8v4667"}], [{"comment": "This question is a bit of a difficult one, because it's tempting to sum it up with **because they were at war**. \n\nBut I feel there's more to it then that. Therefore I'll answer the question by rephrasing it:\n\n**why did American develop the atomic bombs? And why would they then use them on Japan?**\n\nBasically prior to the second world war, physicists had discovered what we now know as [Nuclear Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion). How two or more atomic nuclei can come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles, resulting in the release of a large amount of energy, in the form of light and heat. This was a relatively new field of study, but it very quickly caused worry among physicists.\n\nThe fear was that if you were to discover a way to make a batch of fissile material go through nuclear fusion all at once, the resulting release of energy would easily dwarf all known bombs. You wouldn't need strategic bombing then, only a single plane. Or even a sub-orbital rocket, against which there would be no defense.\n\nWhomever would be the first to deploy such a weapon (if it were feasible) would likely win the war.\n\nSo in August 1939, physicists Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd and Eugene Wigner drafted the Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter, which was delivered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, urging him to spearhead research into this new type of bomb out of fear that another power would do it first.

The \"40%\" tax bracket (which is technically 39.6%) is for those making over $415,050.\n\n2) Not all your money is going to be taxed at that 33%. Only all the money above $190,150 is going to be taxed at 33%. The first $9,275 you make is going to be taxed at 10%. The money you make between $9,275 and $37,650 is going to be taxed at 15%. Everything between $37,650 and $91,150 will be taxed at 25%. Finally, everything between $91,150 and $190,150 will be taxed at 28%. In effect, the government is not going to be taking 33% of your income, they would be taking some percentage less (don't blame me that I don't want to try and calculate what percentage of your income you would actually be parting with, I would guess 27% or so).\n\n3) The point of income taxes is that rich people are able to pay more of their income then poor people while still living comfortable. Let's say that, after tax returns and deductions, your $400,000 income becomes $310,000, or about $850 a day. You could still easily manage living very comfortable off of your reduced income. However, if someone is only making $40,000 a year and had to pay the same effective amount of income taxes as a rich person, they would have to survive a year with only $31,000. That's $85 a day.\n\n4) The sixteenth amendment of the US constitution (ratified in 1913) states, \"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on *incomes*, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\" So, yes, it's constitutional and legal.\n\n5) The US spends 3.7 TRILLION dollars each year. [Here is a basic pie chart that shows where the majority of it goes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#/media/File:U.S._Federal_Spending.png). Even after they collect all the taxes, it's still not enough to cover the entire US budget, the shortfall is borrowed by people/businesses/other nations buying up things like US treasury bonds, a form of debt that government owes to the people who hold the bonds.

This will be substantially less than 33% of $400,000.

Because $1 means different things to different people. For the person making $20,000 a year, every dollar I take from them has a bigger impact on their actual day to day lifestyle than it would have on someone making $200,000 a year.

Essentially the file is still whole, intact, and even known to the operating system so it can be un-deleted soon after (because nothing has happened except changing a flag in the info).\n\nWhen you actually delete a file on your computer (e.g. when you actually delete not send to recycling bin, or after your computer deletes it from the recycling bin) exactly what /u/Owlstorm described happens.\n\nTo expand a bit, for our concerns there are a couple different levels of \"forensic tools\" that he describes:\n\n- Simple software based - These tools are ones you can get yourself, and they scan sectors of the hard drive that are marked as \"empty\" for data that was marked as deleted and able to be used, but not actually ever overwritten. This is useful for recovering data if you do a full delete of a file but made a mistake and need to immediately recover it (so you know the file hasn't been overwritten yet) or if the header info on your hard drive gets corrupted (basically the table of contents which indicates which files are where on the hard drive). However, **these tools are incapable of salvaging data once it has been overwritten.**\n\n- Complicated hardware based - These tools are ones where you need to dismantle the drive and do a deep scan of the physical media to try and recover data that has been overwritten. These are very large, expensive, take an extremely long time to recover data, and are unreliable at best - the data they recover is frequently fragmented or partially corrupt and unrecoverable.\n\nIn ELI5 terms, the hard drive is a metal plate where data can be written in small buckets. The buckets can't be right next to each other or they would blur together, so there is a bit of separation between buckets. Hard drive manufacturers balance between total storage space, reliability, and cost of the whole drive, so their limit of how close the buckets can be spaced is limited by more than just storage.\n\nThe complicated hardware based tools are much more sensitive and have a better resolution than the hard drive itself, so it can try to look at the space in between the buckets. As data is stored in the bucket, some of it's contents leak out into the surrounding area. Even if you change the contents of the bucket, you might be able to figure out what used to be there by looking at what the leaked contents from before are.\n\nThese complicated hardware based tools are only ever used when getting data back from a hard drive is absolutely critical and the people looking for the data have very deep pockets and lots of time (e.g. the government in cases of national security).

In the sun, and increasing as you get closer to the center, the matter is packed in quite densely, meaning the atoms are all squished very close together with not much space between them. What this means for our poor photon is that he is constantly running into atoms - not because he's rude, but because there's just not avoiding them!

Yes, he's chugging along at the speed of light, but all that mass in the sun produces quite the gravity well, or curved space-time. Because of that, our photon can't be thought of as moving in a straight line along a single axis. He's actually moving on a curved line along 2 axis, but in a way that's hard for us to logically perceive. \n\nAnother way to think of this is to take a circle and quarter it. Take out one of those quarters and look at it; you've got two straight lines (the radii) and one curved line (that section of the circle's circumference). Our photon trying to escape the sun's gravity is moving along the curved line, but we can only perceive it as moving along one of the straight lines. If you were to take the curved line that it's moving on and straighten it out, you would see it's longer than the straight lines - our speed-of-light photon has farther to travel than we perceive. That gap in perception is what leads us to ask, \"It took X amount of time to go from point A to point B, when should have taken Y amount of time at the speed of light; why is it slower?\"", "id": "czont96"}], [{"comment": "Warmth is a byproduct of the light interacting with matter here on earth.

Now, there is more distance from the selection of 'African american' in the 70s, and people are more comfortable identifying as 'black' as a straightforward description of skin tone, rather than any deeper invocation of a past.  \n\nAlso relevant: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kga2soqvMF0", "id": "cy3sqxt"}], [{"comment": "What do you call a caucasian born and raised in Africa who immigrated to America?", "id": "cy3m806"}], [{"comment": "Because as much as people may wish it weren't so, there is such a thing as race and ethnicity, and that means some terminology is necessary in our langue to describe the particular races/ethnicities, and the polite/formal term used in the US to describe black people is \"African Americans\".

I am leaving it as readable due to the number of replies."], [33, "As a Christian, I'll answer for Christians only, but I imagine similar reasoning is at play for other religions.\nChristians believe that the Bible is the true word of God; that everything it contains was written by people whom God used to convey his words. Christians believe that this makes what is taught in the Bible extremely important.\nChristians also believe that the Bible is a \"meta-narrative\", which means it is piece of work that is true in all time periods and for all people. This is why Christians can't (not won't, but truly can't) say that homosexuality, per your example, or any sin, is acceptable: because the Bible, the source of absolute Truth that is meant for all people throughout history, says that they cannot accept it.\n\nAs a Christian, I feel it is important to explain why Christians care so much about what other people are doing, rather than \"living and letting live\". Jesus told his disciples to travel out after his death and resurrection, and to teach the Gospel (the story and teachings of Jesus Christ) to all people. Sometimes, what people (both Christians and non-Christians) focus on is the list of \"don'ts\", instead of the true message of Jesus: that Jesus is God, that he lived a sinless life, and died so that anyone who believes in him can be restored to the perfect creation they were meant to be, and can live forever in the presence of God.\nSo the answer, when you dig down, is because Christians love the world. We want everyone to experience the true happiness and satisfaction that can only be found in having a relationship with Jesus. Those Christians who act hatefully are wrong; it's certainly not my place to say who is or isn't a Christian, and we all fail to live up to God's perfection, but not everyone who claims to be a Christian, is one.\n\"Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.\" 1 John 4:8"], [25, "Because nobody starts a religion with the intention of constantly changing its positions based on what's popular at the time.

Christianity for example, had tons of manuscripts and books. Then in the year 382, there was the council of Rome, where it was decided what to accept and what not from centuries of writing (the gospels aren't eyewitness accounts for example, they were written by followers of the apostles dozens of years after Jesus died), so forming the new testament and the bible.\n\nPeople of faith then treat these books and scripture (of any religion) and consider it the word of their god, as holy. People are not supposed to question this, and so they keep the centuries old morality and apply it today.\n\nThe following is more speculation on my part, but I think morality back then was strongly based on the contributions people had to society. Homosexuals would not have sex with women, therefor not fulfilling their \"duty\" to father children for example.\n\nOur morality (mostly Western morality) has grown to accept people outside the norm, religion (mostly organized religion) hasn't grown alongside it. It's mostly stuck in the past.\n\nNow I have to make myself clear, I'm talking about the overall ideologies here, not the individuals that compose the ideology. There are plenty of religious people that did grow with the time, that do accept LGBT rights and so on."], [2, "My answer is simply that the beliefs of some religions, or at least some subsets of them, do not agree with the social conventions of our time.  Just because something is socially accepted does not mean it is socially acceptable to every individual or institution, only to the majority of that society.  In the first half of the Nineteenth Century, slavery was socially acceptable, but not to all.\n"], [2, "Religions that spread through word of mouth changed too quickly to successfully pass down helpful rules for society. Once religions adapted the idea of a holy book, they became more resistant to change, which helped them thrive for a long time. Society is currently experiencing a lot of change at once, and this resistance to change that was once an asset is now a flaw."], [1, "Short answer: because they're not \"socially accepted\" to everyone.\n\nWhether Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Atheist, or whatever, our beliefs, including our religious ones, are seen through the lens of our societies and prejudices.  When we're brought up to fear and dislike \"weird\" people, that's going to be our gut-reaction, regardless of what our high-minded beliefs say.  That \"weirdness\" might be people who look different, who sound different, who have different beliefs or religions, or who engage in other behaviors that we choose not to or were taught not to engage in (like homosexual sex).\n\nIn ancient societies, this served a practical purpose: a society that didn't assert its distinctions would be conquered and/or absorbed.  In modern, inclusive societies, however, we are told to make an effort to suppress that initial reaction of fear and disgust.  This might be because we've been taught that we should Love Our Neighbor, or perhaps simply because we think it makes life better for everyone... either way, there's pressure from modern societies to accept people despite some strangeness.  \n\nSome have been brought up with minimal prejudices; for them, this isn't hard.  For others, though, it ends up being nearly impossible.  Those are the people who embrace the differences between us... the racists, the classists, the homophobes, the zealots, the bigots of every color and stripe.  They embrace their differences, and embrace beliefs (religious and otherwise) that reinforce their impression of themselves as better, rightly privileged, or morally justified.  They band together into groups who share compatible beliefs, raise further generations in their beliefs and hatreds, and do whatever they can to shore up their walls against the modern world as it slowly, gradually wears them down.  When they feel their walls crumbling, they lash out in fear of losing what makes them feel better than the people they hate, whether this is in the form of beatings, hate speech, shootings, terrorism, or prejudicial laws.\n\nNothing about this is specific to any creed in particular... here in America we often see hatred as shrouded in the various colors of Christianity or Islam, but it's not ultimately about religion.  It's about people being the spiteful, bigoted, terrified, imperfect, desperately fragile things that they are, and embracing creeds that suit their own failings as people."], [1, "This is not an ELI5 answer because I'm not sure how to do that in this instance. Your question is about the source of morality.  What makes some thing morally right or wrong?  Monotheistic religions put God as the source of right and wrong.  What He says goes (and followers believe that what he says is best and for the benefit of those who follow what he says.)  So, anything that is now acceptable but isn't in the eyes of God raises the question of what makes something right or wrong.  /r/reasonablefaith has a lot to say about this and many other tough subjects."], [1, "/u/barbecuemarinara gave a really great response. I'd just like to add that the Bible exists to teach the laws and doctrines of God, one of those being that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever more. Therefore, things that would be contrary to his plan for mankind (i.e. homosexuality, which does not follow nature's intended path of a man and woman multiplying) will never be up to man to decide. We have the free will to do as we please; God can't force us to do anything.

Christians believe that this makes what is taught in the Bible extremely important.\nChristians also believe that the Bible is a \"meta-narrative\", which means it is piece of work that is true in all time periods and for all people. This is why Christians can't (not won't, but truly can't) say that homosexuality, per your example, or any sin, is acceptable: because the Bible, the source of absolute Truth that is meant for all people throughout history, says that they cannot accept it.\n\nAs a Christian, I feel it is important to explain why Christians care so much about what other people are doing, rather than \"living and letting live\". Jesus told his disciples to travel out after his death and resurrection, and to teach the Gospel (the story and teachings of Jesus Christ) to all people. Sometimes, what people (both Christians and non-Christians) focus on is the list of \"don'ts\", instead of the true message of Jesus: that Jesus is God, that he lived a sinless life, and died so that anyone who believes in him can be restored to the perfect creation they were meant to be, and can live forever in the presence of God.\nSo the answer, when you dig down, is because Christians love the world. We want everyone to experience the true happiness and satisfaction that can only be found in having a relationship with Jesus. Those Christians who act hatefully are wrong; it's certainly not my place to say who is or isn't a Christian, and we all fail to live up to God's perfection, but not everyone who claims to be a Christian, is one.\n\"Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.\" 1 John 4:8", "id": "d5oni3b"}, {"comment": "But that doesn't explain why many Christians hate LGBT, even though they were taught not to hate", "id": "d5oo6o7"}, {"comment": "I think /u/Barbecuemarinara is touching on a pretty profound point. Even though there are sects of Christianity that consider the bible to be an infallible source of truth, it still boils down to *people* making decisions on how to act virtuously according to the message contained in the bible. \n\nHistorically, there have been many strong debates on which interpretation of the bible is [the *true* interpretation](http://i.imgur.com/Q9zUIcZ.gif). Some differences are rather benign, such as: \"when is the right time to have a child baptized\", or [\"how literal is 'the body of blood of Christ' during communion\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist#Ritual_and_liturgy). However, a dedication to some biblical interpretations can have real-world consequences (such as stances on LGTB rights, abortion, creationism/evolution being taught in public schools, ect.)\n\nI may be looking at /u/Barbecuemarinara's topic from a different angle, but I agree with him that the central principle outlined within the gospel is that Jesus wants us to be more charitable and compassionate towards our fellow humans. Jesus is what's considered a moral exemplar in [virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics#History_of_virtue). Christians look to his actions and words as a template of how conduct their own lives in an ethical manner. \n\nJesus's teachings are very humanist. I think this idea sometimes gets lost sometimes when people want to draw lines, and look to the bible to find justifications for excluding certain groups from being a part of their church (eg. gays/lesbians/trans). A critic of religion will look at this as evidence that the religion itself is broken. But another way of looking at it is that the religion itself is fine, but it's the *members* that have created [a strong policy on the subject based on a vaguely defined truth that's contained in the holy text.](http://www.upworthy.com/there-are-6-scriptures-about-homosexuality-in-the-bible-heres-what-they-really-say) \n\nThe problem is human fallibility, and the problem becomes compounded like-minded individuals get together and start making decisions as a mob, not as rational individuals.

That \"weirdness\" might be people who look different, who sound different, who have different beliefs or religions, or who engage in other behaviors that we choose not to or were taught not to engage in (like homosexual sex).\n\nIn ancient societies, this served a practical purpose: a society that didn't assert its distinctions would be conquered and/or absorbed.  In modern, inclusive societies, however, we are told to make an effort to suppress that initial reaction of fear and disgust.  This might be because we've been taught that we should Love Our Neighbor, or perhaps simply because we think it makes life better for everyone... either way, there's pressure from modern societies to accept people despite some strangeness.  \n\nSome have been brought up with minimal prejudices; for them, this isn't hard.  For others, though, it ends up being nearly impossible.  Those are the people who embrace the differences between us... the racists, the classists, the homophobes, the zealots, the bigots of every color and stripe.  They embrace their differences, and embrace beliefs (religious and otherwise) that reinforce their impression of themselves as better, rightly privileged, or morally justified.  They band together into groups who share compatible beliefs, raise further generations in their beliefs and hatreds, and do whatever they can to shore up their walls against the modern world as it slowly, gradually wears them down.  When they feel their walls crumbling, they lash out in fear of losing what makes them feel better than the people they hate, whether this is in the form of beatings, hate speech, shootings, terrorism, or prejudicial laws.\n\nNothing about this is specific to any creed in particular... here in America we often see hatred as shrouded in the various colors of Christianity or Islam, but it's not ultimately about religion.

A poor person can't wait for a sale, or even bargain-hunt, because they need those shoes to go to work tomorrow.  The soles just fell off the old pair, and they don't have another.\n\n* Cheap junk:  Can't afford nice stuff?  Buy cheap garbage or used stuff that breaks down a lot.\n\n* No buffers.   Everything is on a thin-to-no margin, so you cannot recover when things go wrong.  Got a lead on a better job?  Better not take it unless it's 100% guaranteed, because you can't go back to your old one if  you try, and you have no savings to job-search or move to a better area.\n\nExample of why this is so much worse in the US than elsewhere: Transportation.  Public transit is terrible almost everywhere, as the US assumes everybody has a car.  The poor end up buying cheap, unreliable cars.  When they break down, they have no buffer and so MUST get it fixed or replaced as fast as possible to get to work tomorrow.\n\nHealthcare is also an issue, as the US medical system only workes well for folks with good insurance.

A man (or woman, but switch the terms around) who has sex with a pre-op or non-op trans woman is NOT gay (straight). Queer, maybe. But a run of the mill gay man is as interested in a trans woman as a cat is interested in vegetables. If you consider straight men and gay women, they're going to see an attractive trans woman and want to fuck her. Now, once they find out about the penis they may (or may not) back off, but that's because of one of two reasons (or both):  \nHangups//societal pressure  \nThey don't like penises  \nNow there's nothing wrong if they have hangups or don't like penises - but it's really nonsensical to think a man who likes a trans woman is gay and a woman who likes a trans woman is straight. Sexuality is way more complicated that what you're saying. For instance I'm trans myself. I'd fuck a cis woman or a trans woman, a man though? I'd pass, 100 times out of 100, whether he's cis or trans.

More of a joke) or they're extremists even within the trans community.\n\n> where straight men and lesbian women will be called bigots and hatemongers if they balk at sucking a dick.\n\nBullcrap. The vast majority of the trans community does not think this. In fact, I'm going to be honest here and I've been on several trans message boards (even ones that are private, for trans people only. you get banned if you invite a non-trans person on or even let them look at the site) and I've never once heard a trans woman say that not getting blown by a straight dude or lesbian is hate mongering.

The only case I can think that closely resembles what you said at all is when Thomas Beatty (sp) the trans man who was pregnant gave birth. No one called people hatemongers over it, some people said he was a woman, then trans and allies responded and said no he's a trans man.

This sharing charge means that metals can be used to move charges across a distance (so long as the metal is in one piece charges can go in one end and come out the other very quickly), and humans can build devices that take advantage of these moving charges.  \n\nOne of the more important devices is built off the principle that any moving charge creates a magnetic field, so if you have a moving charge near another magnet you will attract or repel the charge and the magnet.  This means if you put the charge on a path around a magnetic wheel, you will cause the magnetic wheel to turn.  That turning can be made to do work (just like a water fall can turn a mill stone or a horse can pull a wagon's wheels).  These motors power tools, appliances, etc.  Working backwards (forcing a magnet to turn near metal shapes, will create moving charges in the metal that we can use in other locations).  \n\nThe same magnets and charge principle is how microphones and speakers convert sound to electricity. \n\nWe can also use the heat from the charges movement to create light or heaters.  \n\nThere are many, many other tricks we can do with these moving charges, to accomplish an enormous number of tasks.

Maybe you have them fall onto a drum and make a sound, or fall into a marble wheel to turn it. Maybe you just use heat caused by the marbles moving through the pipe to keep you warm.

I would like to highlight the economic reasons. I really recommend watching Reich's documentary \"Inequality for all\" (on Netflix) and the OECD's many reports on the topic for further reading.\n\nThe key reason income inequality is bad for the economy is because it reduces the money in circulation. Ca. 70% of the US economy is consumer driven. That entails that if consumer spending declines the GDP declines.\n\nThe poor spend the highest proportion of their income, the middle class a high proportion too, but the wealthy spend 40% less of their income on consumer products than the middle class does. So, the more of the nations income that is distributed to the wealthy, the less there is being spent on consumer products, and the GDP declines.\n\nLonger term the effect on the economy is greater. There is, f.ex. a strong correlation between income inequality and decline in schooling. The more income inequality there is, the less is spent on education, particularly the poor. It also reduces greatly the number of lower and middle class kids obtaining high quality further education. So the main pool of workers gets less qualified. And there is reduced competition for the highest careers. These factors are documented to reduce the ability of the economy to regenerate (less innovation) and hence the economy will stagnate.\n\nFurthermore, the more income inequality there is, the more the government needs to carry the costs of the poorest. Sometimes this is in the form of welfare, which then will reverse the income inequality. Often, however, the costs are restorative vs preventative so incarceration costs go up, police budgets increase, losses are sustained by disruptions and riots from civil unrest, you have higher homicide rates, violent crimes, etc which all have economic effects. Edit: These are costs that have very limited positive impact on the economy. The government should ideally spend lots of money on items that enhance the economy (education being that with greatest ROI) and minimize outlays that simply burns money (prisons).\n\nIn closing, many now believe that the income inequality was a key reason for the financial crisis in 07/08, just like it was in 1929. When a large part of the wealth is in the hands of a few, a market correction or slight dip will often have more volatile effect than when the wealth is in the hands of the many.

Conversely, had the wealth been in the hands of the common people they would have put the savings in bank accounts, etc because of the risk of unemployment, thereby stabilizing the financial institutions.

You buy a burger and fries at a burger stand for $5. The burger stand owner uses the money from that sale to pay part of his water bill (let's assume he's not from Flint).

Many of the things they had did have in common were however less outgrowth of their respective ideologies but rather a result of them both being undemocratic and not tolerating dissent as well as accumulating as much power as possibly at the top and removing possible competitors.\n\nNazism was all about race and with some great mythology build around the concept how the Aryan race was destined to throw of the shackles of the lesser race and eventually rule.\n\nCommunism had a completely different ideology that was less centered around race and more around the fact that their political ideology was destined to eventually overcome all others.\n\nBoth were willing to bend and twist their ideologies to suit their needs, even to the point of briefly allying with each other despite being on the face of it natural enemies.\n\n", "id": "d44td5b"}], [{"comment": "Despite the similar-sounding names, the ideologies of National Socialism (as practiced by the Nazi Party) and Socialism (as envisaged by Karl Marx) are complete opposites.\n\nMarx described his socialism as using the unity of the working class to bring about an end to capitalism.

In Russia, meanwhile, the original idea of a fully Communist state - no private property at all, etc. - was insufficient and left a void that was filled by Stalin and what became known as \"Stalinism\". \n\nI think the best way to describe the differences in socialism is to say that Germany never went fully Socialist under Hitler. Large companies were still privately held, and some industrialists kept making money throughout WW2. For example, Alfried Krupp (the armaments manufacturer) managed to send a lot of money out of Germany.

Things actually went REALLY well for them for a few decades while they industrialized and upheld a lot of their ideals with funding from their rapid expansion.  WW2 threw things into chaos and by the end of the war they were a ruthless dictatorship that still really believed in communism.  By the late 60's however no one really believed in communism any more.  Communism was simply the ideological justification for the powerful to be powerful and exploit their power.  By the late 80s they were just trying to keep the balls in the air and stop the whole system from collapsing.\n\nBy contrast the Nazis never really had a chance to evolve.  Hitler, through sheer force of will, jumped into direct personal control of the German government and the Nazi party.  As much as you might like to identify Hitler's ideological reasoning it was all rooted in racial theories that were so wrong as to be incomprehensible to us now.  After a few years of Hitler being in charge the country was just being run by a half-insane dictator.  If you had to put your thumb on one thing the Nazi's stood for it was nationalism.

This is one reason wealthy neighborhoods need less police; the residents make each officer more efficient by giving them all the help they can.  If the people that are not criminals are afraid the police will think they are criminals and may wrongly (accidentally) arrest and/or convict them, they will make the assumption that living with crime is better than being locked up or harassed as a criminal.  The law abiding citizens try not to interact with the police which makes the police less effective.  This makes the area more prone to crime which makes the situation worse and reinforces the belief in the officers that people in neighborhoods like that are probably criminals.

What second \"the\"?"], [100, "You read *probabilistically*.\n\nYou don't look at each word, figure it out, then move to the next word.\n\nWhen you read, your eyes make ballistic movements - they don't run smoothly across the page, but rather move in jerks called *saccades* from position to position. You're not looking at a video feed of a page, but rather a bunch of tiny snapshots.\n\nThe top comment right now says \"Your eyes actually take in multiple words at a time\", but that's not really true, at least not in the way people typically assume it is. You can only see with detail a very small area of the page at a time (you aren't consciously aware of this the same way you aren't consciously aware of the fact that most of your visual field can't see color). Your eyes will frequently take in *less* than a word at a time in detail, and you don't necessarily aim saccades onto individual words - you might aim at the edge of a word to get a detailed look at the beginning of one and the end of another for instance. And the less detailed part of your visual field is going to pick up things too - you might not be able to pick out the letters in an adjacent word, but you might be able to make out its length.\n\nUnconsciously, you're trying to minimize the number of saccades it takes to read something. So your brain is trying to guess where to aim the next saccade based on what you've read so far and the different alternatives you're considering for what's next. The goal is to figure out what it says, which means to raise the probability of one of the possible words/phrases/sentences/discourses as much as possible.\n\nIn a lot of cases, you're not going to be aiming at every word, or even aiming so as to put every word into that high-detail area at all. If you can be pretty sure what a word is without looking at it, or without looking at all the letters, you can skip a saccade that you would have spent looking at it.\n\nThe word *the* is very predictable (i.e., not very informative), very common, and very short. In fact, it's the most common word, and since word frequency is Zipf-distributed (google that if you care), that means it's the most common by a *lot*. It's also part of a very restricted syntactic class (think \"part of speech\", *the* is a *determiner*), so there aren't many alternatives and all of them are much less frequent. Which all adds up to *the* being the least informative word in just about all contexts.\n\nSo if you're programming your next saccade and you predict a *the* and maybe you detect an appropriate-length next word with the crappier part of your visual field, you're going to program your next saccade to just skip past it - you can already be pretty damn sure it's a *the* without having to look at it. In a sense, you probably don't actually read most instances of the word *the*.\n\nIt's not just that you don't pay much attention to the second *the* as that you don't pay attention to *the* much in general. It's not very informative. And a second *the* isn't informative either - it's anomalous, but it doesn't create some other confusing meaning, nor does it allow you to better predict what phrase/sentence/discourse you're reading. Given that it's the most common word, that doubling is a common error, and that doubled *the* isn't informative, if you did notice it there at all (which is probably a big if), it makes sense to just ignore it, and it's probably also the case that you have a lot of practice ignoring it.\n\nThere might also be something to how quickly you process *the* - some sort of overlap of neural activation due to the speed that causes two *the*s to be perceptually indistinct even though two *car*s in a row for instance are perceptually salient, but that's considerably more speculative."], [2772, "Edit: For those of you requiring an extra \"the\" in my comment, you'll find it up here: \"the the\"\n\nIn addition to what others have said, the human brain, when reading, doesn't actually see every word, unless you're not fluent in a particular language. Your eyes actually take in multiple words at a time and parse the sentence based on the words you've taken in. This also means that unless a particular particle is deadly important to the sentence, your brain ignores it. It also partially explains why you sometimes go back over a sentence if it doesn't parse correctly. An extra \"the\" doesn't change the meaning of a sentence, so you continue as if you understood.\n\n(Edit: some source for those interested in how reading works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29 and of course this page has a nice, long reading list of sources at the bottom)\n\nMy question would be to those people who read languages such as Chinese or Korean or Japanese: does the same thing happen if you put two of the same particle in a row in a sentence? For example, would a Japanese person reading \"\u82f1\u8a9e \u304c\u304c \u308f\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\" spot the mistake or gloss over it in the same way native English speakers gloss over superfluous incidents of \"the\"?\n\nEdit: it's curious and interesting as hell: about an equal number of native Japanese speakers gloss over the mistake as much as stands out for the others. If anyone has any research on reading and word cognition in non-roman alphabetic languages, I'd love to read it.\n\nEdit2: As others have mentioned, the eye's saccadic movement system also has a lot to do with this.

Basically, your brain sees \"the the\" and assumes there was only one.  \n\nIn nature, identical stimuli in rapid succession are vanishingly rare - if you see two crouching tigers from the same angle and in the same position in a quarter of a second, it's much more likely there was only one tiger and you just blinked; so your brain edits your perceptions with that in mind."], [14, "Language is not a simple pipeline.  Words don't just flow into your brain from the page or from your ears.  In fact your brain constructs large amounts of language from your subconscious knowledge about the rules of grammar.  \n\nFor example, you can take a word such as \"interesting\", remove the t sound and play a cough sound in its place.  When people hear the word in a normal sentence they will hear the word no problem and not be able to pin-point what sound was missing.  \n\nYour brain reconstructing language in this way allows you to understand your friend in a noisy bar.  It also allows you to read much faster than a child who is learning to read.  You don't have to sound out every word, in fact, you can skip over whole words that you know 'ought' to be there because you're following the rules of grammar in your head without thinking about it.\n\nThe word 'the' is never repeated in normal grammar rules, so when you grab a few words from the title with your eyes your brain reconstructs the most sensible sentence: one with only one 'the'.

We're used to 24/30fps video, and our brains fills in gaps between frames. With 60fps, our brain is simultaneously trying to fill in the gaps & perceiving a new, unexpected frame. It throws us off - our brain has constructed a model of the world that it is using to predict what will happen and modify our sensory perception accordingly.

You're not looking at a video feed of a page, but rather a bunch of tiny snapshots.\n\nThe top comment right now says \"Your eyes actually take in multiple words at a time\", but that's not really true, at least not in the way people typically assume it is. You can only see with detail a very small area of the page at a time (you aren't consciously aware of this the same way you aren't consciously aware of the fact that most of your visual field can't see color). Your eyes will frequently take in *less* than a word at a time in detail, and you don't necessarily aim saccades onto individual words - you might aim at the edge of a word to get a detailed look at the beginning of one and the end of another for instance. And the less detailed part of your visual field is going to pick up things too - you might not be able to pick out the letters in an adjacent word, but you might be able to make out its length.\n\nUnconsciously, you're trying to minimize the number of saccades it takes to read something. So your brain is trying to guess where to aim the next saccade based on what you've read so far and the different alternatives you're considering for what's next. The goal is to figure out what it says, which means to raise the probability of one of the possible words/phrases/sentences/discourses as much as possible.\n\nIn a lot of cases, you're not going to be aiming at every word, or even aiming so as to put every word into that high-detail area at all. If you can be pretty sure what a word is without looking at it, or without looking at all the letters, you can skip a saccade that you would have spent looking at it.\n\nThe word *the* is very predictable (i.e., not very informative), very common, and very short. In fact, it's the most common word, and since word frequency is Zipf-distributed (google that if you care), that means it's the most common by a *lot*. It's also part of a very restricted syntactic class (think \"part of speech\", *the* is a *determiner*), so there aren't many alternatives and all of them are much less frequent. Which all adds up to *the* being the least informative word in just about all contexts.\n\nSo if you're programming your next saccade and you predict a *the* and maybe you detect an appropriate-length next word with the crappier part of your visual field, you're going to program your next saccade to just skip past it - you can already be pretty damn sure it's a *the* without having to look at it. In a sense, you probably don't actually read most instances of the word *the*.\n\nIt's not just that you don't pay much attention to the second *the* as that you don't pay attention to *the* much in general. It's not very informative. And a second *the* isn't informative either - it's anomalous, but it doesn't create some other confusing meaning, nor does it allow you to better predict what phrase/sentence/discourse you're reading. Given that it's the most common word, that doubling is a common error, and that doubled *the* isn't informative, if you did notice it there at all (which is probably a big if), it makes sense to just ignore it, and it's probably also the case that you have a lot of practice ignoring it.\n\nThere might also be something to how quickly you process *the* - some sort of overlap of neural activation due to the speed that causes two *the*s to be perceptually indistinct even though two *car*s in a row for instance are perceptually salient, but that's considerably more speculative.", "id": "cyljclh"}], [{"comment": "Edit: For those of you requiring an extra \"the\" in my comment, you'll find it up here: \"the the\"\n\nIn addition to what others have said, the human brain, when reading, doesn't actually see every word, unless you're not fluent in a particular language. Your eyes actually take in multiple words at a time and parse the sentence based on the words you've taken in. This also means that unless a particular particle is deadly important to the sentence, your brain ignores it. It also partially explains why you sometimes go back over a sentence if it doesn't parse correctly. An extra \"the\" doesn't change the meaning of a sentence, so you continue as if you understood.\n\n(Edit: some source for those interested in how reading works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29 and of course this page has a nice, long reading list of sources at the bottom)\n\nMy question would be to those people who read languages such as Chinese or Korean or Japanese: does the same thing happen if you put two of the same particle in a row in a sentence?

As other have stated the receptors in our body that measure respond to a painful stimuli are called *nociceptors*. All vertebrates have nociceptors, so they have the ability to receive painful stimuli. For example, when you touch a hot stove and feel a sharp pain, thats your nociceptors reacting to the stimulus sending a signal to your central nervous system (spine and brain). Vertebrates have exactly the same receptors in their bodies - they can feel that hot stove the same way you feel that hot stove. Now the question becomes, how does your central nervous system (spine and brain) interpret that painful stimuli? \n\nI'll keep it simple and split pain responses up into two categories: psychological or emotional reactions to pain and nociceptive responses  to a painful stimuli. \n\n* **Pain** = an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with potential or actual tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Refers to both the sensory and psychological perception of nociceptive stimuli.\n\n* **Nociception** = neural process of encoding noxious stimuli, pain sensation is not implied. Refers to the physiological detection and processing of painful stimuli. It does not consider the emotional or psychological aspects of the pain response. \n\nNow some researchers argue that *certain invertebrates* like lobsters (but probably not octopi) can only interpret nociception. That is they feel pain, but they are not capable of responding to it in a psychological or emotional way because they argue that lobster's central nervous system lacks the complexity to interpret psychological or emotional pain. What they have is a simple reflexive response to pain. The same way you put your hand on a hot stove and withdraw it without thinking. You feel the pain, but initially your unconscious brain does all the thinking for you and before you understand whats going on your hand is hopefully been removed from the stove. Again, some researchers argue that this is how invertebrates and maybe even some vertebrates (like fish) feel pain - a simple action-reaction system. \n\nNext comes the emotional response to that painful stimuli - a human might cry out to touching that hot stove, you begin to form a painful memory of the event which hopefully prevents you from putting your hand on the stove, you might even develop an aversion to stoves altogether. This is how humans and all other vertebrates interpret pain - there is not only a reflexive component to the nociception, but a psychological and emotional response to the painful event. Without going into too much detail, veterbrates (with *perhaps* the exception of fish) have the same or nearly similar neurological pathways the send pain to the central nervous system, there the brain responds in a very similar manner as it does in humans, and the animal elicits the same or nearly similar behavioural responses to said painful stimuli. That coupled with the emotional or psychological response to pain has clearly demonstrated without a doubt that vertebrates, feel pain. \n\n**Even if - and thats a very big IF - lobsters only respond to pain in a robotic sort of way (action - reaction = painful stimulus - withdrawal), I feel we have the duty to where possible reduce pain when interacting with them.** \n\nAnother example I would like to discuss are Octopuses. Octopuses have very well developed nervous systems that respond negatively to painful stimuli. Other invertebrates, like bugs and spiders have comparatively underdeveloped nervous systems. For example, while they have nociceptors that feel pain they might not have the required central nervous system complexity to interpret that pain on a psychological or emotional level. However, [even the simple invertebrate system is turning out to be more complex than we first thought possible.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_invertebrates) and some invertebrate species do meet the required recommendations for being able to interpret not only physical pain, but perhaps also psychological pain. As a consequence, many animal care committees in charge of approving animal research and testing have begun to include octopuses on their list of species requiring more stringent guidelines. \n\n**Pain Assessment**\n\nFinally, its true that we cannot directly assess pain in animals. We can't simply ask them how much pain they are in, in that sense they are much like baby humans. However, we have developed many indirect objective ways of measuring pain - from physiological measurements like increased heart rate or breathing. However, these physiological measurements can be masked by underlying causes, like chronic stress. So other objective methods of pain assessment have been determined, and pain scales have been developed for different species. A good pain scale should be valid, reliable, and practical to the user. For example, with mice and rats we use [Grimace Scales](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22330867), and for dogs we use the [Glasgow Pain Scale](http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_61908_en.pdf). While there have been no validated pain scales for cats, a similar one to the Glasgow pain scale has been developed (e.g. the Scotland Pain Scale). These pain scales rely on visual or auditory interpretation of the animals behaviour and appearance (e.g. vocalization, withdrawal reflex, social interaction, degree of grooming, ear placement, eye position and shape, body position and shape).\n\nThere are many different ways that we have objectively measured different kinds of pain in animals and their responses to said pain (e.g. von Frey test, paw pressure tests, small injections of Formalin, Capsaicin, Acetic acid). From these tests we are able to evaluate which nociceptors are activated (e.g. pain receptors for changes in temperature, pressure, or toxins) and how the animal responds to the stimuli (e.g. grimace in rats, withdrawl of limb).

"]], [[{"comment": "From my experience, its like d0nus said...some people don't see some animals as capable of feeling pain, they therefore justify certain actions as being painless - like boiling lobster alive.\n\nThat being said [pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain) is a pretty complex thing. As other have stated the receptors in our body that measure respond to a painful stimuli are called *nociceptors*. All vertebrates have nociceptors, so they have the ability to receive painful stimuli. For example, when you touch a hot stove and feel a sharp pain, thats your nociceptors reacting to the stimulus sending a signal to your central nervous system (spine and brain). Vertebrates have exactly the same receptors in their bodies - they can feel that hot stove the same way you feel that hot stove. Now the question becomes, how does your central nervous system (spine and brain) interpret that painful stimuli? \n\nI'll keep it simple and split pain responses up into two categories: psychological or emotional reactions to pain and nociceptive responses  to a painful stimuli. \n\n* **Pain** = an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with potential or actual tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Refers to both the sensory and psychological perception of nociceptive stimuli.\n\n* **Nociception** = neural process of encoding noxious stimuli, pain sensation is not implied. Refers to the physiological detection and processing of painful stimuli. It does not consider the emotional or psychological aspects of the pain response. \n\nNow some researchers argue that *certain invertebrates* like lobsters (but probably not octopi) can only interpret nociception.

If you focus on what your top posts look like, you're deliberately ignoring all the amazing, informative posts that answered someone's question perfectly and just didn't get front-page viral.  All that's going to do is encourage people to care more about their karma than about what they really need to ask or the best way for that one person to understand the answer.  What I like about ELI5 is that no one seems to particularly care about their karma or whether or not it's going to be a top post/comment.\n\nTL;DR: A lot of upvotes does not equal high quality, and no where is that more true than ELI5.

Clarification is incredibly important for a lot of questions.  For instance, if someone asks a question about what DNA is or how evolution works, I'd like to know, at the very least, if they've ever taken a biology class in high school.  Additionally, there are some questions that are based on links, such as asking others to simplify a passage from an article or explain what's going on in a picture.  These questions wouldn't be permitted under the proposed rule.\n\nMaking things even worse, the mods have clarified that everyone would still be subjected to the (otherwise great) rule of having all top-level comments still need to be answers to the question.  That would prevent the OP from posting the relevant information or link.  With that being the case, if a question is particularly tricky, the OP would have to just hope that someone sees their post and asks the right question(s) to them, instead of just posting all of the info right away.\n\nTL;DR: It's not the end of the world, but I suspect that if implemented, this rule could cause at least as many problems as it would solve.

I feel this allows for better answers because certainly users know what OP is asking based on the title, but they also know *why* the question is being asked based on what is written in the text box. \n\nIf you look at the 11th post the OP even responds the comments using the text box and is able to provide some more context/reasoning and feedback based on users response to his initial question. In the 24th post the OP uses the text box to correct some misused terminology that is part of the post's title.\n\nWhile not a necessity, I feel like the text box can help provide some context to the OP's question and allow users to submit a better response.

Above Norway and Sweden, both countries known for their education. We also have been improving over the past several years. I am not saying that improvements cannot be made, and we should always strive to be the best. But the idea that US education is bad is misinformed. "], [3, "I have no expertise regarding the *entire* American system of education, but as a school administrator I can speak to *some* of the reasons, mainly financial, why schools are struggling.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the typical school district budget around here devotes approximately 70-75% of the budget to salaries & benefits. It costs a lot of money to pay all of the teachers, administrators, instructional assistants, psychologists, counselors, aides, clerks, technicians, school resource officers, bus drivers, kitchen staff, substitutes, etc. The rest goes to classroom supplies, facilities, transportation, contracted services, technology, marketing & public relations, and all of the other operations.\n\nSchool funding is not the same in every state. Where I live, about 30% comes from the state and 65% comes from local property taxes, earned income taxes, etc. The rest is federal money, grants, etc. During the recession, property values and earned income here sank and tax revenue fell accordingly.\n\nRegardless of tax revenues, Republican legislators and governors have implemented a variety of cuts. This might give away where I live, but the recently elected Democratic governor is trying to restore education funding and then some...and we still don't have a budget for 15-16...\n\nContinuing on, our state offers a pretty lucrative pension to state employees and public school employees. For a long time the pension system was underfunded, and then the legislature decided that it was time to fix that so the state has legislated huge increases in each school district's pension contributions. This equates to millions of dollars each year, with no end really in sight.\n\nHealth care costs are also skyrocketing. I know that our district's health care program is considered a \"Cadillac plan\" that will be taxed additionally under the ACA. We were all glad to see that the tax was pushed back.\n\nSpecial education costs continue to climb. Think about it - when our system of education was first established, you typically had one school marm and a group of kids. Now, your typical classroom might be a teacher, several instructional assistants, and a variety of reading, math, speech, etc. specialists who pop in and out throughout the day. Since we have to employ all of those additional people, we have a lot of additional salaries and benefits to pay for. It costs a lot of money to provide individualized educational services to children. Also consider that there must be gifted teachers, van drivers who take children to outside placements, etc. The adage \"it takes a village to raise a child\" is a reality in many of our public schools.\n\nI could go on for a while...one-to-one technology programs are expensive, lawsuits are expensive, charter schools and cyber charter schools have to be paid, you name it. Everything I have listed and more are paid for through school district budgets. As some other commenters have shared, you also have to consider the inequitable distribution of funds based on formulas that are decades old. You also have to consider the concentration of poverty in America which seems to be one of the biggest contributing factors to inequity in how education is provided to our country's students.\n\nTake all of the stress that comes from being stretched so thin due to underfunding, add in all of the pressures from the various stakeholders (parents, community members, school boards, employees, lawyers, advocacy groups, unions, etc.) to cater exclusively to their wants and needs, and the constantly shifting focus on standardized testing, and you start to realize that it's damn near impossible to focus on the children and their learning to make sure that it's meeting our high expectations."], [4, "It could be: the buggy whip. \n\nIf we were starting from scratch, would we:\n\n* Build massive structures everyone needs to attend physically OR would we build virtual classrooms? \n\n* Would we hire generalists to teach everything OR specialists in each subject? \n\n* Would we hire full time staff and give them tenure (no need to continue to perform) OR would we hire a wide range of part time teachers (many who may be donating their time from major corporations, universities, etc).\n\n* Would we use text books OR e-learning? \n\n* Would we unionize OR let the private sector compete to participate?\n\nJust sayin'...the system as it IS is a total MESS!!!

"], [1, "Many of the answers on here are debatable, but I believe the main causes are (please note this is from my conversations with my SO who is an American elementary school special education teacher, her co-workers, and teachers from other parts of the country):\n* Teachers pay versus hours worked\n* Teachers union\n* Older generations unwillingness to adopt latest research\n* Increasing class sizes\n* Teachers' inefficiencies\n* Politicians making the rules without considering research/public education in general\nThe average pay for a new American teacher is about $35,000/year, which is very comparatively low and you can't argue salary increases like you can in private industry. All pay raises are decided by the state government as well so it requires a large voting body to hand out raises, which aren't based on performance or results. Teaching is considered a white-collar job, meaning employers can pay on a salary basis and not per hour and it's a profession that requires a four-year bachelors degree, but the union has still dictated how many hours a teacher is required to work based on a contract, which is odd to me. Teachers are required to work during all school hours but they're only required to work for about one hours worth of time outside of school hours, so their salary is based on that time requirement. That's not feasible though since teachers are teaching during the day and they're legally obligated to complete documentation and paperwork, so even though they're not technically paid for working beyond their contract, they're legally obligated to complete the paperwork, which means they start cutting corners; nobody likes working for free. It's a frustrating scenario and puts teachers between a rock and a hard place.\n\nThe teachers union can be frustrating since the entire teaching body is treated as a whole and pay is purely based on tenure, not results. This fosters laziness and ineffectiveness, but without the union, teachers would have no one arguing for them to a large voting body, which is much harder to persuade than a smaller group or single person. This is more of a catch-22 than anything else, but can be improved.\n\nSince older teachers are set for life, they have no incentive to improve and adopt newer research or correct their poor teaching styles that foster poor student behavior and poor academic results. It also creates conflict between newer generation and older generation teachers since they were taught different teaching methods. Older teachers have the voice in the schools though so newer teachers are bullied (for lack of a better word) into using sub-standard practices. \n\nClassroom sizes are also increases dramatically as well and have an adverse affect on younger students. For example, cluttered classrooms can be overwhelming for many small kids and many adults, so couple that with high class sizes and you get chaos because 30 screaming kids are cramped like sardines in a classroom built for 15 and their teacher is a hoarder. I can't learn in that so why would I expect any kid to do that?\n\nTeachers are also notoriously technologically inept, so much of the data they collect on kids is very tedious or non-existent. I've seen some teachers hand-design graphs and calculate all charts by hand; only a few of the newest teachers actually can use technology effectively for themselves to improve their own efficiency (Excel sheets and pivot tables anybody?). As a result, they either spend less time with kids just to complete the paperwork, or they spend less time on paperwork and more time with the kids. The former is bad too because if a kid needs special services they can't get it because the teacher has no data or poor data to backup their claims about the student.\n\nAmerica is trying to implement a public offering when the government is just not designed to make critical decisions at a moments notice on public offerings like this.

", "id": "cypouw4"}], [{"comment": "I have no expertise regarding the *entire* American system of education, but as a school administrator I can speak to *some* of the reasons, mainly financial, why schools are struggling.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the typical school district budget around here devotes approximately 70-75% of the budget to salaries & benefits. It costs a lot of money to pay all of the teachers, administrators, instructional assistants, psychologists, counselors, aides, clerks, technicians, school resource officers, bus drivers, kitchen staff, substitutes, etc. The rest goes to classroom supplies, facilities, transportation, contracted services, technology, marketing & public relations, and all of the other operations.\n\nSchool funding is not the same in every state. Where I live, about 30% comes from the state and 65% comes from local property taxes, earned income taxes, etc. The rest is federal money, grants, etc. During the recession, property values and earned income here sank and tax revenue fell accordingly.\n\nRegardless of tax revenues, Republican legislators and governors have implemented a variety of cuts. This might give away where I live, but the recently elected Democratic governor is trying to restore education funding and then some...and we still don't have a budget for 15-16...\n\nContinuing on, our state offers a pretty lucrative pension to state employees and public school employees. For a long time the pension system was underfunded, and then the legislature decided that it was time to fix that so the state has legislated huge increases in each school district's pension contributions. This equates to millions of dollars each year, with no end really in sight.\n\nHealth care costs are also skyrocketing. I know that our district's health care program is considered a \"Cadillac plan\" that will be taxed additionally under the ACA. We were all glad to see that the tax was pushed back.\n\nSpecial education costs continue to climb. Think about it - when our system of education was first established, you typically had one school marm and a group of kids. Now, your typical classroom might be a teacher, several instructional assistants, and a variety of reading, math, speech, etc. specialists who pop in and out throughout the day. Since we have to employ all of those additional people, we have a lot of additional salaries and benefits to pay for. It costs a lot of money to provide individualized educational services to children. Also consider that there must be gifted teachers, van drivers who take children to outside placements, etc. The adage \"it takes a village to raise a child\" is a reality in many of our public schools.\n\nI could go on for a while...one-to-one technology programs are expensive, lawsuits are expensive, charter schools and cyber charter schools have to be paid, you name it. Everything I have listed and more are paid for through school district budgets. As some other commenters have shared, you also have to consider the inequitable distribution of funds based on formulas that are decades old. You also have to consider the concentration of poverty in America which seems to be one of the biggest contributing factors to inequity in how education is provided to our country's students.\n\nTake all of the stress that comes from being stretched so thin due to underfunding, add in all of the pressures from the various stakeholders (parents, community members, school boards, employees, lawyers, advocacy groups, unions, etc.) to cater exclusively to their wants and needs, and the constantly shifting focus on standardized testing, and you start to realize that it's damn near impossible to focus on the children and their learning to make sure that it's meeting our high expectations.", "id": "cypsu7b"}], [{"comment": "It could be: the buggy whip. \n\nIf we were starting from scratch, would we:\n\n* Build massive structures everyone needs to attend physically OR would we build virtual classrooms? \n\n* Would we hire generalists to teach everything OR specialists in each subject? \n\n* Would we hire full time staff and give them tenure (no need to continue to perform) OR would we hire a wide range of part time teachers (many who may be donating their time from major corporations, universities, etc).\n\n* Would we use text books OR e-learning? \n\n* Would we unionize OR let the private sector compete to participate?\n\nJust sayin'...the system as it IS is a total MESS!!!

If oil and gas prices were to stay low for many more years, Russia will eventually have to cut expenses, e.g. its citizens' pensions or public employees' salaries.\n\nSince it's important for current president Putin for Russia to play a bigger role internationally (militarily) I suspect that Russia's armed forced will not suffer many budget cuts as long as that can be prevented in any way. \n\nTo put it in short: Russia's income (and military budget) comes from selling oil and gas.

For example, Canada has about 1.4 million indigenous peoples, where as Costa Rica has under 150,000.  \n\nEach country has their own history, dealings, and current relationship with their respective populations. Each country also has their own classification system which determines who can and who cannot claim indigenous status. \n\nFor example, in Canada in order for an indigenous person (Also known as *Native American, First Nations, Inuit, M\u00e9tis* and less commonly known as *Eskimo* [a racist term in Canada] or *Aboriginal* [Used more in reference to Australian indigenous people]) to access certain programs or services they must first be approved as being Status Indian. The use of the word Indian is unfortunately a relic from our colonial history, and remains fixed to the original title of the act - *The Indian Act 1867* - which set to govern the indigenous population. I digress, in order to claim Indian Status in Canada a person had to be able to prove their lineage...but it came along with some pretty racist and sexist rules. For example, in [Canada](http://apihtawikosisan.com/2011/12/got-status-indian-status-in-canada-sort-of-explained/) if you were a female indigenous person and you married a non-indigenous person you lost your status (but the reverse did not happen for men), other rather cruel rules included loosing \"Status when they earned a university degree, joined the Army or the priesthood, gained fee simple title of land...One minute you were legally an Indian, and the next you weren\u2019t\". Arguably, these rules were arbitrary, confusing, and meant to keep indigenous peoples of Canada from accessing their rights as a Status Indian. It also had the very real effect of suppressing the growth of the indigenous population - if a Status women bore children to a non-status man her lineage could never reclaim status. Her children, grandchildren and so on were deemed non-indigenous...that was until 1985. The Indian act was amended and some corrections were made...\n\n\"Bill C-31 was passed in 1985 as an amendment to the Indian Act, and was intended to reinstate Status for those who had lost it. In particular the Bill was supposed to reverse sexual discrimination that had cause Indian women who married non-Indians to lose their Status while men who married non-Indian woman not only kept their Status, but also passed Status on to their non-Indian wives.\"\n\nProblem solved right?\n\nUnfortunately no...Its my understanding that the children of Canadian Status Indians could still loose their Status through marriage. If a status one Indian marries a non-status person their children are deemed status two indians. If a status two indian marries a non-status person their children will not be considered Indian. So two generations of marrying outside the Status Indian category and the children are no longer considered eligible for Indian Status in Canada. \n\nSo after another lengthly court battle in 2011 this little loop hole was (finally?) closed....\n\n\"Bill C-3 was given Royal Assent on December 15, 2010 and came into force (became law) on January 31, 2011.  A great many grandchildren of women who regained Status under Bill C-31 (but who passed on only 6(2) Status to their children) can now regain their 6(2) Status if they choose to.\"...\n\nOh and just to make it more confusing...Inuit and M\u00e9tis do not have Status in Canada...\n\n**Edit:** I'm sorry if I got any of that wrong, I did my best as a non-First Nations person.

It is a simple height and weight measurement.  Since it is so simple, there are definitely outliers, but they are just that, outliers.  Most of the population fits into BMI.\n\nAfter starting with BMI, an even better measure is body fat %.  Your lean body mass versus your fat mass.  The outliers such as bodybuilders and athletes might be 6'0\" and 250, a BMI of 34, but they might have something like 10-15% body fat, which is pretty great.  \n\nDoctors, when seeing a patient, are pretty good judges of determining how accurate BMI would be for a patient.

I think the marxist notion that all wage work is a form of \"wage slavery\" or the modern conception of student loan debt doing the same thing are overdrawn, but the idea is that we should be prevented (including by regulation of the state) from acting to abdicate our liberty. Selling oneself into slavery, which has no temporal limit, gives up one's liberty indefinitely.\n\nLong story short, one of the central political philosophies influencing the American Constitution (and legal system) is that we should have the freedom to do whatever we like to ourselves, except when those actions entail giving up your freedom.\n\nAlthough not everyone who tries cocaine or heroin become junkies for life, these drugs have enslaved so many people that efforts have been made by the government to restrict access to them. The government's paternalism is arguably justified by the degree of harm these substances potentially cause.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nCaveat: None of this is to say the government has handled prohibition well, or that choices among different substances have been reasonable or proportional, but for cocaine (especially crack), heroin, and arguably methamphetamine, the reason for the prohibition is that these drugs can potentially enslave its users.

Then the money runs out and you crash and you sleep for two days and you wake up with a nose full of dry blood and an eviction notice on your door. Now heroin. Heroin is a hell of a drug. You NEVER want to come off heroin. You will steal your grandmas dentures to get more heroin. You will suck fifty dicks to get more heroin.

In some cases, we get addicted and do harmful things to get more of the substance or get the money to get more of the substance.\n\nBut why is that illegal?  Well, it sometimes causes us to hurt other people.  Part of the duty of society/government/whatever is to protect its people from harm, so society makes these substances (or using them in certain situations) illegal in the hopes of preventing such harm.   But what if you're only harming yourself?  Where does society get off making that illegal?  Well, you are still part of society, and society thinks it needs to protect you, even from yourself.

I think the marxist notion that all wage work is a form of \"wage slavery\" or the modern conception of student loan debt doing the same thing are overdrawn, but the idea is that we should be prevented (including by regulation of the state) from acting to abdicate our liberty. Selling oneself into slavery, which has no temporal limit, gives up one's liberty indefinitely.\n\nLong story short, one of the central political philosophies influencing the American Constitution (and legal system) is that we should have the freedom to do whatever we like to ourselves, except when those actions entail giving up your freedom.\n\nAlthough not everyone who tries cocaine or heroin become junkies for life, these drugs have enslaved so many people that efforts have been made by the government to restrict access to them. The government's paternalism is arguably justified by the degree of harm these substances potentially cause.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nCaveat: None of this is to say the government has handled prohibition well, or that choices among different substances have been reasonable or proportional, but for cocaine (especially crack), heroin, and arguably methamphetamine, the reason for the prohibition is that these drugs can potentially enslave its users.

Then the money runs out and you crash and you sleep for two days and you wake up with a nose full of dry blood and an eviction notice on your door. Now heroin. Heroin is a hell of a drug. You NEVER want to come off heroin. You will steal your grandmas dentures to get more heroin. You will suck fifty dicks to get more heroin.

In some cases, we get addicted and do harmful things to get more of the substance or get the money to get more of the substance.\n\nBut why is that illegal?  Well, it sometimes causes us to hurt other people.  Part of the duty of society/government/whatever is to protect its people from harm, so society makes these substances (or using them in certain situations) illegal in the hopes of preventing such harm.   But what if you're only harming yourself?  Where does society get off making that illegal?  Well, you are still part of society, and society thinks it needs to protect you, even from yourself.

What a number of people are doing is claiming that climate change (in the form of regional effects of global warming) is not being caused by HUMAN activity. If it's a natural process, we can't be to blame for it.\n\n* Different people have different motivations. Some people honestly do believe that the \"truth\" is humans aren't causing it, either because their own research leads them to this conclusion or because they believe other people's messages and they're just conveying those opinions onward. \n\nSo let's talk about the people who originally create those messages that others might follow, and answer your question. \n\nMany of those people sometimes have very strong interests in disconnecting human activity sources from climate change results. They work for or represent companies that do things like produce lots of greenhouse gas, or produce and sell non-renewal energy sources like coal and gasoline. So their livelihood depends on people not believing that they're causing a potential problem, and they do their best to try and suppress that belief.\n\nOr they're argumentative as a job or as a hobby. A lot of the conspiracy theorists out there don't believe any messages that come from government, and apply less-than-scientific processes to their cherry-picked analysis of what the causes are. They either get their kicks doing it, or get a paycheck from doing it."], [3, "Because fossil fuels are still a cheap and easy way to get work done.\n\nThe usual political and economic policies to 'stop human caused global warming' are to restrict the use of fossil fuels, or to raise the price of fossil fuels (these two things are linked, because economics).\n\nIf fossil fuels become more expensive, it could cripple the economy, but it will especially cripple the poorer economies, the Third World.  Restrict gasoline?  Food prices rise, or the next truck can't being the food to the village.  No diesel to run the generator?  No cell tower - the only source of electronic communication in much of Africa and Asia.  No heating oil?  People die of freezing in their homes.  Coal unavailable, so less electricity?  People die of heatstroke without air conditioning.\n\nTherefore, how much to attempt to control human caused global warming isn't a simple question.  It's a tradeoff of the following concepts:\n\n1.  What are the effects of global warming if we do nothing to control carbon?  \n2.  What are the benefits to our economy if we do nothing to control carbon?  \n3.  What are the changes to the effects of global warming if we control carbon?  \n4.  What are the changes to our economy if we control carbon?  \n\nEven if we assume recent warming, and we assume that warming is human caused, we can't assume that government policies will be enough to stop it.  We might be crippling our economies and causing big problems for nothing.  "], [7, "There's a large point I see missing here, \"What do people have to gain\". This question is more revealing then you think.\n\nLet's start from the point that even your top comment admits, not that many people actually think climate does not change, or hasn't changed. Roman Warming periods and mini ice ages are regularly cited as climate changes.\n\nSo let's take side A. Side A has questions about various aspects of the science and the biases of those involved. Side A is mocked as \"deniers\" in the majority of the media, many express flat out hatred or even call for jailing or \"Nuremburgs\" of these people. Simply questioning *any* aspect of the issue leads to accusations of bribery.\n\nSo Side A is vilified publicly, accused of being bought, flat out threatened and mocked. This is for having any disagreement.\n\nNow side B. Side B agrees with every aspect possible, or may privately disagree about insignificant points. Side B is made to look like a saint, a progressive person looking out for the little person and humanity. They do this not because environmentalist groups help fund their campaigns of course, only oil companies do that, they do this because they are kind human beings. Side B says that if you elect their friends to power, and grant them broader powers and abilities, they can fix everything.\n\nNow think. What exactly does group A stand to gain? Everything is made harder for *asking* the questions, not even having to believe them.\n\nNow what does side B stand to gain?\n\nI figured this was an interesting way to look at this. If anyone has any questions they'd like to ask a conservative climate skeptic, i'm free :)"], [11, "There are whole industries that would need serious regulation if anthropogenic climate change was accepted. Cars, planes, power generation, even some parts of farming (methane limits on livestock, etc)...We'd need to lay down serious carbon caps, put huge taxes on carbon emissions, etc.\n\nBy claiming it's a hoax, an unproven theory, unrelated to humans, etc, they can push back that remediation a little farther and make a little more money."], [2, "There are multiple reasons, most of them intertwined:\n\n1. It's because people who argue for climate change aren't just saying \"it happens\" as an academic issue like \"2+2=4\"...they want others to *give up* something for it. \"Hey climate change...so stop using cheap fossil fuels and use more expensive alternative sources of energy\" or \"Hey climate change...so pay this carbon tax.\"\n\n2. The effects of climate change are difficult to observe to the casual layman. We don't directly feel temperatures increasing year to year (sure, there's instruments, but I mean the typical person doesn't really feel it), when it's fractions of a degree. So you're basically relying on computer models and such which the typical person isn't really going to understand. It's not something that you can just demonstrate as a backyard experiment.\n\n3. People in this thread have speculated on the motivations of people who deny climate change, i.e. \"because they're paid by the oil industry\" or whatever, but don't consider that the *proponents* of climate change seek to improve on their own situations as well (and I don't mean \"we save Earth\", I mean financially). For example, funding for studying climate change depends on the extent to which people can convince the moneyholders in the government that it's a real problem deserving money to study. The proposed solutions to climate change have pretty uniformly been to increase taxes and/or regulations, which politicians like because it increases their power (not to mention the money and power of climate change experts, since politicians need consultants on those tax schemes and regulations). The people setting up carbon markets and such are profiting from it. Basically, there are pretty good reasons why proponents of climate change stand to individually profit from it.\n\n4. There's also debate over the extent to which current climate change is human-driven, versus just natural variations due to the number of sunspots or other factors.\n\nSo basically the proponents of climate change are arguing that people should give them more money and power due to something the typical person can't observe (but the proponents say \"I've got the data, trust me!\"), when the proponents themselves seek to benefit financially from it, at a loss for the people they're aiming to convince. That's the hurdle that climate change proponents basically have to clear.\n\nAs an analogy, say someone goes to your house and says \"You know, your house is in danger of being broken into. You could lose everything or even die!\" You respond with \"Well I haven't noticed any burglaries or robberies in the area lately\", to which the someone responds \"They're there! I have data proving this! You know, I could take care of this problem for you if you let me set up a surveillance system for the low, low cost of $1000 a month...\" People will naturally have some skepticism for this. It doesn't mean climate change is right, it doesn't mean climate change is wrong, it's just that the field is not exactly permeated with altruistic people, so there's going to be some natural skepticism about it."], [2, "This question will result in a lot of opinions so hopefully the mods will be understanding. I will try to refrain from being overly opinionated. \n\nThe Republican side has traditionally represented the Christian/Libertarian side of politics. Denying climate change means doing what God said we could do, inherit the Earth and all that, and ot did not result in something catastrophic. This makes the Christian Republicans feel at ease. The pubs also represent the blue collar man or woman and helps them to feel at ease  with having drilling jobs, driving rigs, working factory jobs, etc. Someone has to help these hard working folks to not feel like they are contributing to a terrible outcome. \n\nThe Libertarian side believes in limited government. What this actually means is that the government should not prevent economic wealth. This is how Fred Koch thought and taught his sons who we know as the Koch brothers. The government should not prevent him from drilling whatever or wherever he wanted to increase economic wealth. \n\nClimate change denial supports an economy and society we spent hundreds of years building. It represents certain beliefs and prevents halting expansion and growth which we must continually do with as many people as this economy supports. It also prevents the opposite side of the political spectrum from using climate change to strip Americans of jobs in favor of full government dependency. \n\nI hope I have offered up a different perspective on climate change denial and have explained what the actual benefit is. \n\nEdit: spelling\n"], [2, "Even believers cause disbelief.  Go into any global warming thread and mention agriculture or expansion of buildings and city and watch them turn on one another.\n\n \"No one wants to go hungry or be homeless so we ignore those issues and focus on something else.\"  Thats what you will see but thats not how this should work. You should worry about all factors. No one is saying to stop eating beef or stop building homes but we need to come up with a better and safer plan just like we do for energy consumption and industrial waste.  \n\nSo why would anyone believe in a cause if the \"true\" believers get to pick and choose what they want to believe?  To ignore evidence.  Sounds the same as climate deniers. "], [3, "The biggest reason is because the measures that would have to be taken if you accept it are not favorable for their interests. Most of these guys are paid off by petrol and fracking companies which contribute to global warming. This translates to the people who are republican, mainly speaking about the leaders, trying to find ways to dismiss it so that they can support their interests. In terms of the many republicans who are not leaders and just average people, they just repeat what they hear. That is why many people have opinions about subjects that they would never ever consider except for the fact that they hear about it being said by people they like and respect so they believe it. "], [2, "I believe it's because climate change is too broad a term. It underpins hundreds of topics with its broadness. Thus being so broad as to be meaningless. \n\nClimate changes regardless of man anyway. So... There is a lot of disingenuousness in the argument itself. \n\nPeople should be more specific when discussing it. Talk about fisheries collapsing or mass extinction. If it's a colder than normal it hardly constitutes full scale climate change. \n\nMeh"], [1, "There are a lot of different reasons, but you can put them into a few categories:\n1. People who would be economically disadvantaged by efforts to figh climate change.  Fighting climate change would mean switching to cleaner energy sources, so it would hurt coal miners, oil drillers, and similar groups, so they don't want to acknowledge it as it would be harmful to them economically\n\n2. People who feel climate change is threatening to their ideaology.  Some people believe that government intervention in the economy is bad under all circumstances, period, end of story.  Due to the difficulty of getting a lot of people too coordinate on problems like climate change, called \"collective action problems,\" many people believe that the best solution is government intervention.  If climate change isn't real, then the government doesn't have to intervene to help fix it, and so people who hate government intervention in the economy may be predisposed to disbelieve climate change because it would be hard to square with their ideology.\n\n3. People who tribalistically oppose it.

What a number of people are doing is claiming that climate change (in the form of regional effects of global warming) is not being caused by HUMAN activity. If it's a natural process, we can't be to blame for it.\n\n* Different people have different motivations. Some people honestly do believe that the \"truth\" is humans aren't causing it, either because their own research leads them to this conclusion or because they believe other people's messages and they're just conveying those opinions onward. \n\nSo let's talk about the people who originally create those messages that others might follow, and answer your question. \n\nMany of those people sometimes have very strong interests in disconnecting human activity sources from climate change results. They work for or represent companies that do things like produce lots of greenhouse gas, or produce and sell non-renewal energy sources like coal and gasoline. So their livelihood depends on people not believing that they're causing a potential problem, and they do their best to try and suppress that belief.\n\nOr they're argumentative as a job or as a hobby. A lot of the conspiracy theorists out there don't believe any messages that come from government, and apply less-than-scientific processes to their cherry-picked analysis of what the causes are. They either get their kicks doing it, or get a paycheck from doing it.", "id": "d38rp5j"}], [{"comment": "Because fossil fuels are still a cheap and easy way to get work done.\n\nThe usual political and economic policies to 'stop human caused global warming' are to restrict the use of fossil fuels, or to raise the price of fossil fuels (these two things are linked, because economics).\n\nIf fossil fuels become more expensive, it could cripple the economy, but it will especially cripple the poorer economies, the Third World.  Restrict gasoline?  Food prices rise, or the next truck can't being the food to the village.  No diesel to run the generator?  No cell tower - the only source of electronic communication in much of Africa and Asia.  No heating oil?  People die of freezing in their homes.  Coal unavailable, so less electricity?  People die of heatstroke without air conditioning.\n\nTherefore, how much to attempt to control human caused global warming isn't a simple question.  It's a tradeoff of the following concepts:\n\n1.  What are the effects of global warming if we do nothing to control carbon?  \n2.  What are the benefits to our economy if we do nothing to control carbon?  \n3.  What are the changes to the effects of global warming if we control carbon?  \n4.  What are the changes to our economy if we control carbon?  \n\nEven if we assume recent warming, and we assume that warming is human caused, we can't assume that government policies will be enough to stop it.  We might be crippling our economies and causing big problems for nothing.  ", "id": "d395bfk"}], [{"comment": "There's a large point I see missing here, \"What do people have to gain\". This question is more revealing then you think.\n\nLet's start from the point that even your top comment admits, not that many people actually think climate does not change, or hasn't changed. Roman Warming periods and mini ice ages are regularly cited as climate changes.\n\nSo let's take side A. Side A has questions about various aspects of the science and the biases of those involved. Side A is mocked as \"deniers\" in the majority of the media, many express flat out hatred or even call for jailing or \"Nuremburgs\" of these people. Simply questioning *any* aspect of the issue leads to accusations of bribery.\n\nSo Side A is vilified publicly, accused of being bought, flat out threatened and mocked. This is for having any disagreement.\n\nNow side B. Side B agrees with every aspect possible, or may privately disagree about insignificant points. Side B is made to look like a saint, a progressive person looking out for the little person and humanity. They do this not because environmentalist groups help fund their campaigns of course, only oil companies do that, they do this because they are kind human beings. Side B says that if you elect their friends to power, and grant them broader powers and abilities, they can fix everything.\n\nNow think. What exactly does group A stand to gain? Everything is made harder for *asking* the questions, not even having to believe them.\n\nNow what does side B stand to gain?\n\nI figured this was an interesting way to look at this.

It's because people who argue for climate change aren't just saying \"it happens\" as an academic issue like \"2+2=4\"...they want others to *give up* something for it. \"Hey climate change...so stop using cheap fossil fuels and use more expensive alternative sources of energy\" or \"Hey climate change...so pay this carbon tax.\"\n\n2. The effects of climate change are difficult to observe to the casual layman. We don't directly feel temperatures increasing year to year (sure, there's instruments, but I mean the typical person doesn't really feel it), when it's fractions of a degree. So you're basically relying on computer models and such which the typical person isn't really going to understand. It's not something that you can just demonstrate as a backyard experiment.\n\n3. People in this thread have speculated on the motivations of people who deny climate change, i.e. \"because they're paid by the oil industry\" or whatever, but don't consider that the *proponents* of climate change seek to improve on their own situations as well (and I don't mean \"we save Earth\", I mean financially). For example, funding for studying climate change depends on the extent to which people can convince the moneyholders in the government that it's a real problem deserving money to study. The proposed solutions to climate change have pretty uniformly been to increase taxes and/or regulations, which politicians like because it increases their power (not to mention the money and power of climate change experts, since politicians need consultants on those tax schemes and regulations). The people setting up carbon markets and such are profiting from it. Basically, there are pretty good reasons why proponents of climate change stand to individually profit from it.\n\n4. There's also debate over the extent to which current climate change is human-driven, versus just natural variations due to the number of sunspots or other factors.\n\nSo basically the proponents of climate change are arguing that people should give them more money and power due to something the typical person can't observe (but the proponents say \"I've got the data, trust me!\"), when the proponents themselves seek to benefit financially from it, at a loss for the people they're aiming to convince. That's the hurdle that climate change proponents basically have to clear.\n\nAs an analogy, say someone goes to your house and says \"You know, your house is in danger of being broken into. You could lose everything or even die!\" You respond with \"Well I haven't noticed any burglaries or robberies in the area lately\", to which the someone responds \"They're there! I have data proving this! You know, I could take care of this problem for you if you let me set up a surveillance system for the low, low cost of $1000 a month...\" People will naturally have some skepticism for this. It doesn't mean climate change is right, it doesn't mean climate change is wrong, it's just that the field is not exactly permeated with altruistic people, so there's going to be some natural skepticism about it.", "id": "d399y88"}], [{"comment": "This question will result in a lot of opinions so hopefully the mods will be understanding.

The government should not prevent him from drilling whatever or wherever he wanted to increase economic wealth. \n\nClimate change denial supports an economy and society we spent hundreds of years building.

Our American society sees a steady job, an even temperament, and a large group of friends as desirable traits in a mate. This is not true on a micro level. People who are mentally ill are most certainly able to hold relationships and do have people who value our qualities but these qualities are not valued by the larger society.\n\nThere is an exception. We often value those who do not fit this constructed view of a desirable mate in hindsight. When someone makes an incredible discover we note them as being a genius or talented or influential.

I think this is a case of our success in survival clashing with our evolutionary traits. Humans need companionship.

Earlier humans would wake up and eat and then go back to sleep and repeat. Our current system has ensures success in having material needs but in doing so has required more and more isolation and less time to be with loved ones. There is also the construct of the family as a separate unit from the society. People are not supposed to be isolated so you see depression happening in societies where isolation becomes more common.

That being said...\n\nA crash or a freeze can happen for any number of reasons. But typically speaking it happens as a result of an error in the code. One possible explanation is the code is programmed to achieve something that is impossible to do achieve. For example, you have 5 apples sitting in a row and ask the computer to show you the 6th apple, it looks for and expects the 6th apple and doesn't know how to handle itself when there is no apple there! \n\nThis leads us into errors you see. Errors are actually programmed by the developer! If you get a response that says \"Apple 6 does not exist\" that is because the programmer coded a way for the computer to handle that error... if he doesn't program what to do in that case, you would wind up with a crash because the computer just doesn't know what to do.\n\nA freeze can occur if the computer is waiting for something that never happens. Let's say you are coding a social media program for example. You might begin loading a newsfeed and tell your app to do nothing until the newsfeed loads. What if the server goes down or you lose internet connection and the feed never loads. Unless you program the app in a way the it gives up after a certain number amount of, or runs on a background process, your app will never do anything until the data is received. And the data will never be received... hence the freezing.\n\nThose are just two examples, but barring any hardware failure, apps/programs freeze or crash as a result of coding errors and unforeseen or un-handled events taking place.\n\n"], [3, "Here\u2019s a simple example of a bug that can hang a computer.  \n\n(Terminology-wise: Usually when a single application freezes it\u2019s just called \u201changing,\u201d but if the entire computer stops responding to the point where you have to forcibly power it down, that\u2019s a freeze.  Freezes usually happen as a result of hardware or interactions with hardware getting fucked up, whereas hangs are mostly software-based.  Because most computers can switch between different applications to give the appearance of them all running at the same time, a single application hanging is an annoyance but the system is overall okay [unless old Windows].  However, a full freeze prevents that application-switching, and may occur entirely outside an application\u2019s \u201crealm.\u201d)\n\nSuppose you\u2019ve opened a na\u00efvely-programmed address book application, and want to look for Joe Smith\u2019s phone number.  All the information about people is stored in the computer\u2019s memory as *records*, each of which contains fields like \u201cname\u201d or \u201cphone number\u201d or \u201cpicture\u201d or \u201cdick length\u201d, and the records are strung together as a list (for simplicity of discussion) that the computer will need to search through in order to find the right record.\n\nThis particular list has records strewn about memory; you can find the first and last items in it (i.e., *head* and *tail*) by consulting two fixed-position values that tell you where those records are.  Each record has a further pair of values attached that tell you where the previous and next record are; this allows you to hop through the list from record to record, and when you want to change the list you can hook things together by rewriting the head/tail/previous/next values in different ways.\n\nNow, because of an earlier (probably invisible) software error, when you deleted a record for Idris Hudson (who still talks to her?), the list structure got corrupted slightly by the program.\n\nBut the matter at hand: Find Joe Smith in the list.\n\nThe computer finds the head: Aaron Aaronson.  That\u2019s not it.\n\nIt hops to the next record: Bertie Wooster (because the list is alphabetized in the stupidest possible way).  Not it either.\n\nThen Charles Nader, then Donnie Darko, etc. etc. until you get to Harry Harris, whose record used to be immediately before Idris\u2019 record in the list.\n\nBecause of the corruption, the \u201cnext\u201d value attached to Harry is screwed up, and instead of pointing to Joe Smith\u2019s record it points to Harry\u2019s!  Stupid programmer!\n\nBut the computer doesn\u2019t know or care that the list structure is screwed up, and the programmer certainly didn\u2019t expect that to happen so there\u2019s no protection against it.\n\nAnd so the computer hops forward to Harry Harris\u2019s record.\n\nAnd hops forward again to Harry Harris\u2019s record.\n\nAnd again to Harry Harris\u2019s record.\n\nAnd again and again, millions of times per second.  The program is now officially hanging.\n\nYou try throwing some input at it, rubbing on the phone screen with your sausage-greasy fingers.  The computer is still desperately trying to spin through the list, so input events start piling up at the program\u2019s front door.  (Interrupting programs is a delicate affair, and actual honest-to-goodness interruptions are usually reserved for things like attempting to divide by zero or execute a piece of text, where the program\u2019s fucked already and a little extra fucking won\u2019t change that.)\n\nEventually the operating system (which is in charge of keeping your computer running properly) notices the events piling up, and pokes the program once or twice (\u201cu ok?\u201d) to see if it responds and starts picking up input events.  Nothing happens; still stuck on Harry, still has a slowly expanding pile of things it\u2019s not responding to.  From outside the program, there\u2019s no general-purpose way to determine if the program is truly stuck or doing actual useful work\\*\u2014e.g., a program calculating the umpteen-millionth digit of pi might take a while to do that and appear just as hung as the poor address book app.\n\nSo at some point, you\u2019ll get the \u201cOh shits!\u201d pop-up message from the operating system (or whatever\u2019s in charge of handing off the input events).  Depending on your response, it\u2019ll either forcibly kill the program to stop wasting CPU time, or permit it to keep working for a bit longer and then ask again.\n\nIf there\u2019s a full-on hardware freeze (e.g., that coffee you dropped on your phone finally caused a short), your CPU might stop working entirely and you\u2019ll never be able to get a pop-up message about it.  Alternatively, sometimes your operating system might notice something super-wrong (RAM dropped some data, or disk dropped some data, or the graphics chip has heartburn) and lock everything up defensively so it doesn\u2019t start shitting all over the place (e.g., all over the file system with your files, photos, and other useful info).  So many ways for things to break!\n\n\\*This is an official, hard-and-fast rule in computer science called the Turing Halting Problem.  It basically states that it\u2019s not possible to write a program *P* that determines whether another, arbitrary program *Q* handed to *P* as input will ever \u201cterminate.\u201d  *P* can analyze *Q* all it wants and even execute parts of it for years at a time, but never will it be possible to state definitively whether *Q* will eventually complete its task and poop its output.

"]], [[{"comment": "It's important to understand that your phone is a computer and computers can ONLY do exactly what the are programmed to do. That being said...\n\nA crash or a freeze can happen for any number of reasons. But typically speaking it happens as a result of an error in the code. One possible explanation is the code is programmed to achieve something that is impossible to do achieve. For example, you have 5 apples sitting in a row and ask the computer to show you the 6th apple, it looks for and expects the 6th apple and doesn't know how to handle itself when there is no apple there! \n\nThis leads us into errors you see. Errors are actually programmed by the developer! If you get a response that says \"Apple 6 does not exist\" that is because the programmer coded a way for the computer to handle that error... if he doesn't program what to do in that case, you would wind up with a crash because the computer just doesn't know what to do.\n\nA freeze can occur if the computer is waiting for something that never happens. Let's say you are coding a social media program for example. You might begin loading a newsfeed and tell your app to do nothing until the newsfeed loads. What if the server goes down or you lose internet connection and the feed never loads. Unless you program the app in a way the it gives up after a certain number amount of, or runs on a background process, your app will never do anything until the data is received. And the data will never be received... hence the freezing.\n\nThose are just two examples, but barring any hardware failure, apps/programs freeze or crash as a result of coding errors and unforeseen or un-handled events taking place.\n\n", "id": "d9xhgp4"}], [{"comment": "Here\u2019s a simple example of a bug that can hang a computer.  \n\n(Terminology-wise: Usually when a single application freezes it\u2019s just called \u201changing,\u201d but if the entire computer stops responding to the point where you have to forcibly power it down, that\u2019s a freeze.  Freezes usually happen as a result of hardware or interactions with hardware getting fucked up, whereas hangs are mostly software-based.  Because most computers can switch between different applications to give the appearance of them all running at the same time, a single application hanging is an annoyance but the system is overall okay [unless old Windows].  However, a full freeze prevents that application-switching, and may occur entirely outside an application\u2019s \u201crealm.\u201d)\n\nSuppose you\u2019ve opened a na\u00efvely-programmed address book application, and want to look for Joe Smith\u2019s phone number.  All the information about people is stored in the computer\u2019s memory as *records*, each of which contains fields like \u201cname\u201d or \u201cphone number\u201d or \u201cpicture\u201d or \u201cdick length\u201d, and the records are strung together as a list (for simplicity of discussion) that the computer will need to search through in order to find the right record.\n\nThis particular list has records strewn about memory; you can find the first and last items in it (i.e., *head* and *tail*) by consulting two fixed-position values that tell you where those records are.  Each record has a further pair of values attached that tell you where the previous and next record are; this allows you to hop through the list from record to record, and when you want to change the list you can hook things together by rewriting the head/tail/previous/next values in different ways.\n\nNow, because of an earlier (probably invisible) software error, when you deleted a record for Idris Hudson (who still talks to her?), the list structure got corrupted slightly by the program.\n\nBut the matter at hand: Find Joe Smith in the list.\n\nThe computer finds the head: Aaron Aaronson.  That\u2019s not it.\n\nIt hops to the next record: Bertie Wooster (because the list is alphabetized in the stupidest possible way).  Not it either.\n\nThen Charles Nader, then Donnie Darko, etc. etc. until you get to Harry Harris, whose record used to be immediately before Idris\u2019 record in the list.\n\nBecause of the corruption, the \u201cnext\u201d value attached to Harry is screwed up, and instead of pointing to Joe Smith\u2019s record it points to Harry\u2019s!  Stupid programmer!\n\nBut the computer doesn\u2019t know or care that the list structure is screwed up, and the programmer certainly didn\u2019t expect that to happen so there\u2019s no protection against it.\n\nAnd so the computer hops forward to Harry Harris\u2019s record.\n\nAnd hops forward again to Harry Harris\u2019s record.\n\nAnd again to Harry Harris\u2019s record.\n\nAnd again and again, millions of times per second.  The program is now officially hanging.\n\nYou try throwing some input at it, rubbing on the phone screen with your sausage-greasy fingers.  The computer is still desperately trying to spin through the list, so input events start piling up at the program\u2019s front door.  (Interrupting programs is a delicate affair, and actual honest-to-goodness interruptions are usually reserved for things like attempting to divide by zero or execute a piece of text, where the program\u2019s fucked already and a little extra fucking won\u2019t change that.)\n\nEventually the operating system (which is in charge of keeping your computer running properly) notices the events piling up, and pokes the program once or twice (\u201cu ok?\u201d) to see if it responds and starts picking up input events.  Nothing happens; still stuck on Harry, still has a slowly expanding pile of things it\u2019s not responding to.  From outside the program, there\u2019s no general-purpose way to determine if the program is truly stuck or doing actual useful work\\*\u2014e.g., a program calculating the umpteen-millionth digit of pi might take a while to do that and appear just as hung as the poor address book app.\n\nSo at some point, you\u2019ll get the \u201cOh shits!\u201d pop-up message from the operating system (or whatever\u2019s in charge of handing off the input events).  Depending on your response, it\u2019ll either forcibly kill the program to stop wasting CPU time, or permit it to keep working for a bit longer and then ask again.\n\nIf there\u2019s a full-on hardware freeze (e.g., that coffee you dropped on your phone finally caused a short), your CPU might stop working entirely and you\u2019ll never be able to get a pop-up message about it.  Alternatively, sometimes your operating system might notice something super-wrong (RAM dropped some data, or disk dropped some data, or the graphics chip has heartburn) and lock everything up defensively so it doesn\u2019t start shitting all over the place (e.g., all over the file system with your files, photos, and other useful info).  So many ways for things to break!\n\n\\*This is an official, hard-and-fast rule in computer science called the Turing Halting Problem.  It basically states that it\u2019s not possible to write a program *P* that determines whether another, arbitrary program *Q* handed to *P* as input will ever \u201cterminate.\u201d  *P* can analyze *Q* all it wants and even execute parts of it for years at a time, but never will it be possible to state definitively whether *Q* will eventually complete its task and poop its output.  (And if *Q* does end up being going-to-poop its output, then you could\u2019ve found that out faster by just running *Q* directly without *P*\u2019s interference.)

The enlarged muscles are a result of finding an individual with a damaged myostatin producing gene and then encouraging the individual to produce as many offspring as possible.

The definitions I'm going to give for the different genders aren't set in stone and are debatable. But, it's a good entry point. \n\nSex is a biological trait that is related to our genes and hormones. In our DNA we have what are called sex chromosomes \"x\" and \"y\". Generally  XX chromosomes create a female sexed person and XY create a male sexed person. There are other combinations, sometimes with more than two. In addition, because of other genetic effects hormones can override these chromosomes and create other sex traits. Arguably male and female are the most common, but intersex people of varying sorts aren't particularly uncommon.\n\nGender is how we as a society expect the sexes to behave in that society but also to some extent how a person wants to interact with society with regards to their sex. So, if we looked at the US in the 50's that might mean, women have long hair. Men had short hair. Men went to work. Women stayed at home with the kids. Men liked cars. Women liked cooking. Etc. etc. etc. \n\nThe usage of new gender words is to try to express the feeling many people have that their gender is either more complicated or innaccurate than the default society wants to give. The different new genders express similar but somewhat distinct ideas.  \n\nPeople who are genderfluid tend to find that they will sometimes strongly identify with certain gender roles at different times. So a person who might love to wear very masculine suits and very feminine dresses may be genderqueer. \n\nGenderqueer is someone who finds that the normal expression of gender doesn't quite capture how they feel. They don't quite see themselves as men or as women but something amalgamated. \n\nGender neutral is someone who sees themselves as having less gendered content. \n\nOften times gender neutral, genderqueer and genderfluid are thrown around as interchangeable. They aren't exactly. But for many people they effectively are so similar and used in such a variety of ways they all end up roughly meaning \"not quite men not quite women\". \n\nAll of this is made more complicated by the fact that liberal socities are generally trying to break down gender roles as it is. While there has been great progress compared with say, the middle ages, there is still a TON of assumed gendered behavior that just doesn't capture people's lived experiences. \n\nI'm a little hungover so let me know if I need to do any clarifying! \n\nEDIT: Just to re-iterate a point. Sex is also more complicated than a lot of people are saying. There are more sexes than simply male or female so it's not just you are born male or female. Follows is a link with some info on intersex (which are those people who are born not exactly male or not exactly female). http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex\n\nEDIT 2: HOLY SHIT! Reddit gold! Thank you anonymous benefactor! This is my first ever reddit gold. I also passed the New York bar this week. It's been a good week (the reddit gold is better). \n\nI want to quickly address a few of the \"biological\" points that came up in this thread and why they don't really answer the question. \n\nSomeone pointed out that standard female brains tend to be smaller (which for those MRA people out there has absolutely zero correlation with intelligence), men usually have more testosterone etc etc. This is true. But notice how I had to use words like \"standard\" and \"tend\" to. It is not always the case that if you take 1 woman and 1 man they will always have relative differences based on those factors. Some women have bigger brains and more testosterone than some men. This then fails the  necessary 1 to 1 requirement of a definition. For example, if I said a chair has 4 legs and then showed you one with 5 legs or three legs (or none, like a rocking chair on skis), you would have to say well it's not a chair or my definition is wrong. In this instance, I think using those points may help us understand trends and tendencies (but probably not) they don't help define gender or sex.\n\nAgain I want to point out that sex is something on the biological level and unless you have a habit of DNA testing all of the people you know, you won't ever meaningfully interact with a person's sex. Because you can only ever interact with a person who has been socialized you will always interact with their gender expression. \n\nThese words help more than 1% of the population. And even if they only help 1% of the population, in the USA alone that is 3 million people. That is a lot of people. I admit, learning a few new words is an inconvenience and takes some processing power (you have to read my whole post). Once you've read the post. You now know the words and can't make the argument that you will be harmed by using the words. You already know them. Seriously though, the inconvenience is minuscule on a societal level to grasp new words.\n\nI also want to point out that the idea of non-binary gender is not new. Many cultures have had third and fluid genders. For example, North American Native Americans (exactly how many tribes is currently under debate) who had a concept of two spirits and had 4 different gender categories.  This idea of third gender and gender non conforming is even in the kama sutra. Plato's Symposium mentions a creation myth with Male, Female and Gender Neutral characters. \n\nEDIT 3: One more clarification. The reason individual gender expression and letting an individual pick their own gender is the best solution is precisely because gender on a social level is a weak concept. As many people have accurately pointed out women can wear pents, men can have long hair etc. etc. Agreed! That's why things often associated with gender aren't defining, merely associated (in fact many of the things often thought defining of gender in our times were different in other times, Pink used to be a  boys color (it was like blood and men were bloody), and in the Middle Ages in Europe women were seen as the sexual predators and men were the innocents who needed to protect themselves). Since pretty much anything associated with gender isn't a 1 to 1 it doesn't define any gender. Therefore, there is no good way to make a call as to who is or isn't a particular gender on a macro level. Therefore, the only way to accurately sort people is to just let people sort themselves. \n"], [74, "As someone in my youth stated it: \"sex is between your legs, gender is between your ears\"; sex is what you physically are, while gender is what you think of yourself as.  Although not without its limitations, it's a pretty good definition.  \nWhen they are mismatched* It's like** having a (mostly)permanent job as a factory worker when all you wanted to do your whole life was farm.  \n* gonna get crucified with that one.  \n* *  with how society in general perceives you."], [28, "I've always felt like [this image](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2015/03/the-genderbread-person-v3/) and accompanying text gave a pretty strong categorization for how sex, gender, gender expression, and attraction differ from one another."], [13, "Prior answers are dreadful.\n\nHere's info from a human behavioral biology lecture series by Stanford you can find on YouTube.\n\nThe key factors are-\n\n1) Genetic gender\n\n2) Neurological structure\n\nAs with all medical situations it's important to keep in mind that self-evaluation is unreliable for an accurate medical diagnosis especially when dealing with non-physical conditions.\n\n1) Ok so first thing is genetics- some people have XY chromosome pairs, some have XX, some have atypical pairings or other genetic factors that lead to interesting traits that totally blur the lines of distinct genetic genders. Consider hermaphroditism, hyper androgynous women and the Guevedoces. This is to be expected if you except the premise of evolution - genetic factors that effect gender are subject to the same process of mutation that the rest of the body is subject to, hence we should expect atypical (non-binary) genetic genders.\n\n2) Second thing that is incredibly important in describing gender is the internal ratio structure of the brain, this is important because these structures have been proven to be highly predictive of behavioral traits including traits like homosexuality, hyper-aggression, or some neurological disabilities.\n\nStandard female brains have distinct ratios from standard male brains. But the size of these areas are subject to variance among a population. If we except the premise that the variance in these brain ratios is most likely a normal distribution then we have to anticipate that there will be some statistical outliers who have ratios that more closely resemble the opposite gender's 'standard brain' than we would expect to see given their genetic gender.\n\nWe can also expect so of these ratios to be right in the no man's land between what we would call a typical male brain or a typical female brain. These cases roughly equate to hyperandro women or hemaphrodites who blur the gender line in the genetic arena.\n\n__\n\n\nSo what does this actually mean?\n\nIt means we can't deny the possibility that someone might have the genetics of gender A and the neurology of gender B. Or the genetics of gender A and completely unique neurology.\n\nConsequently, telling someone who has a mismatch between neurology and gender that they shouldn't have access to gender reassignment surgery or hormone supplements is a horrible thing.\n\nWhat does not mean?\n\nThis doesn't mean that gender is a social construct or that you can toy around with gender identity and flit between calling yourself a man one day and a woman the next. \n\nPretending your atypical in a genetic or neurological regard or pretending that gender is a myth is incredibly irresponsible because you delegitimize people who have actual medical conditions.\n\n\nA perhaps more horrible consequence of this 'trans-trender' movement is the danger that they might convince someone who suffers mild schizophrenia or depression that the origin of their problem is something to do with gender and gender identity. \n\nA huge portion of pre and post-operation trans people suffer from serious mental disorders and I worry that professionalism when dealing with these people is under siege by uniformed people that think gender is a myth or that gender has nothing to do with behavior."], [10, "\"Sex\" refers to your biological sex. This is in reference to what your genes define and is a more \"medical\" term than gender. Sex can be ill-defined due to some genetic factors, not plainly male or female or XY and XX respectively. Things like [Klinefelter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome), or XXY, is just one of many combinations beyond XX or XY that humans may end up with. \n\nGender is separate from you biological sex and has many factors that make a person identify as a \"man\" or a \"woman\" or somewhere in between.  Some cultures have many different genders other than male and female for social norms and place in society, such as the [Hijra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia). \n\nBasically sex is the chromosomal makeup and physical expression of your sexual reproduction. \n\nGender is how you identify with those sexual reproduction parts and the roles you accept in your society as a \"man,\" \"woman,\" or \"other\" in reference to your physicality. "], [5, "Sex is biological. It's your chromosomes, genitalia, etc. With some exceptions, people are generally male (XY) or female (XX). Intersex people (who may have different chromosomal makeup or ambiguous sex organs/genitalia) do exist and people are starting to recognize their right to control their bodies -- it's still quite common for intersex babies to have their genitals surgically altered to make them \"one or the other\". Malta became the first country (in April 2015) to outlaw such practices (though it's OK if an intersex adult explicitly consents to such a procedure). \n\nYour gender is a social, cultural, and psychological phenomenon. What we think of as \"male\" and \"female\" might have *some* roots in biological factors, but most things that we associate with male/female are cultural and social. A girl does/looks like this, a boy does/looks like that. Most people's gender lines up with their biological sex. For example, I was born with XX chromosomes, a vagina, a uterus, all that good stuff, and I identify as female, which I express by wearing my hair long/in a \"feminine\" style, wearing clothing marketed for women, going by a \"feminine\" name, and so on. I live my life as a woman, and what defines \"womanhood\" is very much rooted in the culture I grew up in. \n\nSome people's gender identity does not line up with their biological sex. Let's say that Jim was born with XX chromosomes, a uterus, vagina, the whole nine yards. Jim is biologically female. But Jim does not identify as female. Jim wears \"masculine\" clothes, wears a short haircut associated with men, goes by a traditionally masculine name, and takes hormones to stop having periods and grow more body hair. Jim identifies as male and lives his life as a man. \n\nThen there are people who don't really fall under male or female, either because they are intersex (edit: though many intersex people live as \"one or the other\", either on their own free will or due to medical interventions in childhood, which, as I mentioned further up, are starting to be recognized as wrong/unnecessary), or because they identify/live their lives as both male and female, or perhaps neither (a third gender), or no gender at all. \n\nPeople are starting to recognize a) that gender and sexuality/sex aren't so clear-cut, and b) people who don't fall into such defined boxes deserve rights and dignity like everyone else.

Gender and sex are very complicated subjects but scientists and the medical community are starting to figure out why there's a difference between gender and sex.\nYour gender (boy/girl/agender/etc) is determined by how your brain views your sex. This is influenced by;\n-The layout of your brain and how the cortexes interact (Yes! Men and women have slightly different layouts.)\n-Hormones in the womb and what kind of imprint they left on your brain and endocrine system during pregnancy\n-The amount of hormones your body produces\n-And there are many more theories out there. \n\nBeing a cisgender boy means your sex is male, you have a masculine brain layout, you were exposed to the \"correct\" amount of hormones in the womb and your hormones are within the male spectrum.\nBeing transgender boy means all of the above is true but your sex is female.\nBeing genderqueer/non-binary means that theres a mix. So maybe you have a female layout, was exposed to more male hormones, and produces more male hormones, and your sex is female.\nI hope this helped some. Its gets much more complicated when you add gender roles and gender expression.\"  \n\nA lot of these are *theories* but what it boils down to is that you are wired to see yourself as male/female/a mix. For transgender people, we have gender dysphoria due to the disconnect between our gender and sex, which is very similar to body dysmorphic disorder, but the difference is that BDD won't go away when you change your body to how you wanted it. It changes to another part of your body. Whereas gender dysphoria signifigantly lessens or goes away completely once you medically transition. Its the disconnect thats the problem- not our gender.  \n\nAdd in gender roles. I see gender roles as independent from gender. Masculine women and feminine men exist- they are still women and men but its how they choose to express their gender. Its societal and social.

The definitions I'm going to give for the different genders aren't set in stone and are debatable. But, it's a good entry point. \n\nSex is a biological trait that is related to our genes and hormones. In our DNA we have what are called sex chromosomes \"x\" and \"y\". Generally  XX chromosomes create a female sexed person and XY create a male sexed person. There are other combinations, sometimes with more than two. In addition, because of other genetic effects hormones can override these chromosomes and create other sex traits. Arguably male and female are the most common, but intersex people of varying sorts aren't particularly uncommon.\n\nGender is how we as a society expect the sexes to behave in that society but also to some extent how a person wants to interact with society with regards to their sex. So, if we looked at the US in the 50's that might mean, women have long hair. Men had short hair. Men went to work. Women stayed at home with the kids. Men liked cars. Women liked cooking. Etc. etc. etc. \n\nThe usage of new gender words is to try to express the feeling many people have that their gender is either more complicated or innaccurate than the default society wants to give. The different new genders express similar but somewhat distinct ideas.  \n\nPeople who are genderfluid tend to find that they will sometimes strongly identify with certain gender roles at different times. So a person who might love to wear very masculine suits and very feminine dresses may be genderqueer. \n\nGenderqueer is someone who finds that the normal expression of gender doesn't quite capture how they feel. They don't quite see themselves as men or as women but something amalgamated. \n\nGender neutral is someone who sees themselves as having less gendered content. \n\nOften times gender neutral, genderqueer and genderfluid are thrown around as interchangeable. They aren't exactly. But for many people they effectively are so similar and used in such a variety of ways they all end up roughly meaning \"not quite men not quite women\". \n\nAll of this is made more complicated by the fact that liberal socities are generally trying to break down gender roles as it is. While there has been great progress compared with say, the middle ages, there is still a TON of assumed gendered behavior that just doesn't capture people's lived experiences. \n\nI'm a little hungover so let me know if I need to do any clarifying! \n\nEDIT: Just to re-iterate a point. Sex is also more complicated than a lot of people are saying. There are more sexes than simply male or female so it's not just you are born male or female. Follows is a link with some info on intersex (which are those people who are born not exactly male or not exactly female). http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex\n\nEDIT 2: HOLY SHIT! Reddit gold! Thank you anonymous benefactor! This is my first ever reddit gold. I also passed the New York bar this week. It's been a good week (the reddit gold is better). \n\nI want to quickly address a few of the \"biological\" points that came up in this thread and why they don't really answer the question. \n\nSomeone pointed out that standard female brains tend to be smaller (which for those MRA people out there has absolutely zero correlation with intelligence), men usually have more testosterone etc etc. This is true. But notice how I had to use words like \"standard\" and \"tend\" to. It is not always the case that if you take 1 woman and 1 man they will always have relative differences based on those factors. Some women have bigger brains and more testosterone than some men. This then fails the  necessary 1 to 1 requirement of a definition. For example, if I said a chair has 4 legs and then showed you one with 5 legs or three legs (or none, like a rocking chair on skis), you would have to say well it's not a chair or my definition is wrong. In this instance, I think using those points may help us understand trends and tendencies (but probably not) they don't help define gender or sex.\n\nAgain I want to point out that sex is something on the biological level and unless you have a habit of DNA testing all of the people you know, you won't ever meaningfully interact with a person's sex. Because you can only ever interact with a person who has been socialized you will always interact with their gender expression. \n\nThese words help more than 1% of the population. And even if they only help 1% of the population, in the USA alone that is 3 million people. That is a lot of people. I admit, learning a few new words is an inconvenience and takes some processing power (you have to read my whole post). Once you've read the post. You now know the words and can't make the argument that you will be harmed by using the words. You already know them. Seriously though, the inconvenience is minuscule on a societal level to grasp new words.\n\nI also want to point out that the idea of non-binary gender is not new. Many cultures have had third and fluid genders. For example, North American Native Americans (exactly how many tribes is currently under debate) who had a concept of two spirits and had 4 different gender categories.  This idea of third gender and gender non conforming is even in the kama sutra. Plato's Symposium mentions a creation myth with Male, Female and Gender Neutral characters. \n\nEDIT 3: One more clarification. The reason individual gender expression and letting an individual pick their own gender is the best solution is precisely because gender on a social level is a weak concept. As many people have accurately pointed out women can wear pents, men can have long hair etc. etc. Agreed! That's why things often associated with gender aren't defining, merely associated (in fact many of the things often thought defining of gender in our times were different in other times, Pink used to be a  boys color (it was like blood and men were bloody), and in the Middle Ages in Europe women were seen as the sexual predators and men were the innocents who needed to protect themselves). Since pretty much anything associated with gender isn't a 1 to 1 it doesn't define any gender. Therefore, there is no good way to make a call as to who is or isn't a particular gender on a macro level. Therefore, the only way to accurately sort people is to just let people sort themselves. \n", "id": "d9cpzle"}, {"comment": "Alright, thank you.", "id": "d9d4n4m"}, {"comment": "Just to add to everything /u/spilgrim16 said: transgender is when your gender doesn't match your sex (e.g. you have XY chromosomes but are uncomfortable with a male role in society and prefer she/her pronouns).

Jim identifies as male and lives his life as a man. \n\nThen there are people who don't really fall under male or female, either because they are intersex (edit: though many intersex people live as \"one or the other\", either on their own free will or due to medical interventions in childhood, which, as I mentioned further up, are starting to be recognized as wrong/unnecessary), or because they identify/live their lives as both male and female, or perhaps neither (a third gender), or no gender at all. \n\nPeople are starting to recognize a) that gender and sexuality/sex aren't so clear-cut, and b) people who don't fall into such defined boxes deserve rights and dignity like everyone else.

Gender and sex are very complicated subjects but scientists and the medical community are starting to figure out why there's a difference between gender and sex.\nYour gender (boy/girl/agender/etc) is determined by how your brain views your sex. This is influenced by;\n-The layout of your brain and how the cortexes interact (Yes! Men and women have slightly different layouts.)\n-Hormones in the womb and what kind of imprint they left on your brain and endocrine system during pregnancy\n-The amount of hormones your body produces\n-And there are many more theories out there. \n\nBeing a cisgender boy means your sex is male, you have a masculine brain layout, you were exposed to the \"correct\" amount of hormones in the womb and your hormones are within the male spectrum.\nBeing transgender boy means all of the above is true but your sex is female.\nBeing genderqueer/non-binary means that theres a mix. So maybe you have a female layout, was exposed to more male hormones, and produces more male hormones, and your sex is female.\nI hope this helped some. Its gets much more complicated when you add gender roles and gender expression.\"  \n\nA lot of these are *theories* but what it boils down to is that you are wired to see yourself as male/female/a mix. For transgender people, we have gender dysphoria due to the disconnect between our gender and sex, which is very similar to body dysmorphic disorder, but the difference is that BDD won't go away when you change your body to how you wanted it. It changes to another part of your body. Whereas gender dysphoria signifigantly lessens or goes away completely once you medically transition. Its the disconnect thats the problem- not our gender.  \n\nAdd in gender roles. I see gender roles as independent from gender. Masculine women and feminine men exist- they are still women and men but its how they choose to express their gender. Its societal and social. Im not FtM because im masculine, I'm FtM because I'm wired for a male body and got a female one.  \nI hope this helped some.

If you subtract the biggest multiple of 9 less than that number from that number, you get what's called the remainder modulo 9. For instance, the biggest multiple of 9 less than 212 is 207 (9*23), so the remainder of 212 modulo 9 is 212-207=5. \n\nLet's call two numbers *congruent* if they have the same remainder modulo 9. Equivalently, they're congruent if the difference between them is a multiple of 9. I'll write \"a is congruent to b\" as \"a~b\". We can now see some rules:\n\n1. If a~b and c~d, then (a+c)~(b+d). That's because (b+d)-(a+c)=(b-a)+(d-c); b~a and d~c, so b-a and d-c are both multiples of 9, so their sum is also a multiple of 9.\n2. If a~b and b~c, then a~c. This is a special case of above. Because b~c, (c-b)~0. So, (a+0)~(b+(c-b))=c.\n3. If a~b, then (a\\*c)~(b\\*c). The difference is (b\\*c-a\\*c)=(b-a)\\*c (by the distributive principle); (b-a) is a multiple of 9, so (b-a)\\*c is also a multiple of 9, so (a\\*c)~(b\\*c).\n4. If a~b and c~d, then (a\\*c)~(b\\*d). Because a~b, (a\\*c)~(b\\*c). Because c~d, (b\\*c)~(b\\*d). By rule 2, that means (a\\*c)~(b\\*d).\n\nNow, we can make some observations. 10 is equal to 9+1. So, 10~1. That means that 100~1 as well: (10\\*10)~(1\\*1)=1. And likewise for any power of 10; they're all equivalent to 1.\n\nWhen you write a number like 212, what you're writing really means (2\\*100)+(1\\*10)+(2\\*1). By rule 4, (2\\*100)~(2\\*1)=2. Likewise, (1\\*10)~1. So, we see that 212~(2+1+2). *All* numbers are congruent to the sum of their digits, because adding 2 to the sum instead of 200 doesn't change the remainder mod 9.\n\nAnd that's why your rule works. Your digit sum is just the remainder mod 9. The remainder of the sum of two numbers is congruent to the sum of their remainders, by rule 1. No number between 1 and 9 is congruent to any other number between 1 and 9, so if you keep adding down to single digits, any number will eventually get to its remainder."], [1, "I fear I don't know the 'why' of the OP's question, but I do know that you can use this method to determine if any number is divisible by 3.

In proper sums you get extra 1 in the sum if you roll past 9, like 16+6 rolls past 19... but so does 6+6 roll over as well, so the sum remains the same, you just lose the track of where the extra 1 should go in proper sum."], [1, "First, note that the digital root of a number is just the remainder you get when you divide that number by 9. For example, 16/9 = 1 remainder 7, and 1+6 = 7. If the number is evenly divide by 9, then we'll just take 9 as the digital root (not 0). For example, the digital root of 81 is 9 since 81 is evenly divisible by 9 (and of course 8+1=9).\n\nSecondly, also note that we can represent ANY whole number as 9x+y, where x and y are also whole numbers. For example, 57 is 9(6)+3 = 54 + 3 = 57. 449 = 9(49) + 8. (Also note that 3 is the digital root of 57, and 8 is of 449). \n\nThirdly, let's introduce some notation. We'll say that D(x) represents the digital root of a number x. For example, D(12)=1+2=3. \n\nSo, if we consider a + b = c, then we can let a=9x+y and b=9w+z (where x,y,w,z are positive whole numbers). Now remember, the digital root of a number is the remainder you get when you divide by 9. So with a and b, we know that a's digital root is y, and that b's is z (unless y or z are 0, in which case it's 9). Now let's add them: \n  \na + b = (9x + y) + (9w + z) \nOR\na + b = (9x + 9w) + (y +z)  \n\nAll I did was rearrange the things on the right hand side. What do we know about (9x + 9w)? It's divisible by 9! What does that mean then? It means that (y+z) is the digital root of c (remember, a+b = (9x + 9w) + (y +z) = c).\n\n So what I've shown now is that since a+b=c, we also have D(a) + D(b) = D(c). \n\n I could stop the proof here, but let me walk you through the reasoning. Take your first example: 16+6=22. \n\n D(16) = 1+6 = 7 (because of your way of adding the digits AND because 16/9 = 1 remainder 7)\n D(6) = 6 (same deal here since 6/9=0 remainder 6)\n\nNow we add the two digital roots and take theirs: 1+6+6= 13 -> D(13) = 4\n\nAnd doing the c is easy, since all we're computing is D(22) which is also 4.\n\nI know this is still a little math'y, but an understanding of basic algebra should get you there."], [-1, "What?

If you subtract the biggest multiple of 9 less than that number from that number, you get what's called the remainder modulo 9. For instance, the biggest multiple of 9 less than 212 is 207 (9*23), so the remainder of 212 modulo 9 is 212-207=5. \n\nLet's call two numbers *congruent* if they have the same remainder modulo 9. Equivalently, they're congruent if the difference between them is a multiple of 9. I'll write \"a is congruent to b\" as \"a~b\". We can now see some rules:\n\n1. If a~b and c~d, then (a+c)~(b+d). That's because (b+d)-(a+c)=(b-a)+(d-c); b~a and d~c, so b-a and d-c are both multiples of 9, so their sum is also a multiple of 9.\n2. If a~b and b~c, then a~c. This is a special case of above. Because b~c, (c-b)~0. So, (a+0)~(b+(c-b))=c.\n3. If a~b, then (a\\*c)~(b\\*c). The difference is (b\\*c-a\\*c)=(b-a)\\*c (by the distributive principle); (b-a) is a multiple of 9, so (b-a)\\*c is also a multiple of 9, so (a\\*c)~(b\\*c).\n4. If a~b and c~d, then (a\\*c)~(b\\*d). Because a~b, (a\\*c)~(b\\*c). Because c~d, (b\\*c)~(b\\*d). By rule 2, that means (a\\*c)~(b\\*d).\n\nNow, we can make some observations. 10 is equal to 9+1. So, 10~1. That means that 100~1 as well: (10\\*10)~(1\\*1)=1. And likewise for any power of 10; they're all equivalent to 1.\n\nWhen you write a number like 212, what you're writing really means (2\\*100)+(1\\*10)+(2\\*1). By rule 4, (2\\*100)~(2\\*1)=2. Likewise, (1\\*10)~1. So, we see that 212~(2+1+2). *All* numbers are congruent to the sum of their digits, because adding 2 to the sum instead of 200 doesn't change the remainder mod 9.\n\nAnd that's why your rule works. Your digit sum is just the remainder mod 9. The remainder of the sum of two numbers is congruent to the sum of their remainders, by rule 1. No number between 1 and 9 is congruent to any other number between 1 and 9, so if you keep adding down to single digits, any number will eventually get to its remainder.", "id": "d4dwf8p"}, {"comment": "not sure i follow", "id": "d4dwopn"}, {"comment": "Let's take it through steps. It wasn't a great explanation.\n\nWhat I'm trying to show you is that if you do the digit sum, and subtract it from the original number, you get a multiple of 9. There's only one number between 1 and 9 that, subtracted from 212, gives you a multiple of 9; this number happens to be 5. This is the remainder. Let's say you're adding 212 and 106. 106-7=99, which is a multiple of 9, so 106's remainder is 7. The remainder of 212+106=318 is 3: 318-3=315=9\\*35.\n\nHere's the thing to notice. If you add the remainders of 212 and 106, you get 12. The remainder of 12 is 3 -- exactly the same as the remainder of 212+106. This is always true. The sum of two numbers has the same remainder as the sum of their remainders. It's true because when you added 212 and 106, you were adding (multiple of 9)+5 to (multiple of 9)+7. This is a multiple of 9 plus 12. The sum of the numbers and the sum of their remainders differ by a multiple of 9, and adding a multiple of 9 to a number doesn't affect the remainder.\n\nSo, we know that if you take the remainder of the sum of the remainders, that equals the remainder of the sum of the original numbers.

In proper sums you get extra 1 in the sum if you roll past 9, like 16+6 rolls past 19... but so does 6+6 roll over as well, so the sum remains the same, you just lose the track of where the extra 1 should go in proper sum.", "id": "d4du0bk"}, {"comment": "I'll try a bit longer version.\n\nConsider 213 + 16\n\nThat's the same as (200 + 10 + 3) + (10 + 6).

This is because when adding tens, you know the result will have that one zero at the end. 30 + 40 = 70. 18370 + 7360 is something large but it will have 0 at the end.

What is enough to make one species of animal classified separately from the rest?\n\nThat's the crux of the issue. The word is a mess. Some people will tell you animals that can't interbreed, but that's only one common separating factor, and not the whole story. For instance, you have ring species where geographically remote members of the species cannot interbreed, but some other member 'in the middle' can breed with both. How many species is that? 3? 2? 1? You've got an entire kingdom that reproduces asexually. So they don't even have sex and breed. How many species is that, 1? Eleventy bajillion? You've got animals we already consider separate species, that can breed together. Oops?!\n\nThe main thing to bear in mind is that the differences between humans are very minor. Skin color? We've got all kinds of colored cats, but they're still 'domestic cat.' \n\nA white man from Portugal and a white man from Siberia may have more genetic differences between them, than a white man and a black man. After all, interracial marriages can produce children we consider to be one race, or the other. That means you can have someone with half the genetic code of someone else, and we consider them a different race. And their kid could be identified as the other race too. Does a distinction that can flip flop in a single generation make any sense? Of course not.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, ultimately, is that the way we classify race is very very arbitrary, just differences we think \"look\" important, but which have no particularly special place of importance in our genetics. "], [24, "Because \"looking different\" isn't enough to differentiate between species.\n\nA hairless sphynx cat isn't genetically different enough from a siamese to be a different species, even though they appear different. Similarly, a pomeranian and a great dane aren't significantly different genetically, despite the massive size difference."], [36, "There's less difference between human 'races' than between breeds of dogs, and dog breeds aren't considered separate species."], [58, " Two animals are considered to be of different species if they can't produce fertile offspring. This isn't the case for people of different races. Furthermore, race is not considered a particularly meaningful category in biology. "], [13, "Taxonomy is based on genetics, not looks. Different species have different chromosomes and cannot reproduce with one another. A poodle and a bulldog look very different but are the same species, whereas a zebra and a horse are different species."], [42, "because we aren't different species. bears are, there is more that is different between a polar bear and a black bear than just the color of their fur, some can't interbreed etc. we are anatomically all the same"], [3, "human beings a extremely closely related compared to other animals, we diverged as a species only 250k years ago, from a small population, so there is little diversity if compared to chimps say who have been around 5m years.  All humans can breed with other, which is one of things that 2 different species find hard to do ( not impossible). \n\nAll the species you talk about have been around for mns of years, chimps 5m, gorillas 8m, and then were separated within the species sometimes geographically. ( with chimps with was the congo river, that split the caused common chimp, and bonobo chimp)\n\nSo although we look quite different, underneath we aren't."], [3, "Part of the problem is the the term \"species\" . It is rather fowled up. The term came into usage as a classification before it had a clear definition. People still argue about it. But the bottom line is, basically, a \"species\" divides animals that can and cannot breed. I've heard some people try to put that definition of *genus*. But those people seem to have odd motives. In any case, despite the modern definition, there are legacy species names that do not fit the definition. Hence the confusion. At some point I expect a new modern taxonomic system is going to have to take over -- I just pray that it doesn't have to be written in a dead language anymore."], [3, "We have not had enough genetic isolation to become different species. We are only very marginally different in phenotypes but can still produce fertile offspring when we have sex. \n\nIn general to be a separate species they have to be unable to consistently have fertile offspring. If they can have fertile offspring they are just different variants of the same species. Within humans we call this races, within dogs and other domesticated animals we call it breeds, within wild animals we tend to call them sub-species. "], [3, "There used to be different species of hominids/ns - species like neanderthals and denovians (although they did interbreed with modern humans) as well as the more obvious homo habilis, homo erectus, etc..."], [3, "Becausr all human races can pork each other real hard until they produce mix raced babies. With different species porking each other  you either get nothing, or sub species that are sterile. "], [2, "One definition used in high school biology for a species is: \"A group of individuals who can and do interbreed of their own accord and produce fertile offspring\"\n\nHumans fit that definition just fine."], [1, "This question is really great because it touches on something that anthropologists love to bring up: Biological \"race\" just doesn't exist. \n\nWhat you and I call \"race\" is entirely a social construct our society uses to categorize people for lots of different reasons. Humans have extremely wide variations in terms of physical traits. It's the reason why we have thrived in pretty much every environment. Put a polar bear in the desert or the rainforest and he's gonna have a bad time. Take humans from Africa and plop them in Sweden and over time that population will adapt to fit in their environment.\n\nSkin coloration, which is what most Europeans/Americans conflate with race varies based on where you are in reason to the equator and elevation. Closer to the equator means more direct sunlight which means more UV radiation. UV breaks down folic acid in the skin. Low folic acid levels in pregnant women lead to birth defects and their offspring will either die or be too sick to be reproductively successful. People with more melanocytes have darker skin which protects from UV. So in places with lots of direct sunlight (africa, australia, south asia) people are typically darker. In places with lots of sunlight the people with darker skin will be more reproductively successful and pass onn those dark skin genes.\n\nIf you took a colony of white folks and drppped them off in Nigeria and took away their neonatal vitamins (like folic acid), over time (hundreds to thousands of years) that group of people will grow darker and darker on their own WITHOUT intermarrying with locals.\n\nThis didn't make dark skinned and light skinned people different species any more than being blonde or brunette makes you a different species. \n\nTL;DR biological race doesnt exist and human variation doesnt make different populations different species.\n"], [1, "Race is a silly division biologically speaking. I mean it's a single phenotype and you're deciding that this divides them? I mean yeah, other phenotypes segregate along those lines too, but loads don't. It makes as much sense to say \"Oh this is Human type Black and this is Human type White and this is Human type East Asian\" as it does to say \"This is human type joined earlobe and Human type non-joined earlobe.\" or \"this is human type Can-Roll-Tounge\" or \"this is human type Can Move Ears\" etc.\n\nAll of those are genetic based phenotypes and based on lineage. Heck, there can be more genetic distance between two groups of black people in Africa who might have different width noses or different length index fingers, than there are between a black person and a white person.\n\nThe only reason we have these distinctions on the prevalence of a pigment is because humans are super lazy. \"You are a different colour\" is easy to see. \n\nOh and as someone trying to show that I discovered a species or sub species, the border is waaaaay less precise than you would think. You can go by breeding ability, or chromosomal matching, or mitochondrial compatibility etc... all work for some, all fail at others.

Some people will tell you animals that can't interbreed, but that's only one common separating factor, and not the whole story. For instance, you have ring species where geographically remote members of the species cannot interbreed, but some other member 'in the middle' can breed with both. How many species is that? 3? 2? 1? You've got an entire kingdom that reproduces asexually. So they don't even have sex and breed. How many species is that, 1? Eleventy bajillion? You've got animals we already consider separate species, that can breed together. Oops?!\n\nThe main thing to bear in mind is that the differences between humans are very minor. Skin color? We've got all kinds of colored cats, but they're still 'domestic cat.' \n\nA white man from Portugal and a white man from Siberia may have more genetic differences between them, than a white man and a black man. After all, interracial marriages can produce children we consider to be one race, or the other. That means you can have someone with half the genetic code of someone else, and we consider them a different race. And their kid could be identified as the other race too. Does a distinction that can flip flop in a single generation make any sense? Of course not.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, ultimately, is that the way we classify race is very very arbitrary, just differences we think \"look\" important, but which have no particularly special place of importance in our genetics.

Put a polar bear in the desert or the rainforest and he's gonna have a bad time. Take humans from Africa and plop them in Sweden and over time that population will adapt to fit in their environment.\n\nSkin coloration, which is what most Europeans/Americans conflate with race varies based on where you are in reason to the equator and elevation. Closer to the equator means more direct sunlight which means more UV radiation. UV breaks down folic acid in the skin. Low folic acid levels in pregnant women lead to birth defects and their offspring will either die or be too sick to be reproductively successful. People with more melanocytes have darker skin which protects from UV. So in places with lots of direct sunlight (africa, australia, south asia) people are typically darker. In places with lots of sunlight the people with darker skin will be more reproductively successful and pass onn those dark skin genes.\n\nIf you took a colony of white folks and drppped them off in Nigeria and took away their neonatal vitamins (like folic acid), over time (hundreds to thousands of years) that group of people will grow darker and darker on their own WITHOUT intermarrying with locals.\n\nThis didn't make dark skinned and light skinned people different species any more than being blonde or brunette makes you a different species. \n\nTL;DR biological race doesnt exist and human variation doesnt make different populations different species.\n", "id": "d623m81"}], [{"comment": "Race is a silly division biologically speaking.

Heck, there can be more genetic distance between two groups of black people in Africa who might have different width noses or different length index fingers, than there are between a black person and a white person.\n\nThe only reason we have these distinctions on the prevalence of a pigment is because humans are super lazy. \"You are a different colour\" is easy to see. \n\nOh and as someone trying to show that I discovered a species or sub species, the border is waaaaay less precise than you would think.

As far as I'm aware, English is a rather easy language to learn. The fact that it doesn't have grammatical gender (like French, German, Russian etc.) and doesn't have grammatical cases (like German, Finnish, Russian) makes it rather easy from a grammatical standpoint. Of course, English orthography and phonology is rather complicated, but it isn't necessarily more complicated than most other languages. As someone who speaks both German (which English is closely related to) and Portuguese (which is a Romance language and thus shares many words with English due to its French influence), learning English was really easy for me, but I still consider English phonology to be rather difficult compared to most Romance languages. \n\nHere is an example of how I was able to use my knowledge of both German and Portuguese to my advantage. English words such as *example*, *part*, *honest*, *public*, *important*, *impossible*, *necessary*, *different* have Portuguese equivalents that look very similar to English: *exemplo*, *parte*, *honesto*, *p\u00fablico*, *importante*, *imposs\u00edvel*, *necess\u00e1rio*, *diferente*. However, English is actually considered a Germanic language from a linguistic standpoint with simply a large amount of Romance vocabulary. As such, English words *hand*, *winter*, *sink*, *find*, *sand*, *sea*, *house*, *mouse* and many others have very similar German equivalents: *Hand*, *Winter*, *sinken*, *finden*, *Sand*, *See*, *Haus*, *Maus* (the two last ones are pronounced exactly the same as in English). However, it is important to note that the first row of words (*example*, *part*, *honest*, *public*, *important*, *impossible*, *necessary*, *different*) is completely different in German: *Beispiel*, *Teil*, *ehrlich*, *\u00f6ffentlich*, *wichtig*, *unm\u00f6glich*, *n\u00f6tig*, *anders*. This is because German uses Germanic words while English uses words derived from Latin for these concepts. Furthermore, the second row of words (*hand*, *winter*, *sink*, *find*, *sand*, *sea*, *house*, *mouse*) is completely different in Portuguese: *m\u00e3o*, *inverno*, *afundar*, *achar*, *areia*, *mar*, *casa*, *rato*. Here, English uses Germanic words for these concepts, whereas Portuguese uses words derived from Latin.\n\nHowever, I can imagine that for someone who speaks Chinese, which has a much simpler grammatical system than English and a completely different phonological and writing system, English can indeed be a hard language to learn, but I bet that even in their case they'd have a harder time learning German than English.\n\nAlso, if anyone is curious about me, I was born in Brazil and came to Switzerland when I was 7. My native language is Brazilian Portuguese, but I learned German very quickly once I migrated to Switzerland. Some time later, I decided to learn English. Now I am perfectly fluent in German, English and Portuguese. I also study English linguistics, so I do know enough about English etymology (the origin of words) and morphology (how words are constructed, such as plurals or conjugation) to compare it to other languages. I also speak French and Italian and I have studied Latin, so I suppose I should have a fairly good idea of how difficult English is compared to other languages out there. However, all the languages I know fluently belong to only two Indo-European (the larger language family that English, German, French, Russian, Greek and even Hindi belong to) language families: Germanic (which is derived from Proto-Germanic and includes German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic and also English) and Romance (which is derived from Latin and includes French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese). Therefore, my experience may be a tad limited, so I'm sure that someone who speaks Chinese or any other language that is wildly different from English might have some better input into how hard a language English really is. However, I know enough about the grammatical structures of non-Indo-European languages to know that some of them can seem quite alien to an English speaker and hence English itself can seem rather alien to them.

For instance: in Spanish, even irregular verbs follow a pattern -- ir (to go), voy (I go), va (he/she/it/Formal You goes), vas (you go), vamos (we go), van (they/Formal Y'all go). Just look at how I translated that into English. Much less intuitive. \n\nInversion -- you often hear English learners ask questions like \"You are going to the store?\" instead of \"Are you going to the store?\" Many languages invert verbs in questions, but a lot don't. \n\nAuxiliary Verbs (be, do have), which can be hard to figure out, especially if you're coming from a language that doesn't use them, or uses them differently. \n\nSpelling and pronunciation. Really, really weird and irregular.\n\nI don't think any language is the \"hardest\" to learn because that can be so incredibly relative, but there are definitely some things in English that can be hard to grasp.

Usually, when people learn a language, it'll be one spoken by people nearby, and languages close to each other tend to be similar. But English is learned by people all over the world, with different expectations of how languages ought to work, and this is bound to cause some people to never fully learn it.\n\nThat said, from a purely linguistic point of view, all languages convey the same information and have the same complexity (this doesn't translate to perceived complexity when learning a language, nor to the average time it takes an adult to learn it, however).\n\nAlso, English is probably the easiest language to learn, not for any linguistic reason (no claim of a language being the easiest to learn is grounded in linguistics), but rather because it has the most resources to immerse oneself in."], [-3, "Two co-workers, one Vietnamese and the other German, were mocking us Americans for not knowing how to speak multiple languages. They remarked that of all nationalities Americans were, proportionately speaking, the least likely to know how to speak another language. \n\nI simply told them to consider where they were. They immigrated to America, thus they had to learn the language. They were compelled, driven by their desire to succeed in life, to learn a necessary skill, English. Even if they had zero intentions of moving to the US they still knew enough, as the world has taught them, that to speak English fluently is almost paramount. No one needs to know how to speak Vietnamese or French or German, except those who live in these countries and the occasional vacationer or missionary worker. The world does not run on German or French or Russian or even Chinese (yet), so why bother learning the language. \n\nEnglish was adopted as the \u201cinternational\u201d language years ago.

Even though Hindi has more native speakers, they all pretty much reside in India. Hardly anyone wants to move to these countries so hardly anyone bothers to learn the language. \n\nInternational airline pilots the world-over must speak English. Regardless of where they live or what nation they call home, if they are an international airline pilot they must speak English. The same goes for air traffic control workers who deal with international flights. No one needs to have to know French or German, only English. \n\nBottom line, it is this necessity and its predominance the world over that has made English \u201ceasy\u201d to learn. Whenever your personal and career goals require learning a new skill then miraculously that which is required becomes easy if only because you have focus, the only other option being failure is often not an option. I had to learn a skill-set for my job. My livelihood depended on me learning this new skill-set. Subsequently I placed all of my focus on learning and thus found it easy. Had I been tasked with learning something that was merely optional I probably would\u2019ve found it \u201chard\u201d if only because I would have had zero incentive. Thus even an easy task becomes difficult. \n\n\nImmersion plays a role as well. If one is \u201cimmersed\u201d in something, be it a new culture, language, job whatever, then yeah, you will learn. Like it or not, you can\u2019t help but pick up on things. Right now we here in America are becoming something akin to immersed in the Spanish language. We have a decent-sized demographic that speaks Spanish as their first language and a growing list of governmental rules and regulations requiring Spanish labels and such. We who have zero desire to learn Spanish are slowly being taught to speak the language whether we like it or not, whether we realize it or not. That same dynamic is at work with the English language throughout the world, and has been for many decades. A lot of French, German, Italian etc. natives, living in their own countries, have learned English words, phrases and entire sentences merely by being exposed via signs posted on their streets for tourists, imported television shows and movies, music, etc. Almost all French people know who Michael Jackson is, they know his songs and can sing them in English. No one knows any current French popstar or their songs. The closest the French came was with Edith Pilaf, back in the 40\u2019s.  And we did have one decent German song, \u201c99 Luftballoons\u201d, back in the 80\u2019s. \n\n\nAmericans, for the most part, don't \"have\" to learn another language primarily because we are already living where the rest of the world wants to live, where English is the native tongue.

For shits and grins. Almost none of these ever had any intention of immigrating to the land where that foreign language is native.

Just look at how I translated that into English. Much less intuitive. \n\nInversion -- you often hear English learners ask questions like \"You are going to the store?\" instead of \"Are you going to the store?\" Many languages invert verbs in questions, but a lot don't. \n\nAuxiliary Verbs (be, do have), which can be hard to figure out, especially if you're coming from a language that doesn't use them, or uses them differently. \n\nSpelling and pronunciation.

They remarked that of all nationalities Americans were, proportionately speaking, the least likely to know how to speak another language. \n\nI simply told them to consider where they were. They immigrated to America, thus they had to learn the language. They were compelled, driven by their desire to succeed in life, to learn a necessary skill, English. Even if they had zero intentions of moving to the US they still knew enough, as the world has taught them, that to speak English fluently is almost paramount. No one needs to know how to speak Vietnamese or French or German, except those who live in these countries and the occasional vacationer or missionary worker. The world does not run on German or French or Russian or even Chinese (yet), so why bother learning the language. \n\nEnglish was adopted as the \u201cinternational\u201d language years ago. It is the most widely spoken language in the world, and it\u2019s usage is growing in countries all over the world; http://www.businessinsider.com/firms-adopt-english-as-official-language-2014-2. \n\nThat is to say, even though Mandarin has more adherents, they all pretty much live in China. Even though Hindi has more native speakers, they all pretty much reside in India. Hardly anyone wants to move to these countries so hardly anyone bothers to learn the language. \n\nInternational airline pilots the world-over must speak English. Regardless of where they live or what nation they call home, if they are an international airline pilot they must speak English. The same goes for air traffic control workers who deal with international flights. No one needs to have to know French or German, only English. \n\nBottom line, it is this necessity and its predominance the world over that has made English \u201ceasy\u201d to learn. Whenever your personal and career goals require learning a new skill then miraculously that which is required becomes easy if only because you have focus, the only other option being failure is often not an option. I had to learn a skill-set for my job. My livelihood depended on me learning this new skill-set. Subsequently I placed all of my focus on learning and thus found it easy. Had I been tasked with learning something that was merely optional I probably would\u2019ve found it \u201chard\u201d if only because I would have had zero incentive. Thus even an easy task becomes difficult. \n\n\nImmersion plays a role as well. If one is \u201cimmersed\u201d in something, be it a new culture, language, job whatever, then yeah, you will learn. Like it or not, you can\u2019t help but pick up on things. Right now we here in America are becoming something akin to immersed in the Spanish language. We have a decent-sized demographic that speaks Spanish as their first language and a growing list of governmental rules and regulations requiring Spanish labels and such. We who have zero desire to learn Spanish are slowly being taught to speak the language whether we like it or not, whether we realize it or not. That same dynamic is at work with the English language throughout the world, and has been for many decades. A lot of French, German, Italian etc. natives, living in their own countries, have learned English words, phrases and entire sentences merely by being exposed via signs posted on their streets for tourists, imported television shows and movies, music, etc. Almost all French people know who Michael Jackson is, they know his songs and can sing them in English. No one knows any current French popstar or their songs. The closest the French came was with Edith Pilaf, back in the 40\u2019s.  And we did have one decent German song, \u201c99 Luftballoons\u201d, back in the 80\u2019s. \n\n\nAmericans, for the most part, don't \"have\" to learn another language primarily because we are already living where the rest of the world wants to live, where English is the native tongue. Although we have a great number of Americans who do speak at least one foreign language fluently, most of those who learned while growing up only did so as a, for lack of a better term, side project. For shits and grins. Almost none of these ever had any intention of immigrating to the land where that foreign language is native. So if French or German or Vietnamese proves \u201cdifficult\u201d it is probably because the level of focus is less and the level of impact, should one fail, is less severe.  \n\n", "id": "d0ewd6b"}], [{"comment": "I don't know if I would say English is the **Hardest**.

The laws of physics have no borders, so a lot of companies, in order to sell everywhere, have to meet certain standards.  Even if they wanted to, a lot of things can't be done.  Cars have to be so aerodynamic and have to, say, be designed to protect pedestrians if hit (there's a reason people mostly go on the hood and not under it now).", "id": "d3n1hm3"}], [{"comment": "When there was a clutch, the pedals were  mostly the same size, the brake pedal was sometimes higher than the gas - not always.\n\nWhen there was no need for a clutch, someone decided that it would be nice to have a larger brake, what happens is that when a driver has driven a manual shift for any length of time and needs to stop suddenly, they will also hit the phantom clutch pedal hard.\n\nThe size does not bother me anymore, or that I am missing a pedal.\n\nThose who use their left foot for the brake, should be aware that if they are resting their foot there, the lights are on.  There is no warning that they are braking.   I would consult a lawyer if driving WITHOUT lights that COME ON while braking is legal.\n\n", "id": "d3nwwpl"}], [{"comment": "Why can't you spell \"Brake\" properly?\n\nOr most people, for that matter?\n\nELI5 answer:  Smart Phones, Dumb People.", "id": "d3nkxsi"}], [{"comment": "Because stopping is MUCH more important than taking off.
