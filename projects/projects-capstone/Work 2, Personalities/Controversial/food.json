Leave in fridge for 1 or 2 hours\n\nStep 2.5) add dry rub if using. I'm partial to the big bad beef rub linked in the recipe at the end of this write up. \n\nStep 3) cook in oven preheated to 225 degrees (smoker also works). Use a thermometer not a timer. You want to pull the steak out when the lowest internal temp is 115 degrees for.\n\nStep 4) immediately sear on roaring hot grill or cast iron pan if grill unavailable. The cross hatching on this is absolutely beautiful - but from a taste perspective it will be just as good with once a side. Don't sweat it if you have trouble recreating that piece of awesomeness\n\nStep 5) cut and eat. No need to rest. Experiments with weighing steak show that juices aren't lost when cutting immediately.

Plus the outside isn't soft -cold fat congeals and becomes waxy\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you stranger for my first gold!

The tl;dr of your question is use oil to sear don't use olive oil. \n\nThe quicker the sear the more of the inside of the steak stays medium rare (or whatever your target temp is) and the juicier the steak is.

Vegetable is mid range and dirt cheap peanut is even higher if you have it theoretically you should slap the meat on right before it starts to smoke\n\nDry is a mixed bag.

However, given the fact that I live it daily, here goes. \n\nThere's the agreement that people are too clean in the west. For the sake of this, west means you don't live in a village or jungle and have power and running water. In the west we're clean from day one, meaning the body doesn't get to \"learn\" from the bacteria. \n\nC-sections are on the rise. When a baby passes through the vaginal canal, it's coated with a special bacteria that has \"instructions\" for digestion. Mother's produce a lot of it in the third trimester. \n\nChemicals in the air and water. It's all new and we honestly don't know how they individually or as a combo effect people. Boy are we learning the hard way. \n\nChange in manufacturing. Gluten 60 years ago was different from what we have today. Now it's made for high yield, cheap food, and mass production. Again, we don't really know what happens to people if they consume it over time. \n\nInstant meals. remember after WW2 the intro of mass marketing via tv and microwave meals? Those were our parents. You can pass on weird stuff to your kids. \n\nWhat we feed animals. It's simply not normal. Cows were made to eat grass, not corn. It actually makes them sick. Which brings me to my next point:\n\nOveruse of antibiotics with animals. It's in our food supply. Anyone that says that won't effect you is simply in denial. You know how you drank your mother's milk and got nutrients from her? Food is no different. \n\nPesticides and GMOs. We didn't use them this much until 1997. This is literally the world's largest human experiment. We are living through the big question of what happens if we....?\n\nStill with me? I know it's a long one. Here's the kicker, in certain Asian countries, they don't even know what food allergies are really. One of our kids is from South Korea (close family friends, she's here for high school). She had no idea what it all was and was shocked by all the \"rules\" we have in our house to keep everyone safe. Also, a lot of the weird items in our food supply is banned in other countries.\n\nFood allergies are on the rise, and so are lethal autoimmune issues like mine. I'm the exception, not the rule. However, in ten years, if things don't change, there will be a lot more people like me sadly. If you want to read my personal story, go to freeandfriendlyfoods.com. We have a long write up there. \n\nOK, sorry for the longwinded answer, but that's what I think some of the key issues are.

I think Patsy Grimaldi had to change it for legal reasons or wound up selling it. \n\nVivid memory of burning the roof of my mouth in that place. \n\n[NY times review from 1992](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/27/arts/939392.html)\n\n>There are few places better to go for pizza than Patsy's Pizza, just two and a half years old but already part of the Fulton Ferry District firmament. Patsy Grimaldi, 60 years old, who owns Patsy's with his wife, Carol, started working in his uncle's pizzeria in East Harlem when he was 10. That pizzeria, also called Patsy's, was acclaimed for decades for its brick-oven pies. After Mr. Grimaldi's uncle died, he decided to open his own place. The original Patsy's has since been sold and is no longer in the family.\n\n>The new Patsy's, hidden in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, works on the formula of two parts fresh ingredients, one part Frank Sinatra -- or maybe it's the other way around. Photos of the Early Sinatra, photos of the Late Sinatra, and photos, newspaper clippings and posters of all Sinatras in between line the walls, along with stylistic influences from Judy Garland to Lester Young to the McGuire Sisters. Needless to say, there's a jukebox. Don't ask who predominates.\n\n>\"He's a good friend of mine,\" Mr. Grimaldi said. \"He visited my uncle's place many times.\"\n\n>Still, it's the pizza, not the hope of a Sinatra sighting, that draws the crowds. Big, boisterous families, young couples and single men in suits reading newspapers occupy the red-and-white-checked tables. From any vantage point in the brightly lighted dining room, diners can see the pizza bakers in the open kitchen slapping the dough, ladling out fragrant, homemade tomato sauce, sprinkling fresh mozzarella and basil leaves, fennel-laced sausage, slivers of pepperoni and home-roasted peppers. They can watch as pies are shoveled into the big coal-fired brick oven, and removed, still bubbling.\n\n>The pies arrived quickly after ordering, the crust thin and crisp in the center, blackened and blistered around the dense and bready edges. A large eight-piece pie is $12.50, with $2 for each extra topping. Diners who considered themselves two- or three-slice eaters found themselves easily consuming four, simply because the pizza was so delicious.\n\n>You don't expect much besides pizza from a pizzeria, but Patsy's serves a surprisingly good cannoli ($2.50) and a delicious cappuccino ($3.50), stratified layers of steamed milk, espresso and foamed milk clearly visible in the tall glass mugs.\n\n>There's little not to like at Patsy's. Service is swift, friendly and efficient. Beverages even include root beer, the black sheep of the soda family, which is not always invited to the table. Of course, there is that Sinatra fellow, dominating the place like a famous relative who hasn't shown up. Maybe he got stuck with the leftovers.

Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Salt the water and add in macaroni. Stir and cook until Al Dente, about 8-10 minutes. Drain and set aside.\n\n2. While the pasta is cooking, make the avocado sauce by placing the garlic, avocados, lime juice, cilantro, salt and pepper into a food processor or blender. Process until smooth and creamy. Set aside.\n\n3. To make the cheese sauce, place butter in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. When butter is melted, whisk in flour to create a paste. Whisk in milk until smooth. Stir with a wooden spoon until the sauce starts to thicken. Add in Pepper Jack cheese and stir until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy.\n\n4. Place macaroni in a large bowl. Pour the avocado sauce over the macaroni and stir until well coated. Add the cheese sauce and stir until macaroni is coated and creamy. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve warm. Garnish with fresh avocado chunks, if desired.\n\nNote-the lime juice keeps the avocado from browning. The mac and cheese is best eaten the first day, but it is still good the second day. The pasta may turn slightly brown, but not bad. If you want a milder flavor, you can use Monterey Jack or White Cheddar Cheese.", "id": "d4uijgz"}, {"comment": "Huge props for this guy.

However, avocado are climactic fruit (they produce ethylene gas to stimulate abcision and ripening in a cascade... when one goes they all go) and if you put them in a brown paper bag with a banana for a day they will retain a lot of their lost flavor. \n\n3. You may have only had the texas variety of avocados. They have thin, green skins and little flavor in comparison to the Haas avocado. \n\nThere!

I don't think I'll ever like it on its own. I only just started liking guacamole. \n\nPeanut butter tastes like peanuts. Well, it tastes like sweetened peanuts, unless it's sugar free, salt free, all natural kind that you need to mix up before using it (because the oil and peanut butter separates). That just tastes like plain peanuts. What does peanut butter taste like to you? \n\nEdit: Cucumbers mostly taste fine, but a lot of the time they taste overly \"green\" and gross.
