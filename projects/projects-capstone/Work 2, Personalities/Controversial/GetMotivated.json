So this is how it feels.\" It was scary but it still felt...OK somehow, like this is how it's just supposed to go. I prayed and submitted to whatever God deemed for me.\n\nI recovered that night, fought back and now I'm good but it forever changed me. Seeing the very worst that can happen to you caused me to completely reevaluate my life. I love my wife with reckless abandon now. We've been married 20 years and it's still magical when I look at her. I wake up each day fired up to meet it. When I say a prayer of thanks, it comes directly from my heart. God saw fit to give me a bonus round in this life and I'm not going to miss anything or waste a moment of it.\n\nYeah Butters....You know the secret.", "id": "d8m2dre"}, {"comment": "But... you went back to the Carpet Store...

One man's trash is another man's treasure. Please understand this, your perspective is completely valid, but that doesn't mean that opposing perspectives are 'brash', 'canned', or 'ignorant', and it definitely doesn't mean that your conclusions are inherently true. \n\nYou made a lot of blanket statements that you masqueraded as if they were facts. 'There is no light at the end of the tunnel. You do not matter. Nothing matters.' If you are so certain, prove it beyond a reasonable doubt that those statements are true. Argue your case. Show me how it's true. Because from my perspective, these are merely self-defeating BELIEFS that you have created. Please look at whether they help you achieve your goals and live the life you want to live. If they don't, CHANGE THEM. You created them, and you can change them.\n\nSince I asked you to 'prove' it, I'll provide my own proof. \"I think therefore I am\" is 100% true, at least on an individual basis. Everything in existence could be completely fabricated, but you are undeniably, absolutely conscious. If you are conscious, then consciousness 100% exists. You might not know if anyone else is aware, but YOU are, and it's the one absolute and 'original' truth you have. All other truths are 'indirect', because they stem from logic applied to that truth.\n\nSo, what does consciousness do? It observes. It experiences. And it makes decisions by looking for patterns, and ascribes meaning to those patterns. Whether it's a fish that experiences a fast-moving flicker of light and ascribes the meaning of 'prey' in order to hunt, or whether it's a human looking at the world and concluding that 'life is meaningless'. These are all MEANINGS ascribed by *an observer*. If life was ACTUALLY meaningless, you literally would not be conscious, because consciousness *by its nature* constantly creates meaning. Just the act of reading this post is literally you creating and ascribing meaning to a bunch of weird scribbly marks that are, without an observer, completely meaningless. \n\nWe are so used to meaning-creation that we forget we even do it. And you are being arrogant by asserting 'You do not matter' when you don't even KNOW the person, let alone what meaning they may have ascribed to their life, or whether they are even *capable* of ascribing meaning (aka whether they're conscious). It's the same as saying 'You are 100% not conscious, nor have any autonomy, and I chose not to find any meaning in your supposed existence'. In fact, it's *dangerous*, because it fuels the negative thought patterns behind depression and suicide. It is a false belief based on biases that I don't think you're acknowledging your limitations. I believe you deserve more then these lies you're telling yourself.  \n\nYou're free to find the op's sentiment insulting, or to believe that life is meaningless, but that does not make it true. Look carefully at the lies you're telling yourself. Consider whether they are sound beliefs, and how they impact the rest of your life. Please understand that I don't say any of this to tear you down or dismiss anything you're going through. I've been suicidal, I know how true those thoughts can seem. In fact, there are some damn good reasons to come to the conclusions you shared. But I see biases and lies throughout your post, and I believe you deserve to hear the truth.

Time for a wall of text:\n\n-----------------\n\nI sort of agree that there is no such thing as a self, but for an entirely different reason. At a fundamental level, a \"human\" is a bunch of quantum particles (I can jump up to \"molecules\" if that's easier to conceptualize) in a recognizable pattern which have consistent-ish and mostly predictable reactions. To get into this more thoroughly, there is [a great video by Kurzgesagt talking about the physical self and object identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4&feature=youtu.be). The sister video by CPGrey linked at the end is also entertaining and informative, but not as directly relevant. Essentially what I'm getting down to is (and this is extrapolating very slightly from where the video ends) that identifying \"you\" on an objective level isn't just hard, it's impossible. So I deduce to the idea that, objectively speaking, \"you\" don't (doesn't?) exist.\n\nNot in the sense that you're actually part of the universe, or an expression of something else, or a commonality of man, or whatever. You just don't exist. You're not real. There objectively does not exist such a thing as people.\n\nThis idea I take to be simultaneously true and useless. The knowledge that I don't exist does not dissuade the perception that I exist or the subjective truth that \"I think therefore I am\", because even if objectively I don't think and am not, I don't perceive things that way, so subjectively I must exist. It's not a stretch from there to perceive or subjectively deduce that other people are equally real as I am, which is to say subjectively real, at least to themselves if not also transitively real to me.\n\nAs such, objective reality must be in part discarded in favor of subjective reality because frankly objective reality if taken purely cannot guide my actions. Objectively, not only do I not exist, but none of the things I do have any grand meaning other than the alteration of specific energy states (since matter and space are forms of energy, yadda yadda the details are irrelevant). Basically, the objective view of my life and what to do with it amounts to \"meh, whatever\" which is clearly unhelpful. Therefore if I intend to live, I must adopt at least some elements of subjective reality, at least enough to assume that I exist and that this existence holds meaning.\n\nThis train of thought goes on further, but this should be enough to work with.\n\n------------\n\nNow to get back to your comment.\n\nAs you may have gathered, I do not agree with the spiritual viewpoint that I am the universe experiencing the universe, in part or otherwise. Under most definitions of \"ego\", I can agree that taking DarkTussin's passages to their extreme interpretation would reduce and/or suppress the ego. I do not agree that this is a universally good thing that should be taken to its maximal extreme. I might not even agree that it should be done except under specific extenuating circumstances. I definitely do not agree that being oneself \"runs the world\", at least insofar as I cannot understand what \"runs the world\" even means. I'm certain objective reality would continue without me and/or as many other humans up to and including all of them.\n\nThe ego is important, and is literally (subjectively) who you are. Getting rid of it completely is to kill the self. Given that I am required to subjectively hold the self to be an extant thing if I wish to subjectively exist, removing the ego entirely is a cessation of existence and therefore death (in this case also literal, if not physical, suicide).\n\nNow this is where things get tricky. I can't say that death is bad without defining a frame of reference. From the objective frame, death is obviously irrelevant, as you weren't alive to begin with and therefore can't die. From a subjective frame (there are infinite subjective frames btw) I would need to hold an assumption that logically derives to death being bad. I can't express a desire to live or a desire to not die because from the subjective frame of reference you provided those desires should be eschewed and are therefore invalid as the basis of reasoning. The simplest is just to declare that death is bad, and the other obvious answer is to declare that continuing to exist should be striven for. In a subjective frame (i.e. philosophy) that doesn't hold an idea like one of those, death is acceptable or even desirable, and so the committing suicide or allowing death to happen is likewise acceptable or desirable. It's really hard to dissuade that notion without [begging the question / circular reasoning](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/begging-the-question.html).\n\nTo resolve this, I am going to assert that Life (as defined as a perpetuation of existence) is Good (which is unavoidably synonymous with \"desirable\") and Death (as defined as a cessation of existence) is Bad (undesirable) and hope you can agree with that assumption and its validity. Then, from the subjective viewpoint that holds these two assumptions, I should not choose to totally suppress my ego because that is Suicide/Death and Death is Bad.\n\n------------\n\nI actually argue in favor of expanding the ego as far as possible, since the ego is the self and I want to be myself as much as I can (there's a lot of assumptions in that belief though, and I don't have full faith in some of them). When most people hear that, I expect them to leap to conclusions like assuming I am advocating pure emotional selfishness with no control. This is not the case. I *am* arguing for, perhaps not total but mostly complete, emotional *experience*; feeling what you feel to the fullest extent. I am arguing for selfishness in way, but under the belief that altruism is a form of selfishness (that's another explanation at least equally long so I'm not going to go into that right now) and therefore you're not really being \"selfish\" in the negative connotation form of the word at all.", "id": "d6507yy"}, {"comment": "So don't lose yourself in emotions but experience everything on the most emotional level you can even if it means doing things people claim you are selfish and mean for doing, do it in the spirit of trying to experience everything at least once, while being careful not to become a slave to our actual selfish desires? \n\nHad to stop reading that multiple times because i am at work.

If actually pressed to make a decision I'd probably choose the selfish route. There are limits though, especially involving anything I perceive as harmful to others, which via my general belief in avoiding self-harm by not harming others, needs to be much more strongly motivated.\n\nFor extreme example, if I was being attacked by a psycho killer, I'd murder them without consideration since I could \"get away with it\" in the sense that no social repercussion will come back to harm me because self-defense is understood as a situation permitting harm. I'm not sure real-me in that situation would truly avoid hesitation, but I'm certainly not gonna spare the life of someone trying to kill me for life's own sake.\n\nEDIT: I suppose I should supply a *non*-extreme example too. Here's a good one: If I see an idea I disagree with strongly on reddit that I think is harmful to perpetuate, I will ignore certain forms of negative repercussion in the form of people harassing me and make a post about it; a selfish decision despite possible and even probable \"harm\", albeit minor (and yet also an altruistic one, since my aim is to shape the discussion space and improve the quality of discourse, but note that I do so for selfish reasons and therefore it is selfish).", "id": "d652rjx"}, {"comment": "Not to say we share all the same beliefs, but I feel like we think very similarly in regard to the topic at hand.

You definitely expressed my thoughts in a very condensed form I had not yet reached myself, it was very elucidating.", "id": "d653f3w"}, {"comment": "That, to me, is a slightly concerning perspective on altruism. If your subjective experience is subjectively meaningful, and you grant that others' subjective experiences are likewise subjectively meaningful, then how can they be any less important for you to work for? That interpretation of the Golden Rule - do good things so that others will do good things to you - is not what is usually meant by those who perpetuate it, because obviously that is a flawed strategy. Rather, the spirit of it is that you are a person and another is a person, and whether one person does good for another, or the second does good for the first, that is - from an impartial perspective - a good thing. Thus, treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself.", "id": "d6536lf"}, {"comment": "I don't think the distinction is as large as you make it out to be when extrapolated fully, but there are important differences. Definitely though this is not the \"intended\" meaning of the original Golden Rule. However, I argue that it is the original Golden Rule which is flawed, and my \"selfish altruism\" which corrects that flaw.\n\nTo begin with, you mention that under subjective reality I should respect others as much as I respect myself. This seems like a reasonable assumption, but it breaks down in extreme cases. My \"extreme example\" from above is a good example. When valuing my life against the life of someone else who means me harm, those lives *don't* have equal value; I value my life more. This isn't necessarily to say that the lives of others don't matter, but it says minimally that my life is at least slightly more important to me than the lives of other people. I hold that much to be true. I haven't explored much further down that vein, be we can go that way if you like.\n\nSo, how does \"selfish altruism\" differ from a true \"Golden Rule\"? Primarily the distinction I see is that selfish altruism keeps in mind that one should only inconvenience oneself to help others as much as you can expect to gain back. This seems like a horribly jaded view, until you realize what it is preventing. If I help others to the *exclusion* of helping myself (i.e. take \"Golden Rule\" altruism all the way to the extreme), I can potentially get back to one of the situations where I starve to death, because I am so busy providing for others I fail to take basic care of myself. In other words, there has to be a limit.\n\nThe principle of always putting the self first seemingly paradoxically provides better for others, because you are more able to perform altruistic action when you are personally better-off. For another extreme example, take airplane cabin decompression. When an airplane cabin depressurizes, you have about five or ten seconds before deoxygenation prevents your ability to think properly. [A good example of where that leads is here - pay attention to when they tell him to put his mask back on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUfF2MTnqAw). If you put on your own mask, you get oxygen back and can think clearly, and can then put the mask of others on and save them as well. If you put someone else's mask on first, you can lose the ability to think clearly enough to save yourself and risk suffocation if the other person doesn't/can't save you (for example a small child). Moreover, if you put your own mask on first, you can potentially save multiple other people. In this case, the *selfish answer is also more altruistic*, because not only do you ensure your own life, but you empower yourself to save an arbitrary number of other lives.\n\nIn a more everyday example, something as simple as getting myself a job gives me a lot of disposable income which I can put to altruistic use, like donating to Patreons, and even if I'm doing that for selfish reasons (donor rewards!) the target of my altruism still benefits.\n\nSo while I can respect the sentiment behind the Golden Rule - taking (selfish) joy in helping others - I also reason that in order to maximize that selfish joy and the altruistic benefits I deliver I must behave selfishly to optimally accomplish this to the best of my ability.\n\n**EDIT:** Forgot to link the video!\n\n**EDIT2:** I need to make an implication in there more explicit. I'm counting \"satisfying empathetic desire to help others\" as a selfish desire and a positive selfish benefit. I realized that's not a clear/obvious assumption to make if you don't know me, so there you go, FWIW.", "id": "d653vqn"}, {"comment": "DarkTussian had some good words. Allow me to expand.\n\nFirst of all, you're not suppressing emotions. In fact, it's far more freeing because you allow emotions to happen to you when they do. You say, \"oh, here is fear\" \"oh, here is anger\" \"oh, here is lust.\" The difference is that you *don't react* to it. You wait for the emotion to be over, and then you *choose* to do something.\n\nYou can have attraction to someone, but if you decide to hang out/date/marry that person, you don't do it because that person gives you happiness (because you already have it), or because you want their love (because you don't need it). You do it simply because you decided that that is what you wanted to have in your life.\n\nPeople who have mastery of this concept can absolutely be strong, aggressive, decisive, and passionate, but they only do it when that is the action that they choose, not when their emotions tell them to do it.\n\nYou will obviously still have ideas, dreams, or goals.

I keep trying to tell my bro how being yourself is the absolute coolest, but he has no idea what that means yet.\nSharing a personal story and being openly proud of it is not equivalent to being self-absorbed or pretentious- It's being vulnerable, something that should be commended rather than ridiculed- in teenage guys especially.

You can't feel fulfilled going to work, if you have a desire to rather be playing video games.\n\n\"This is what [The first Buddha] discovered: there is an end to suffering; it can happen to anybody, anywhere, here and now; and the key to ending all suffering is to remove all desire, ill will and ignorance.\"\nhttp://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s05.htm\n", "id": "d74ueza"}, {"comment": "Nah, that comment is bullshit.

During the Season of Retreat when all the monks returned to the monastery, two novices had to do all the cooking and wash the dishes for sometimes well over one hundred monks.\n\nThere was no soap. We had only ashes, rice husks, and coconut husks, and that was all. Cleaning such a high stack of bowls was a chore, especially during the winter when the water was freezing cold. Then you had to heat up a big pot of water before you could do any scrubbing.\n\nNowadays one stands in a kitchen equipped with liquid soap, special scrubpads, and even running hot water which makes it all the more agreeable. It is easier to enjoy washing the dishes now. Anyone can wash them in a hurry, then sit down and enjoy a cup of tea afterwards. I can see a machine for washing clothes, although I wash my own things out by hand, but a dishwashing machine is going just a little too far!\n\nWhile washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes, which means that while washing the dishes one should be completely aware of the fact that one is washing the dishes.\n \nAt first glance, that might seem a little silly: why put so much stress on a simple thing? But that\u2019s precisely the point. The fact that I am standing there and washing these bowls is a wondrous reality. I\u2019m being completely myself, following my breath, conscious of my presence and conscious of my thoughts and actions. There\u2019s no way I can be tossed around mindlessly like a bottle slapped here and there on the waves.\n \nThe cup in your hands\n. . . There are two ways to wash the dishes. The first is to wash the dishes in order to have clean dishes and the second is to wash the dishes in order to wash the dishes. . . .\nIf while washing the dishes, we think only of the cup of tea that awaits us, thus hurrying to get the dishes out of the way as if they were a nuisance, then we are not \u201cwashing the dishes to wash the dishes.\u201d What\u2019s more, we are not alive during the time we are washing the dishes.\n\nIn fact we are completely incapable of realizing the miracle of life while standing at the sink. If we can\u2019t wash the dishes, the chances are we won\u2019t be able to drink our tea either. While drinking the cup of tea, we will only be thinking of other things, barely aware of the cup in our hands. Thus we are sucked away into the future \u2013 and we are incapable of actually living one minute of life.\n\n", "id": "d753x8x"}, {"comment": "I shoveled shit.

It was a plastic tank that had already been sucked empty by the honey bucket guy, so we sawzalled the top off and my friend jumped in to cut the rest of it into pieces so we could remove it. It smelled worse than ever, and the walls were stilled lined with sewage.

Forget status, forget stuff, forget all of the shit that comes with money and think about freedom. If you have more money then the odds are (in America, at least) you will have more freedom.

No. HOWEVER, an understanding of how you can live your life the way you want to BECAUSE of money enabling you.... that's the sort of thing I keep in mind. \n\nDifferent things make different people happy.

This depression can not be fought off simply by thinking positive thoughts because the brain isn't producing the chemicals to feel happiness properly. The hopeless spiral of negativity isn't sparkled by a tragic event, it's just always there. Lurking beneath the surface, the depressive mentality can be triggered by anything.

I can almost, for a split second, feel how small we really are in the scheme of things.", "id": "d2j07bi"}, {"comment": "We really are horribly insignificant. Within just our own Galaxy were an average sized rock with some water on it. Orbiting a medium sized sun that in all actuality is nothing special at all compared to its brothers and sisters out in the cosmos. The sun the thing that gives us everything we've ever needed or wanted. is just one insignificant star out of hundreds of trillions within its galaxy. Even within its own star cluster within that vast galaxy it is just average and in all points, insignificant.\n\n\n Beyond that our own galaxy is just an average spiral glaxy surrounded by billions if not trillions to possibly infinite more galaxies. Some much more fantastical than we could possibly ever hope. And those galaxies are all part of galaxy clusters that make up the ever expanding universe to which we know no end because we can't even see outside of our own possibly insignificantly tiny bubble know as the observable universe. \n\n\nAnd to think, if the Fermi paradox is true. Then we just like many other civilizations on distant worlds that might have come before, will probably never even get past our own solar system, which is nothing but a drop in the cosmic ocean of our own galaxy.\n\n\n There may never have been a civilization in all the universe that could break past the Fermi paradox's great filter, and if they did they obviously have either not found us or consider us so insignificant that they can't be bothered with us.\n\n\n If we can't pass the foreseeable \"Great Filter\" within the Fermi paradox, then were fucked no matter what as a civilization. \n\n\nWe could just be another pointless little blip on the radar that other civilizations are waiting to see how close it can come before it's worth taking note of. Or we might just be on some aliens tv right now being viewed as a nature documentary.\n\n\n Who knows, if we are the only life out there, and we get passed the great filter, only to discover were alone, what then? What is left?\n\n\n In the grand scheme of things the universe just seems too big and unpredictable for one generation to tackle, maybe even too big for one species alone to tackle. So most of us are content with living our lives the best we can with that small fraction of a fraction of an impossible decimal point of time we have in this otherwise endless reality. Because until we can break past the possibly unknowable things that constrain us to this planet alone, we can't even hope to truly explore and inhabit the endless cosmos around us. \n\nIts truly a terrifyingly daunting idea to try to process. So much so that it almost makes me feel blissful and calm to think about it. Because no matter how much we try, right now at our level, we have no true way to comprehend the infinite possibilities out there in the possibly endless vacuum of space. Our own logic and theories of everything we know could be shattered in an instant if we could just break past that first true threshold and begin to truly understand the universe we live in. We may never get there. But humanity is persistent. Even if we don't make it we'll claw our way as close as we can. Hell if anything truly is possible than maybe tomorrow it'll all happen in an instant. Its truly impossible to know. \n\n[if you really wanna feel confused and small and scared of the future of everything and everyone go read through this, the Fermi paradox And the great filter are way scarier and more amazing than anything else I've ever read about in theoretical science](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)\n\nAlso Sagans blue dot speech is so goddamn humbling and inspiring. It makes you truly reflect on your own significance or lack there of. The man makes a mind think that the big picture is sometimes to big and we need to focus on ourselves and each other before we focus on what's out there. I wish he was alive today, hell he died just a year after I was born. To think while I was shitting my pants he was pondering the mysteries of the universe, and changing people's perspectives on reality, the world, and even the universe around them. It's hard to think that I will or could ever be as good a use of this precious thing called life that he was and so many before him were.\n\n\n To think of all the great minds, all the great people that ever were, from the first hominid to use tools and harness fire, to Stephen Hawking. From the first homosapiens to unite a tribe, to Justinian The Great of Constantinople or dreamed of uniting the known world under one banner, and even came closest of all since its fall, to reuniting the Roman Empire. It's hard to imagine that so many billions of other lives have come and gone without making even a slight sound to let you know they were there.\n\n\n Were insignificant. But even greatness can be found every so often within that insignificance. And maybe we just have to hope that enough can be found one day to make us truly significant in the grand scheme of it all.

We can now look off into infinity and not be deterred, but rather be motivated by trying to get there. \n\nWe are explorers by nature. I believe it is hardwired into our DNA, and the accomplishments of Apollo explorers, like Edgar Mitchell who I quoted above, or the dude who is crackin' off the tight salute to the world in the photo OP posted (Apollo 16 Commander John Young) - they all played a huge role in helping to pave our path to the Heavens. They are heroes all, and we can't let the risks they took for humanity go to waste.

The answer to that question is something you are very passionate about, so go and pursue it.

This varies from person to person, so only you can truly discover it, others can only give you hints, so here are some of my hints (thoughts that have personally helped me): \n\n* Find a way to be positive most of the time about yourself and about the thing you want to achieve: this might sound very clich\u00e9, but it is a VERY powerful idea, Why?, because whenever you have a positive mindset you feel better, this includes feeling motivated, willing to do whatever it takes, feeling overall happier, and many more great feelings, these feelings will then help actually going through the process, this process WILL be difficult (if you are trying to do something worthy), this process WILL have setbacks and obstacles, but by having a way to be positive again and again about the thing you are doing you will find it easier to persist. \n\n* Persistence outlasts failure: If you keep on learning, keep on improving, keep on doing, you will get where you want. If other people have achieved it then you have proof that its completely doable and that you can get there. If nobody has achieved it then congrats you can be the first one to ever achieve it, if you are determined then knowing that fact should be encouraging enough.\n\n* In life, the more you put into anything, the more you get out of it: it is important to have this in your mind, specially when you are starting out something because it might feel like you are not getting much progress, but be sure that from time to time it is normal to feel like that (one of those times frequently being the beginning of something), so do not be discouraged, if you are putting effort into it, then you ARE getting something out of it, even if you don\u2019t see any results (you are at least learning or getting experience, which in turn will make you better, even if just slightly). \n\n* Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day. - Jim Rohn\n\nI can not encourage enough the idea of being positive about what you do, there are infinite ways of doing this. For example: I am a programmer, when I am programming a boring and somewhat tedious part of a project (that has to be done anyways), I think about how nicely structured my code is being written and how that nice structure helps me find specific parts of the code easier and how that will make me more productive when I have to come back to read or modify that code. As you can see in that case (when I am writing boring parts of a project) its not that I am doing the most exciting thing ever, however I find a way to be positive about it and that greatly helps me persist.

The one thing, that all native speakers point out when they hear me speak, is the lack of an accent, it's almost as if I was born there. I've found that, if you try to learn an accent while learning the language, you progress much faster.\n\nI have a really posh English accent (except when I'm angry, then I become Northern :D), even though I am Latvian and have never lived in England or even come in contact with English people up until very recently. The accent helped me learn certain words just from the context of sentences and conversations much more easily. Also it improves spelling by a lot as you can sometimes hear how a word is spelt (the British way of spelling ''spelled'') wrong when you read it in the ''right'' accent. \n\nAccents are very important as they leave an impression on the person you're talking to. You're natural accent will very, very rarely be judged and people will be happy that you are making an effort to learn their language. The most correct accent (without slang, shortening of words, emphasis in unusual places) is usually met with respect and gives you confidence. An attempt at a correct accent, but failing in such a way that you seem like you're mocking them (happens to me when I try any of the Australian, Scottish or American accents) is usually not received too well haha, but don't let that stop you from practicing alone or with friends. When you learn the correct accent, you can switch them around based on your situation. You could use your natural one and pretend to be worse at the language than you really are in situations where people are bugging you, trying to sell you something, asking too many questions and you want them to go away (done this a few times and it works like a charm, even on the police) or one of the native accents to have a very fluent, quick, friendly, comfortable and warm conversation with a native, although I wouldn't suggest using that when talking to another foreigner, who you don't know well and who has trouble with the language. It can make them feel insecure, it definitely has made me feel like that in the past.\n\nTo learn the accents all I did was watch live TV shows, movies, listen to audiobooks, podcasts and repeat what they were saying as best as I can while going at my own pace, not even really following what they are saying, just how they are saying it. I looked stupid and like a lunatic, but it worked and I got the hang of it very quickly, I got the basics down in a couple of weeks actually. If you stumble upon a harder word, just repeat it until you get it right or look up on the internet how to say it (you can find plenty of free pronunciation examples and linguistic guides for most languages using google). Reading aloud slowly and pronouncing every word very clearly, with lots of emphasis on the harder bits helps a lot too.\n\nAlso, never be afraid to ask people how something is pronounced, spelt or what a word means. I, only very recently, after having used English daily for 10+ years, learnt that the word ''Colonel'' is actually pronounced like this: [/\u02c8k\u025c\u02d0.n\u0259l/](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/colonel). I have heard it a lot in my lifetime and knew what it meant, but I thought that the word ''Colonel'' was an entirely different word and that what it actually meant was spelt ''Curnel'' or ''Curonel'' haha. Somehow I had never really seen or had to use it in written for before. I had missed it entirely, only to embarrass myself, by reading it aloud and pronouncing it exactly the way it is written in front of a very important person. But I didn't pretend like it didn't happen, I swallowed my pride, asked, how it is correctly pronounced and what the word meant, and the person was very kind, understanding and friendly, when explaining it to me, people are almost always happy to help with such simple things. Now I know more and will have avoided that from happening again in the future. This has happened to me a lot and it happens to native speakers too, the mistake that most people make is they feel embarrassed, change the subject, pretend like it didn't happen and try to forget about it instead of admitting that their small mistake and learning from it.\n\nJust because you don't yet know all the words, grammatical rules and sentence structure, doesn't mean you should ignore proper pronunciation and not do your best to speak using a nice sounding and correct accent. You should learn and practice all of those things at the same time. It is much easier to learn everything correctly once, than to try to fix/improve certain areas, once you have gotten good/mastered the others. You don't have to actually use a native accent in conversation, if you aren't feeling confident about it, just try to use it in private. For 8 out of the 10+ years I have been able to speak fluent English, I actually used a weird Lativan/Indian sounding accent that felt much more comfortable and natural to me, but without knowing the accent, thinking in it, practicing it in private and eventually using it in conversations, I wouldn't be nearly as confident with my English and I wouldn't know nearly as much. I can honestly say that using a proper, correct native accent in private has helped me in a lot of ways, when learning to understand, write and speak new language. I really suggest you give it a go for a month or two, just try to pronounce words and sentences the way the natives do and you will see a lot of improvement in every area :)\n\n(There are probably quite a few grammatical or style mistakes in this comment, don't mind them, It's quite late, I've had too much coffee and I have a weird way to construct sentences, place commas, words even in my own language, because the languages I know get mixed up in my head. Also, there probably are some nouns capitalised that shouldn't be, that's the German seeping through haha. Please point out any mistakes I've made.

I went on to also thru-hike the PCT as well (it is even more beautiful).  Hopefully I'll catch you as you come through VT (I have some trail magic set out just across the border from Hanover).\n\nHere is what I wrote in a similar thread a few days ago for reference:\n\nYep...it's never too late. After a rather mundane existence....I quit everything, took a huge risk, went back to zero, and thru-hiked the AT in 2007. I was tired of saying I would some day.  Afterward the hike, I also finally made the decision to go back to graduate school at 30 years old, after having previously worked that stable job for 7 years and having a mortgage and having \u201csettled down\u201d. I was definitely the old guy in my program. It was weird seeing the 22 year-old students, fresh out of undergrad, starting the same graduate program as me. It was hard not to think that they really had no clue what it was like living outside of school. I did my undergrad in engineering (electrical/computer) and worked for those 7 years in in that role after I graduated. I was never truly happy though, and honestly felt like Dilbert after slowly moving away from a technical role and into more project management roles. I started taking evening classes at a community college and fell in love with the geosciences again. I eventually took the GRE's and applied to graduate school for Geoscience (specifically glaciology and paleoclimatology) and was accepted! I decided to pursue a masters degree first as I thought jumping straight into a PhD was a bit ambitious. Additionally, it had been many years since I studied the fundamentals of science, and coming from an engineering undergraduate schooling, I had to somewhat \"relearn\" the concepts of the scientific method. In a sense, I had to re-remember what it means to be a scientist rather than an engineer. I knew it would add a few years on, but it was the right move. After 2.5 years, I finished the masters, took the summer off to hike the PCT (which was amazing) and then continued on to the PhD program at the same university. I'm happy to say that I defended and graduated last year. Now I\u2019m working in a new fantastic post-doc as well...and I've never been happier! Despite it taking 7 years total from the time I made the decision to quit my stable, and rather high-paying job, I don't regret my decisions at all! I no longer sit in a cubicle. In additions to the hikes, I\u2019ve even spent 6 field seasons working in remote parts of Antarctica, and will deploy this year for my 7th. So glad I finally had the courage to drop everything and start over again. TLDR: It\u2019s never too late my friends.\n\nGood luck to you!\n-lakewood, AT 2007"], [16, "I am in the middle of my own battle now too. 28 yrs old, with a stable job and a good amount of savings but...

I have spent most of my endeavors trying to stay inside my comfort zone but by now I have lost everything that I consider familliar, and have been struggling to find a way back to my shell.\n\nBut I know there's no more going back.

I have no job, no friends, no girlfriend and, most importantly, no idea what I want to become. I'm 25. I fear that through a lack of choice, I've become a loser. The reason I've been 6 years doing nothing that adds value to my employability or social capital is quite severe bullying during high-school and the resulting avoidant personality disorder (and no, sadly I did not diagnose myself on that). I've only ever had 2 friends in my life and the second turned out to be a bully in disguise. That gave me huge trust issues with people.\n\nThese last couple of months have been horrible. Pretty much every night I've been feeling this horrible sense of impending doom. It doesn't get into the full-blown hyperventilating of a panic attack, but it's pretty close.\n\nI am completely reliant on my parents, both financially and emotionally. I feel incredibly guilty and insecure for not being able to support myself and whenever I hear news about classmates or cousins around my age, how they've graduated, have girlfriends, successful businesses, etc. I feel broken.\n\nAlmost every night (my \"bedtime\" is 6am) I struggle to go to sleep and end up spending an hour or two just trying to come up with the best way to get myself out of this situation, but I still don't have a plan that gives me hope. Even if I had a great job, great friends and a loving girlfriend tomorrow, I still can't imagine myself being \"happy\" and being able to enjoy the ride with it's ups and downs. I pretty much feel like a dingy out at sea during a storm.\n\nTalking about backpacking, last week a I took my dog on an overnight backpacking trip. The weather was perfect, the place and the wildlife was great, the skies were full of stars. But I just couldn't relax and I spent most of the time just thinking and feeling that sense of impending doom. The last couple of years I haven't been able to disconnect and relax. Not having a job or any educational responsibilities is absolute hell because without work time, there is no play time, just time. I never feel like I deserve a break... I can't catch a break. A Friday evening feels indistinguishable from a Sunday evening. It's like a flat rollercoaster; never have to work up, but also no fall to enjoy. I think I'd be happier cleaning toilets, yet I don't go looking for the job because I'm scared of feeling \"Is this it for the rest of my life?\". It's somewhat ironic that I'm one step under \"toilet cleaner\": NEET.\n\nI think of suicide, but there is 0% risk as long as my dog lives. I really love him.\n\nAnyway... at least I got gilded this month.\n\nPS: Intellectually I understand that most people my age go through their fair share of uncertainty, anxiety, depression and loneliness.

I was pretty inspired by your story, but then I found out what your business is about, and that really killed it for me. As someone who has dealt with chronic depression and anxiety for well over a decade as well as ulcerative colitis, I was interest in how you had finally succeeded, but I found your website to be a farce. When I was younger, I tried the Paleo diet, I sourced the best quality meat and fish I could find. I spent thousands on nutritional supplements, and I was fooled by people like you into believing that these had any value whatsoever. None of these things helped me, except through placebo for a time. Your website reminded me of how gullible I had been.\n\nWhat helped me the most, and I am not the only one in this, is adopting a plant-based diet, supplemented with nothing but moderate exercise. This has given me my life back. I was so impressed and changed by this that I spent hundreds of hours studying nutrition, trying to understand how that could be possible. From what I learned, I know for a fact - and not just from experience - that your nutrition advice is mediocre at best, dangerous at worse.\n\nI am not an expert on fitness so I didn't look at that section, but my initial thought was that if you're selling people short when it comes to nutrition advice (which is *huge*), then you probably are in those other areas that you claim to be an expert in. I hope once you're done on your journey, which is in itself inspiring, you'll re-evaluate your business and the ethical side of your life, because it certainly fails to inspire."], [3, "It's astounding how similar your story is to my own.  I'm 29 as well and the same kind of thing happened about a decade ago for me - though on my end it had started earlier, in highschool, and reached a head by then, and I wasn't even as 'successful' as you were back then, basically going from highschool straight into the depressive state with nothing under my belt.  If I tried to name all the things I tried and that didn't work, the exercises, medications, therapies, self-help schemes, rehab clinics, etc. I'd be here all night.  The fact of the matter is very much like what you said -- for some of us, it just simply takes time, and a lot of pain, and that's really it.  Like you said, at first it was nightmarish, hellish, almost impossible to even stay alive as I felt I failed everything and had no chance to ever make up for it, but with every difficulty, every depressive episode, every bout with anxiety, I've become bit by bit, tiny step by tiny step, stronger, more confident, more resilient, and more wise.  Now, so long after \"most people\" start, here I am finally beginning college next month, after finally getting my SAT's done a few months back, and doing so many other small things for my life, which get easier as each day goes by.\n\nI'm very happy to hear that certain plans or supplements or medications or therapies etc. work for other people, but for guys like me and you, and probably many other people out there, it just takes time and an ever-increasing sense of strength on the inside.

Do something. Start now. You didn't mention wife & kids, so that makes things far easier. You're miserable. You should be able to wake up every day and think \"oh boy, what do I get to do today?\". \n\nI've been in the same boat. Abusive parents that left me overcompensating for un-faced feelings of inadequacy (when your mother beats the shit out of you almost daily when you're like 6 or 8, with whatever brutal shit comes to hand - vinyl hot wheels tracks being a fave - it sticks with ya). But all the shit I learned to do to \"seem\" like something better... I got to keep those things when I woke up and looked deeper. My life is far from perfect, money can be tough, but I created a career (self employed) doing creative things that interest me and every morning is, to some extent - \"what cool shit do I *get to do* today\"? By \"get to do\", I sort of mean \"what's the day going to bring, which of the tools I've learned (cameras, video, photoshop, design, even mechanical stuff) will I make something cool with? What kindred-spirit creative people will I work with? What people will I help with their dreams and (business, generally) goals?\n\nDownsize. Spend some quiet time imagining your dreams. Not lazy-ass dreams of sitting on a beach drinking beer, but cool-ass dreams - hiking the trail, climbing a mountain, learning to do some productive thing you enjoy that society values (IE, is billable!!!) and allows you to be of service. Not necessarily monk-like altruistic service, but *valued* service (in my case, I help small businesses grow and look like bigger businesses) that helps others and they'll pay for. Could be building furniture or could be painting masterpieces or helping create profitability and stability. Whatcha got in you?\n\nRead up, research, study - MAKE A ROUGH PLAN. THINK about the plan, the steps, what you need to learn or obtain - you'll be visualizing a new life - which is actually *rehearsing your new life* and getting comfortable with the image of you *in this new life*. I can't stress this enough - *visualize yourself taking the steps - get used to the idea of you in a new place*.\n\nDo everything you can to find yourself suddenly *living within that dream*. Maybe for you it will be the first step on the trail, or the last. Maybe it will be your first day doing work that's rewarding and exciting to you.\n\nAnd *don't stop doing that*, ever. Example - I had to road-trip it through Texas to shoot a video for a big master-planned development. I found that I am drawn to ruins, wrecked structures wrapped in vines, scraggly forests, old wooden rail bridges. I was musing \"wouldn't it be fun to grab a singer and a makeup artist, load the truck with gear and a picnic lunch, and shoot a cool music video, seat of my pants?\" 60 days later I had google-earthed and satellited and scheduled and mapped, and there we were, in front of some ruined water tanks, with a super-legit beautiful singer-songwriter (that I consider my sister-from-another-mother) and a hilarious cute-babe talented stylist, shooting cool images with groovy lens flares from the sun and beauty beauty beauty. Probably \"spent\" two hundred bucks on the whole thing, didn't do it for money... did it to do it.\n\n*I will remember that day forever.*\n\nFor a few hours, I was standing in some cool place thinking \"*I did it*. And I'm having a blast\". And I get that feeling a lot, big or small. It takes work, but the work seems like nothing when you get there.\n\nStart thinking. Make your plan. Allow for changes. Allow for luck, good and bad. And allow for the fact that the universe seems to open up to people that function this way.

I was definitely the old guy in my program. It was weird seeing the 22 year-old students, fresh out of undergrad, starting the same graduate program as me. It was hard not to think that they really had no clue what it was like living outside of school. I did my undergrad in engineering (electrical/computer) and worked for those 7 years in in that role after I graduated. I was never truly happy though, and honestly felt like Dilbert after slowly moving away from a technical role and into more project management roles. I started taking evening classes at a community college and fell in love with the geosciences again. I eventually took the GRE's and applied to graduate school for Geoscience (specifically glaciology and paleoclimatology) and was accepted! I decided to pursue a masters degree first as I thought jumping straight into a PhD was a bit ambitious. Additionally, it had been many years since I studied the fundamentals of science, and coming from an engineering undergraduate schooling, I had to somewhat \"relearn\" the concepts of the scientific method. In a sense, I had to re-remember what it means to be a scientist rather than an engineer. I knew it would add a few years on, but it was the right move. After 2.5 years, I finished the masters, took the summer off to hike the PCT (which was amazing) and then continued on to the PhD program at the same university. I'm happy to say that I defended and graduated last year. Now I\u2019m working in a new fantastic post-doc as well...and I've never been happier! Despite it taking 7 years total from the time I made the decision to quit my stable, and rather high-paying job, I don't regret my decisions at all! I no longer sit in a cubicle. In additions to the hikes, I\u2019ve even spent 6 field seasons working in remote parts of Antarctica, and will deploy this year for my 7th. So glad I finally had the courage to drop everything and start over again. TLDR: It\u2019s never too late my friends.\n\nGood luck to you!\n-lakewood, AT 2007", "id": "d6gakua"}, {"comment": "That's awesome!

As you come up from Flagstaff lake, there's a shelter at some falls which are great to take a dip at, but you should try to be at the col campsite in time to watch sunset from the first peak. It is ~ 0.2 miles or less from there to the campsite. The other peak is about ~0.2 miles past the campsite. You can have dinner on one peak, and have breakfast with the sunrise on the next peak with very little effort. The panoramic view from each peak is worth the little effort required.\n\nI could give you plenty of other suggestions and beta, but this post would be even longer than it already is.

I have no job, no friends, no girlfriend and, most importantly, no idea what I want to become. I'm 25. I fear that through a lack of choice, I've become a loser. The reason I've been 6 years doing nothing that adds value to my employability or social capital is quite severe bullying during high-school and the resulting avoidant personality disorder (and no, sadly I did not diagnose myself on that). I've only ever had 2 friends in my life and the second turned out to be a bully in disguise. That gave me huge trust issues with people.\n\nThese last couple of months have been horrible. Pretty much every night I've been feeling this horrible sense of impending doom. It doesn't get into the full-blown hyperventilating of a panic attack, but it's pretty close.\n\nI am completely reliant on my parents, both financially and emotionally. I feel incredibly guilty and insecure for not being able to support myself and whenever I hear news about classmates or cousins around my age, how they've graduated, have girlfriends, successful businesses, etc. I feel broken.\n\nAlmost every night (my \"bedtime\" is 6am) I struggle to go to sleep and end up spending an hour or two just trying to come up with the best way to get myself out of this situation, but I still don't have a plan that gives me hope. Even if I had a great job, great friends and a loving girlfriend tomorrow, I still can't imagine myself being \"happy\" and being able to enjoy the ride with it's ups and downs. I pretty much feel like a dingy out at sea during a storm.\n\nTalking about backpacking, last week a I took my dog on an overnight backpacking trip. The weather was perfect, the place and the wildlife was great, the skies were full of stars. But I just couldn't relax and I spent most of the time just thinking and feeling that sense of impending doom. The last couple of years I haven't been able to disconnect and relax. Not having a job or any educational responsibilities is absolute hell because without work time, there is no play time, just time. I never feel like I deserve a break... I can't catch a break. A Friday evening feels indistinguishable from a Sunday evening. It's like a flat rollercoaster; never have to work up, but also no fall to enjoy. I think I'd be happier cleaning toilets, yet I don't go looking for the job because I'm scared of feeling \"Is this it for the rest of my life?\". It's somewhat ironic that I'm one step under \"toilet cleaner\": NEET.\n\nI think of suicide, but there is 0% risk as long as my dog lives. I really love him.\n\nAnyway... at least I got gilded this month.\n\nPS: Intellectually I understand that most people my age go through their fair share of uncertainty, anxiety, depression and loneliness.

I was pretty inspired by your story, but then I found out what your business is about, and that really killed it for me. As someone who has dealt with chronic depression and anxiety for well over a decade as well as ulcerative colitis, I was interest in how you had finally succeeded, but I found your website to be a farce. When I was younger, I tried the Paleo diet, I sourced the best quality meat and fish I could find. I spent thousands on nutritional supplements, and I was fooled by people like you into believing that these had any value whatsoever. None of these things helped me, except through placebo for a time. Your website reminded me of how gullible I had been.\n\nWhat helped me the most, and I am not the only one in this, is adopting a plant-based diet, supplemented with nothing but moderate exercise. This has given me my life back. I was so impressed and changed by this that I spent hundreds of hours studying nutrition, trying to understand how that could be possible. From what I learned, I know for a fact - and not just from experience - that your nutrition advice is mediocre at best, dangerous at worse.\n\nI am not an expert on fitness so I didn't look at that section, but my initial thought was that if you're selling people short when it comes to nutrition advice (which is *huge*), then you probably are in those other areas that you claim to be an expert in.

If I tried to name all the things I tried and that didn't work, the exercises, medications, therapies, self-help schemes, rehab clinics, etc. I'd be here all night.  The fact of the matter is very much like what you said -- for some of us, it just simply takes time, and a lot of pain, and that's really it.  Like you said, at first it was nightmarish, hellish, almost impossible to even stay alive as I felt I failed everything and had no chance to ever make up for it, but with every difficulty, every depressive episode, every bout with anxiety, I've become bit by bit, tiny step by tiny step, stronger, more confident, more resilient, and more wise.  Now, so long after \"most people\" start, here I am finally beginning college next month, after finally getting my SAT's done a few months back, and doing so many other small things for my life, which get easier as each day goes by.\n\nI'm very happy to hear that certain plans or supplements or medications or therapies etc. work for other people, but for guys like me and you, and probably many other people out there, it just takes time and an ever-increasing sense of strength on the inside.

Espousing unfairness as the justification and posing the question \"what are you going to do about it\" or some variant is fine for decisive action planning (e.g having your hand caught under a rock), but for long term and large groups we must use better constructs like fairness to try to form an autonomous form of help and insurance.

We like to think of ourselves as good, and we're better at thinking it than we are at being it.\n\nThis creates a situation where responsibility is the enemy. If we do something noticeably \"unfair\" to someone, our awareness of it is likely unpleasant, and our options are: make it right, make it go away, make it justified. The first option (apologize and make reparations) is uncomfortable and might cost us something; the second (sweep it under the rug and assume they didn't actually lose much) is convenient and easy and covers a multitude of small things, and the third (convince ourselves they're an asshole/idiot/enemy who deserved it) is solid, satisfactory and can justify further \"unfairness\" of greater magnitude, up to and including actual malice.\n\nWe see the three options at play in society at large: the impetus to fix things seen as unfair, the inertia of the way things are due to people not finding it worth the effort to fix, and the set-in opposition of people who argue that it's deserved or escapable and thus *is* fair. \n\n(The other problem is that we live in such a resoundingly complex system, with everybody having different ideas of what's fair, different ways of defining fairness (golden rule vs. platinum rule, same vs. equal, your right to swing your fist ends at my nose or at the trigger point of my avoidance reflexes, egalitarianism vs. hierarchy, merit hierarchy vs. seniority hierarchy, et cetera), different senses of harm derived from the same action, different possibilities of harm derived from the same action, differing access to or value of opportunities, and subjective valuation of what's offered, to name only a few issues, that it's near impossible to do much about it. We can point out our observations, define a few concepts, engage in thought experiments like \"would it still be fair if the positions were reversed,\" and otherwise try to increase awareness of how people might fail at fairness or kindness while thinking they're succeeding, but ultimately it's up to each individual to decide what their standards are and how rigorously to uphold them and who to listen to in shaping them.)\n\nOften, indeed, we choose not to, and often we tie ourselves into knots in order to call it something else.

This may be factually true, as we can see it from our windows (and in some cases our ivory towers). Fairness in many respects is like responsibility for actions or agency.

We have precursor electrical impulses before we do things and nature/nurture takes care of the rest.

We must both understand the limitations of fairness, but practice and preach it as both a virtue and the path to a better future. Espousing unfairness as the justification and posing the question \"what are you going to do about it\" or some variant is fine for decisive action planning (e.g having your hand caught under a rock), but for long term and large groups we must use better constructs like fairness to try to form an autonomous form of help and insurance.

That's not meant to be elite, it's just being new practice is a different ball game than having been with it for a while.  Being a visiting monk can be a rather strenuous commitment.  It's also not really appropriate for the resident monks to be around someone new.  It's hard to explain but there is a kind of stress that occurs for more senior practitioners around new practitioners for that length of time.  Senior practitioners love to teach and have infinite patience, but as a visiting monk you are in their lives much more frequently on a day-to-day basis as opposed to when teaching a workshop that ends and everyone drives home.

I get headaches for the next 2 days after a single coffee if I don't have one either those following days to top it off w/ the twitching.\n\nAnyways thanks for the post and extra motivation I needed. \n\nQuick question, Do you still eat chocolate, drink alcohol, or sugar sometimes?  I have been trying to go for runs lately and it seems to help some, but I cannot kick this *deep* craving for a dopamine pickup, it never seems to go away and I am so fatigued all the time. I know chocolate has caffeine in it though so can't do that.\n\nAt night when the mild depression feeling hits I almost just want to say \"screw it!\" and make a run to starbucks, but I know it will mess my nervous system up for days, and it's funny because we are talking caffeine here, not some sort of hardcore drug. I don't know why I am having such a hard time with this and my nervous system can't just be normal like other people. I can't handle alcohol either.\n\nWhat even more confusing is all the the websites like Mayo Clinic say caffeine withdrawals should only last 4 days, so it has me wondering if something else is actually going on."], [7, "Nothing wrong with playing games.

I recommend it. \n\nIf you can get past the fact that his audience seems to be male fathers trying to succeed in business, and that the book largely shaped 80s and 90s yuppie business culture, you'll actually find that his description of \"character ethic\", choices, his \"Time Management Matrix\", and his \"upward spiral\" ideas are super insightful and useful.\n\nThe upward spiral is one of the most critical ideas. Many people self-criticize or talk themselves down constantly, or are afraid of being judged as a fake or whatever. The upward spiral says no to that. It says that the \"downward spiral\" gets too much press.  At any moment in time, you can grab your life's reigns and nudge it toward something intentionally. You can do your future self favors.  Coupled with the character ethic, this is powerful because it says not only that you're worthy of good stuff, but that your focus on your underlying character can see you through self-doubt and worries about negative judgment. Planning and doing right by people go a long way, and a lot of the rest really is superficial stories people tell themselves about how they ought to act or portray themselves.\n\nThat also fits with the idea of \"Growth Mentality\". If you believe it's possible to grow and improve, you now have the space to do it. But if you're feel you're trapped by your own circumstances, then you might be trapping yourself *arbitrarily*.\n\nThat ties in with the  idea that EVERYTHING YOU DO IS A CHOICE. He says a lot people think of life \"happening to them\", perhaps as a means of shirking responsibility for choices that led to bad or uneventful outcomes.\n\nThe Time Management Matrix does a good job of putting things like video games into a larger perspective, without automatically demonizing them.\n\nOverall, worth it."], [6, "The fuck is a \"life\" and can I eat it?"], [4, "I've recently started to get going in life as well.

I would just kind of deal with it because caffeine has a profound positive effect on my mood during the day.\n\nWhat kind of bothers me though is that that I'm on day 11 and for the last two night I have been getting that mild depression feeling returning again. I've never had this problem in my life, and it's making me think it could be an after effects of the gabapentin I was on 5 months ago for the Bell's Palsy residue facial pain. (I am completely drug free now though)\n\nI am having very deep cravings for a coffee or chocolate, because I know it will immediately turn my day around and give me some much needed energy. It works every time, but the side effects from my stupid sensitive nervous system just aren't worth it, and I will pay for it for days. I get headaches for the next 2 days after a single coffee if I don't have one either those following days to top it off w/ the twitching.\n\nAnyways thanks for the post and extra motivation I needed. \n\nQuick question, Do you still eat chocolate, drink alcohol, or sugar sometimes?  I have been trying to go for runs lately and it seems to help some, but I cannot kick this *deep* craving for a dopamine pickup, it never seems to go away and I am so fatigued all the time. I know chocolate has caffeine in it though so can't do that.\n\nAt night when the mild depression feeling hits I almost just want to say \"screw it!\" and make a run to starbucks, but I know it will mess my nervous system up for days, and it's funny because we are talking caffeine here, not some sort of hardcore drug. I don't know why I am having such a hard time with this and my nervous system can't just be normal like other people.

There could be some other factors going that could be contributing to your feelings of withdrawel. You may also be mistaking feelings of withdrawal with other feelings, like sleep deprevation or a sluggishness from inactivity. Make sure you sleep well and excercise. \n\nPersonally I have not quit caffiene yet, but I've lowered my dosage to about 90mg most days from 600 mg a day that it use to be. I don't think my goal is to fully quit, just to reduce the dosage to a level that doesn't make me feel worse or crash at the end of the day. 90 mg seems to be ok for that most days. \n\nWhat has helped me is using a tracking app. In android I use keeptrack pro (which has a small subscription fee). For every caffienated drink I consume, I look up how much caffiene it has on Google or its label. After a while you just know, but at first I was suprised at how much caffiene was in major coffee place's coffee. A med cup of coffee for most place is actuatly slightly over 2 cups of coffee and it has more caffiene than your home brewed stuff. \n\nAnyway. I was slowly able to reduce my dosage by tracking my consumption. It was important for me to not worry about messing up one day and consuming more than the previous day. I instead focused on having a long term trend of declining caffiene consumption, and so far, it's worked out great. I rarely have crashes anymore and negative side effects from too much caffiene consumption. \n\nHope that helps. ", "id": "d7t04x8"}], [{"comment": "Nothing wrong with playing games.

Coupled with the character ethic, this is powerful because it says not only that you're worthy of good stuff, but that your focus on your underlying character can see you through self-doubt and worries about negative judgment. Planning and doing right by people go a long way, and a lot of the rest really is superficial stories people tell themselves about how they ought to act or portray themselves.\n\nThat also fits with the idea of \"Growth Mentality\". If you believe it's possible to grow and improve, you now have the space to do it. But if you're feel you're trapped by your own circumstances, then you might be trapping yourself *arbitrarily*.\n\nThat ties in with the  idea that EVERYTHING YOU DO IS A CHOICE. He says a lot people think of life \"happening to them\", perhaps as a means of shirking responsibility for choices that led to bad or uneventful outcomes.\n\nThe Time Management Matrix does a good job of putting things like video games into a larger perspective, without automatically demonizing them.\n\nOverall, worth it.", "id": "d7s70qg"}], [{"comment": "The fuck is a \"life\" and can I eat it?", "id": "d7satp9"}, {"comment": "No you cannot eat it, you can fuck it though.

I cannot imagine ever being not depressed here at home. This home is like the perfect nurturing place for depression. There's nothing pulling or pushing me to anywhere. All I can do is push and pull myself constantly, which gets incredibly tiring.\n\nSo I was wondering, if you're constantly on the move? And if not, how do you stay in one place (for a long period of time, let's say a year or more), and not get depressed?\n\nAt the moment, it feels like all I can do to be happy and not be depressed is to be away from home (this place) for as long as possible.

A growth mindset person thinks that they can learn new things and change.  A fixed mindset person thinks you either have it or you don't.  That's a bit of an oversimplification but you get the idea.\n\nThere was a lot about failure.  A growth minded person will try to learn from failure.  They may actively seek out failure as a way to learn and grow.  A fixed mindset person doesn't like to fail.  They're afraid if they try something and fail it will show that they're no good.  \n\nThere was an interesting section on relationships and how a relationship takes work.  A growth mindset person will realize that and work on it while a fixed mindset person may think if you have to work on your relationship it wasn't meant to be.\n\nOne thing that really hit home for me was how you can be growth minded in some areas but fixed in others.  I consider myself a fairly growth minded person, I'm always reading and listening things to learn, but one thing that was mentioned specifically was artistic talent.  I've always thought I just couldn't draw.  The author talked about there's actually a book called *Drawing on the right side of the brain* (I think) that's all about teaching people to draw that aren't naturally wired that way.  I think that may have been based on a class on the same thing but I can't remember off the top of my head.  Anyway that was an eyeopener for me.\n\nOverall it was a great book.

Losing that can be akin to losing a major part of themselves.

And I think boiling down the message to \"kill yourself, your friends will appreciate your passion\", is a fairly shallow interpretation of what is actually happening in the movie.\n\nBecause it does come down to whether or not you understand why he committed suicide.

If you are asking how to improve your writing, I would suggest reading books, paying attention to the author's use of both advanced vocabulary, as well as how he uses ordinary words to convey precicely what he wishes to.   \n     Being a good writer doesn't depend on having an exhaustive vocabulary. It helps, but there are more important things to good writing than vocabulary. A lot of it (hehe) has to do with specificity of language; when I write something, I say what I mean and leave no ambiguity or misleading connotations attached to words. You can make a phrase very specific and to the point by using more nuanced and less common words, but that isn't strictly necessary, and can even be cumbersome at times. Furthermore, focusing on incorporating a massive and obscure vocabulary into your writing, while other facets are severely lacking, leads to the stuff you see on /r/iamverysmart. The distinction between \"good\" and \"bad\" here is that good usage adds value to a piece, while bad usage distracts the reader. The difference between the two lies entirely in how necessary the substitution is to conveying precisely what you want to say. The peoples on /r/iamverysmart add nothing of value to their writing and make unwarranted trips to a thesaurus just to wow a reader, whereas a strong writer will do everything in their power to transpose not just words, but feelings, prejudices, and even sensory details associated with one thing or another. \n\n     Again, it is often the case that an author can add detailed and nuanced descriptions and perspectives without touching a thesaurus at all. I suggest you study imagery, descriptive writing, and figurative language. While you might not use what you learn directly, you will surely gain greater control over words and be more comfortable writing. \n\n*disclaimer: I am aware that I am not the best writer, and this example is surely lacking, but I want to give you an idea how much you can improve your writing while still using everyday vocabulary.\n\nExample:\n\n Her brow creased as she tried, vainly, to draw to the surface the identity of this faceless visitor.

While weapons should be made of metals (certain bones/teeth are good for weapons), you'll often just make sets of PVE armor out of bones/teeth with either a silk or fur backing. Fur gives more protection but is heavier, silk is simply lighter weight. \n\nThe focus is 99% PVP. There is exploration to be done, but you mostly farm stuff to make money to buy steel off people to make steel sets to PVP. Also annoying thing, if your mount dies, it's dead, forever, need to tame and level a new one. \n\nEither way, it's free to try, you can get 1100 skill points but you can't max them individually to 100, only to 60, so you make more jack of all trades builds. So you can make a mounter archer + lance + spear with taming and some magic on the side. Someone that pays to play can max skills to 100, so they focus on one role, which makes them better than you, but you can try to beat them with multi rolls.

My sister and I moved in with grandma that was an alcoholic and lived off the government. It was a big change, from the suburbs to the worst neighborhood in Miami, FL. By 10-11yrs old, confused and scared of our future, I resulted to violence and other illegal activities in order to provide for my sister. The change was too drastic for my sister and she began having suicidal thoughts. My childhood consisted of bringing my sister back to life multiple times in a puddle of blood and saving my grandmas life from an overdose or alcohol related accident. I soon dropped out of school at 14 after failing the 6th and 7th grade twice. The streets chewed me up for the years to come. \r\n\r\nAt 17, I was brutally beat with several objects after my best friend set me up with a rival gang. My lungs collapsed, jaw and chin were dislocated and my hips were crushed. I was a new man, after a year and a half of treatment. I was now\u2026. . Addicted to pain killers. I couldn\u2019t believe it, I felt like the accident helped me get away from that negative lifestyle I\u2019ve always hated deep inside.

Was lucky to find methadone in the black market. Rented a hotel for 2wks, created a methadone schedule and turned my phone off. I'll never forget the joy I had when I escaped hell.

I\u2019m at the top of every class I\u2019ve attended so far. \r\nI\u2019m proud of myself but can\u2019t help but to worry that I might fall again one day.

Literally laughing at me in front of extended family. I hated him. Ended up going to community college then dropped out of art school to support myself. 20 years later I went back to school and graduated from the college of engineering number one in my class. Scored a 100 on my statistics final. My last two years of undergrad were actually grad school classes because I did so well. I carried 21 credits while working a 60 hour a week job.

My sister and I moved in with grandma that was an alcoholic and lived off the government. It was a big change, from the suburbs to the worst neighborhood in Miami, FL. By 10-11yrs old, confused and scared of our future, I resulted to violence and other illegal activities in order to provide for my sister. The change was too drastic for my sister and she began having suicidal thoughts. My childhood consisted of bringing my sister back to life multiple times in a puddle of blood and saving my grandmas life from an overdose or alcohol related accident. I soon dropped out of school at 14 after failing the 6th and 7th grade twice. The streets chewed me up for the years to come. \r\n\r\nAt 17, I was brutally beat with several objects after my best friend set me up with a rival gang. My lungs collapsed, jaw and chin were dislocated and my hips were crushed. I was a new man, after a year and a half of treatment. I was now\u2026. . Addicted to pain killers. I couldn\u2019t believe it, I felt like the accident helped me get away from that negative lifestyle I\u2019ve always hated deep inside. But now, I\u2019ve been introduced to the other side of the spectrum. I asked my doctor for help and he suggested rehab.  I was humiliated and refused to go. Fast forward to the time where I was beginning to have a fear of death with each passing day. I got on online to search any and every remedy possible to get out of this hell. Was lucky to find methadone in the black market. Rented a hotel for 2wks, created a methadone schedule and turned my phone off. I'll never forget the joy I had when I escaped hell. They\u2019re tears running down as we speak\u2026. \r\n\r\nToday, 28yrs old, with a wife and a baby girl. The moment I found out that I was going to be a father, I freaked out! I don\u2019t want my kid to live the reality that I did. I spent hundreds of dollars and hours on elementary, junior and senior high school literature. Took the ged test and passed it after 4 times.  Then studied for college entrance, scored high and got accepted. I\u2019m at the top of every class I\u2019ve attended so far. \r\nI\u2019m proud of myself but can\u2019t help but to worry that I might fall again one day. I think of my past and it puts me back in place. I wish I started earlier so that I can enjoy my baby girl more often. I work full time, school part time, raising a family and learning new skills when I have a chance(coding, writing, etc\u2026) \r\nIf I can do it, anyone can! \r\nI truly mean this. \nPs: I was beyond lucky to dodge jail or death on my way to this moment; though the outcome was different for all of my peers. \n", "id": "d5fqakq"}], [{"comment": "Great job man, go relax and have a beer!

Sit for a moment. Starting to feel motivated? Enter the building. Otherwise, go home. But it's a start.\n\nNext, buy the membership. Don't have to actually do anything, just become a member. While you're there, if you start to feel motivated, go stand on the treadmill. That's right - just stand there. Find out where it is and stand there for ten seconds. Starting to feel motivated? Turn it on, walk very slow. Don't even bother breaking a sweat. Starting to feel more motivated? Turn it up, get to a jogging pace, keep it going for five short minutes.\n\nAt any point if you don't start to feel motivated, go home.

Breaking the ice is such a huge hurtle, because it's massively mental.\n\nDigressing ...\n\nI think this post is relevant to breaking procrastination because those tiny, wimpy, seemingly progress-less steps are steps you actually *should* be proud of.

However, I personally feel sort of overdressed in high heels, stockings & dress while around people in jeans. Everybody is staring at me & asking \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion for that?\u201d Have you ever been in that kind of situation? How to be brave enough to go on with glamour style every day? How do you deal with unwanted attention?\n\n>>-Malina Kaa\n\n>Dear Malina,\n\n>In my 20+ years of dressing up in retro style, I\u2019ve certainly had my fair share of stupid questions and criticisms, and I\u2019ve even been flat-out made fun of, especially back in the early 90s before retro glamour became so popular and when my outfits were even more extravagant than they are now!\n\n>I recall a moment I had once that really cured me of feeling self-conscious. Two guys made fun of me in passing, who were both dressed in hideously ugly, stained and torn \u201cUniversity of Idiocy\u201d T-shirts with mismatched shorts and some sort of offensive footwear.\n\n>I remember thinking, \u201cWait a minute, the fact that THESE guys think I look silly/crazy/unsexy is actually a compliment!\u201d\n\n>I also began to realize that our appearance tells the world which tribe we belong to, or want to belong to. I have absolutely no desire to be a part of the tribe that those two guys belong to, you know? Imagine the hell of being asked out on a date with one of them? Heaven forbid I would fall in love with him and be forced to watch sports on TV while fetching a beer and a Manwich for one of those guys. That sounds like a special kind of hell to me.\n\n>I\u2019ve said it time and time again. You can be a juicy, ripe peach and there\u2019s still going to be someone who doesn\u2019t like peaches, so you can either submit to someone\u2019s criticism of you, or you can get on with the business of being your own amazing self who attracts other like-minded people that appreciate you.\n\n>I often think about my icons of beauty and style, and I am quite certain that they received their fair share of ridicule, but if they hadn\u2019t dared to be different, there are countless fashion styles that probably would have never made it to the mainstream.\n\n>Can you imagine if Marlene Dietrich had merely accepted that hotels in Paris wouldn\u2019t welcome her while she was wearing a man\u2019s tuxedo? Can you imagine the things people might have said as Isabella Blow wafted down the street in a billowing cape and one of her many enormous hats? I\u2019d met her a few times, always astonished by her inspiring style, and I can tell you that she certainly didn\u2019t give a crap what anyone thought of her, and for me and many others, she is highly regarded as one of the most important and most fashionable women ever.\n\n>Nothing great comes without risk, and only the very mediocre are safe from being poked fun at. Personally, every time someone makes a snide comment, I feel I am proud to be part of the elite group of weirdos! If you want to read a fabulous and hilarious book about this eccentric \u201cclub,\u201d check out Simon Doonan\u2019s \u201cEccentric Glamour.\u201d\n\n>I\u2019ve had all sorts of comebacks to the various \u201cvocal observations\u201d of my attire and my look, but I try to say positive things like, \u201cWhy yes, the special occasion is life, thank you for noticing!\u201d\n\n>Back in the 90s, before retro glamour was in fashion, I would get asked if I was in a movie and I would say, \u201cYes, I\u2019m starring in this amazing story of my own life,\u201d with a positive attitude and tone of voice whenever possible. Sometimes people don\u2019t mean to be rude, they just noticed you and they don\u2019t realize that what they say might make you feel uncomfortable.\n\n>I really think we just have to forgive them, because they just don\u2019t know, and sometimes, they even fear what they don\u2019t know, and we should have sympathy for them. And, I have to add, that if you are already feeling uncomfortable, it might not even be that they are being rude, but their words are magnified and mirroring what you are feeling, so maybe it\u2019s more about finding ways to find your own comfort zone and working on self-confidence.\n\n>I hope this helps, carry on with being the fabulous glambassador that you are, and don\u2019t let them get you down!\n\n>xx\n\n>Dita", "id": "cz6gs4y"}, {"comment": "Man walks down the street in that hat, people know he's not afraid of anything.", "id": "cz6johi"}, {"comment": "First off, you don't wear a hat during an interview.

Advice is an opinion to emphasize solutions, platitudes are opinions so general that they can be applied to any/every solution. It's like listing a hundred different answers to a math problem.

Im relearning it's ok to fail...", "id": "d4130tq"}, {"comment": "Best of luck. You've picked maybe the single most difficult genre to do right. \n\nSome words of warning:\n\n1. Wizards fucking suck for the exact same reason Superman fucking sucks. Use them at your own peril, but if you must, make sure they're shackled in the narrative at all times as Tolkein did. The second a Wizard is free to go about his day, your story falls into deus ex machina dreck. \n\n2. In music we have a saying that effects are best used sparingly. The same is true of fantasy in writing. Fantasy is a seasoning, not the main course. This is why A Song of Ice and Fire became the mega hit it is. At least early on, you could have removed the fantastical elements entirely and just made it a medieval fiction story and it still would have been every bit as brilliant. \n\n3. Point number 2 should also highlight for you the extreme need to genuinely know your subject matter. Martin's books work because he has some working knowledge of medieval european caste systems, culture, and practices. This breaths a necessary authenticity into his work which provides the sturdy legs on which fantasy can safely be set. At the end of the day, a reader only has so much \"suspending of disbelief\" they can engage in before their interest plummets. The less you ask of your reader in that respect the more liberty you can take with your fantasy. If the world is real enough, the fake stuff will be real too. STUDY FIRST, write second.\n\n4. Because you're a professed ameture I'll warn you about a most common error beginning writers make: Never confuse scenario for plot. Lots of people can dream up imaginative worlds and circumstances, but unless you can relate those worlds to the reader through characters who are sympathetic within the framework of the tone you're trying to set, it wont matter one little bit. It's not the war that's important, it's the love story happening among the bombs and political intrigues that your readers will identify with. Your personal fantasy world will NEVER be as good to any of your readers as their own. You have to sell it with plot, narrative, and relateable characters. If your characters cannot \"live\" in a non-fantasy setting, they are doubly dead in a fantasy setting. (Relateability is also another reason wizards fucking suck. No one can relate to the manner of unrestrained personal liberty a wizard has through magic except serial killers)\n\n5. One of the most pressing problems of fantasy writing is that these worlds have additional \"rules\" you have to outline in a way that wont bore the reader to suicide. No one wants to read a text book of USEFUL real world knowledge; they damn sure don't want to read a text book of your made up arbitrary rules. How you present the extents, limits and consequences of magic/dragons/spirits/elves/what-have-you, will make all the difference in the world. Always remember the oldest rule of storytelling: SHOW, don't tell. EDIT: As a soft rule, there's also the notion that you can tell how lousy your story is by the amount of made-up words your reader has to learn. This is not true %100 of the time, but it's very telling that few people without a linguist's education can pull off a \"Lord of the Rings\" style environment. Fake names, town names, magical terms get hokey in a heart beat. Unless you're going for camp this can quickly ruin the mood you're trying to set so try to stay well within the bounds of common parlance.\n\nYou pay attention to these five issues and you'll set yourself up for success.

Specifically, one needs to understand enough math so as to be able to chart one's progress towards that goal as well as having a skill or trade that would allow them to capitalize their work.\n\nYou can be a dedicated, tireless worker at any skill and still not become rich - and that's not for trying. Look at the number of people who went to school, got an education, worked for their entire lives, saved for retirement and then were wiped out during this last recession. These were not stupid people who were lazy, they were people who did what they were told would get them ahead and then wiped out when the economy shifted.\n\nIs there a secret to getting rich? No, not really. For every Bill Gates there is a [Gary Kildall](http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/fa-dr.htm) (who still did well, just nowhere near what could have been).\n\nHere is what I do know about becoming rich:\n\n* Opportunity favors the prepared mind.\n* Learning to recognize real opportunity is a skill all in of itself.\n* Hard work, dedication, and the ability to ignore criticism is critical.\n\nAnd with those three things outlined, there are significantly more people who do not become rich than do by doing everything they should.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, success is achieving happiness in life and thinking that money will buy happiness is a fool's errand. Do what you enjoy and you will likely succeed but the relentless pursuit of money is a dead end.\n\nWith that said, sitting on your ass and doing nothing will get you nowhere but the advice in the comic about how to achieve beauty comes close to actually teaching a solid lesson.\n\nSorry for the adverse opinion, someone had to say it.\n"], [790, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_of_poverty"], [684, " "], [537, "Jesus Christ, this kind of \"The Secret\" bullshit really REALLY pisses me off.

The answer given by the author works for everything else.  \nObviously, for someone who is sick or in an extreme situation it is not enough to simply rethink what you need to be happy.

Yes, there is an element of truth to what's contained there but an awful lot is missing.\n\nAs an example of what I am trying to convey, how can one figure out what they need to do to become rich if they don't have the necessary tools to correctly identify how to become rich? Specifically, one needs to understand enough math so as to be able to chart one's progress towards that goal as well as having a skill or trade that would allow them to capitalize their work.\n\nYou can be a dedicated, tireless worker at any skill and still not become rich - and that's not for trying.

Do what you enjoy and you will likely succeed but the relentless pursuit of money is a dead end.\n\nWith that said, sitting on your ass and doing nothing will get you nowhere but the advice in the comic about how to achieve beauty comes close to actually teaching a solid lesson.\n\nSorry for the adverse opinion, someone had to say it.\n", "id": "da983q4"}, {"comment": "This viewpoint of this comic seems ultra-libertarian.

People don't have those problems because they want them, and successfully dealing with them is not by any stretch merely a matter of being sufficiently motivated. What makes them especially pernicious is that some of them can interfere with the *ability* to get motivated. Without getting overly philosophical about it, they compromise free will.

Finding happiness it a long process of trial and error.. there's no way around it.. you have to fail before you can succeed..\n\n**The guy in the comic _never_ said that you will get rich if you just want it enough..!** What he said is, if you want to be rich and you're not, it might be because there were more pressing immediate wants that you were not aware of.. Wants that might indicate that getting rich is not worth the effort or even possible, given the obstacles your circumstances put in your way.. That trying to get rich might not make you happy after all.. Maybe there are other more achievable wants that will get you closer to happiness..\n\nas the last panel says:\n > **The key is figuring out the right things to want.**\n\n**A big part of getting what we want, is _changing_ what we want..**", "id": "da9gxhu"}], [{"comment": "edgy", "id": "da96re6"}, {"comment": "You can tell by the cigarette.", "id": "da98csk"}, {"comment": "What if what he wants in life is throat cancer?", "id": "da98x3z"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "da9aj5f"}], [{"comment": "aka How Many Platitudes Can You Fit in a Webcomic", "id": "da99huf"}], [{"comment": "I feel that this comic is awfully out of touch with reality, but there is a quote that I like better that may be in the vein of what this is trying to say without being quite as... blatantly unbelievable... \n\n\"You can't work so hard that you can overcome everything, but you can overcome a hell of a lot with a good work ethic.\" ~Layne Norton", "id": "da9azgs"}], [{"comment": "Yeah, cause everything is just that simple.

Why do we want to have money? I do not think the comic is talking about job success, but that if your goal in life was to get money, you would even cheat, steal or kill for it. But we do not do it because we have moral principles and that is more important for us. Why do we want to be more attractive? The answer given by the author works for everything else.  \nObviously, for someone who is sick or in an extreme situation it is not enough to simply rethink what you need to be happy.

You could consider picking up the guitar a waste because you may never achieve anything professionally and to achieve something productive from it you will have to devote a large amount of time to it and many people don't have such time.\n\nI know this is r/getmotivated and i will probably be downvoted to hell but my overall message is, \"If you are happy with how you spend your time then it is never time wasted\"."], [15, "OP, I realized something recently that could really help you out. I too was in a position where I realized that I was playing too many games, not being social, and becoming completely unmotivated in work and school. It got to the point where I was failing class, gaining distance between friendships and other relationships, and almost losing my job. There were times where I would lay in bed for an hour and just not go to class, or call off work. I was severely depressed and I couldn't figure out why.\n\nBut after doing some reading and some existential reflection, I came to the conclusion that the only thing stopping me from being responsible and getting my shit done before goofing off was myself and being happy was **myself**. There would be times where I would be sitting in class thinking about getting home, playing video games and just blowing off all of my other work to do. Sounds great, right? The reality is, it's the worst thing ever, and subconsciously, it gets to you and really makes you feel worse and as you stated, worthless. You know how you'd sit there, playing games, having a good time but there seemed to be this looming feeling of regret or like you're forgetting something really important? That's your brain telling you subconsciously that you've got shit to do, you're just CHOOSING to ignore it or not do it. It makes things worse.\n\nSo what did I do to remedy this? I got myself motivated by my own means and realized that **I** only have one life and that **I** am the one in control. Do video games make me happy? Hell yes they do! It's another world outside of the real one where I can do whatever I want, be whatever I want, and have a great time with friends. But when you've got shit to do where it be work, homework, or other obligations, you gotta crank those suckers out like a daily quest.\n\nIf you look at the real world... Life is also just a game. There are daily quests everywhere and some are way more important than others. All you have to do is get that one addon that helps you organize them by priority and get it done. The quest reward? **THE REST OF THE TIME TO DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT.** It's a great feeling because you worked hard for an awesome reward at the end of the day.\n\n**TL;DR:** Just thought my story might be able to help you out, OP.

Losing the enjoyment of relaxing and impulsively playing because it's so routine is a problem.  I'm kind of in the same place myself and I didn't think it was a problem until I'd try to take a break and couldn't go a day without destroying all humans.  One problem you might face is the fucking void you feel when you curb an addiction.  You might not know what to do with your extra free time and that can feel depressive. If you hit that wall, and any time you feel it. I recommend immediately going  outside and walk far without any direction.  You don't want to wallow in your room and ruminate.  Also try packing away your console/computer out of sight.  Without directly seeing it you're less likely to 'relapse' and it will force your brain to think of other forms of entertainment.

The promise that the next level or big win could come at any time is what makes a game compelling. It's also what makes a game hard to quit. One study found that playing a video game led to dopamine increases equivalent to amphetamine use- and it's this dopamine rush that makes both so addictive. The unpredictability of scoring or advancing keeps your dopamine neurons firing, and you glued to your seat.

The unpredictability of scoring or advancing keeps your dopamine neurons firing, and you glued to your seat. Depending on your point of view, this makes for either incredible entertainment or unethical exploitation of gamers.

They're a hyper stimulus. They're designed from the ground up to be addictive/habit forming. To release as much dopamine as possible for the smallest effort. This is why you hear about people dying slumped over their monitor playing Starcraft or spending all night clicking through videos on Pornhub, \n\nThink about a reward in a videogame. Like lvling up or a new weaopon. Light shoots down from the sky onto you and an angelic choir fucking sings from the heavens. And what did you do to deserve that? You spent twenty minutes clearing out a cave of trolls or got a scroll from the top of a cliff or some shit. But your brain cannnot tell it isn't real llfe and responds with a dopamine hit like you just killed a mountain lion and returned to your tribe wearing its skin for the praise of men and affections of women. But you're actually sitting on the couch twiddling your thumbs. \n\nBiting into the engineered and perfectly calibrated formula of fat and salt in junk food does the same thing. Looking at hundreds of naked women online, your brain responds with dopamine like you're a mangod of the savannah. When in actual fact you're hunched over your monitor in the dark tugging your half erect peepee. \n\nNow many people can handle these hyper stimuli and lead fully functional healthy lives, and many cannot. Personally I'd argue they're no good for anyone. But everyone needs to realise that there is a chasm between tv, books and other hobbies and videogaming. And that's where a lot of people need to draw the line.\n\nVideogames can effectively replace any real life desire to achieve anything, because you have engineered and artificial achievement right in front of you with no element of risk or fear of failure.", "id": "d262t1c"}, {"comment": "Your argument pretty much depends upon reducing each medium of entertainment into radical cliches.\n\nFor example, reading The Iliad, and reading 50 shades of grey. One stimulates thought, the other stimulates dopamine. It's the exact same for a game like Bioshock versus World of Warcraft. One provides a thought-provoking story, the other rewards grinding. \n\nThe main difference between any video game and any real-life experience is the emotions, memories and sensations you have while taking part in them. The similarity between pornography and video games are not that they emanate from a screen.\n\nYou can reduce anything down to radical examples with simple wordplay. Example of playing football; booting around a little ball in the dirt, desperately trying to get it into a box, which will then release dopamine because you think you've achieved something. Or example of playing a video game; delving into a different dimension and experiencing a world and story which your life could never have experienced otherwise.\n\nNow, neither are really true. It's like I say - the sensations you gain from those experiences are what make them either worthwhile or pointless. And trivial examples like people dying on Starcraft aren't exactly great to point out when using possible death due to addiction over real life experiences. People can become addicted to nearly anything - example; the amount of people who died climbing Mount Everest, or the amount of people who've died from Sports related injuries, versus the amount of people dead because of video game addiction. \n\nThe main bulk of the argument is 'achievement', which when you boil it down, is so subjective that it becomes almost meaningless when looking at achievement outside of your own life. The risk of failure in any task, real life or in a video game, is a real risk - but the consequences greatly depends on what you're actually doing. Both real life events and video games, are almost always designed in a way which means winning is awarded, failure is not.\n\nRemember the diversity. While the first games which spring to mind are often grind-out games like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, League of Legends - often story-line based games or puzzle solving games aren't as popular.

Plenty of successful and happy people play video games.  The problem is the addiction and an addiction could be literally anything. It's just games are so easy to binge on.  If you play to forget your life or avoid problems that's when it becomes an issue, because you will do it excessively and feed negative attitudes into it.  Losing the enjoyment of relaxing and impulsively playing because it's so routine is a problem.  I'm kind of in the same place myself and I didn't think it was a problem until I'd try to take a break and couldn't go a day without destroying all humans.  One problem you might face is the fucking void you feel when you curb an addiction.  You might not know what to do with your extra free time and that can feel depressive. If you hit that wall, and any time you feel it. I recommend immediately going  outside and walk far without any direction.  You don't want to wallow in your room and ruminate.

There is a reason grandma is at the casino and Jimmy is in his room alone all day with his computer. From The Willpower Instinct: \"Cell phones, the Internet, and other social media may have accidentally exploited our reward system, but computer and video game designers intentionally manipulate the reward system to keep players hooked. The promise that the next level or big win could come at any time is what makes a game compelling. It's also what makes a game hard to quit. One study found that playing a video game led to dopamine increases equivalent to amphetamine use- and it's this dopamine rush that makes both so addictive. The unpredictability of scoring or advancing keeps your dopamine neurons firing, and you glued to your seat. Depending on your point of view, this makes for either incredible entertainment or unethical exploitation of gamers. While not everyone who picks up an Xbox controller gets hooked, for those who are vulnerable, games can be as addictive as any drug.

There are so many responsibilities and choices, you will always feel overwhelmed. You will always feel uncomfortable. But discomfort is growth. Every time you fail and actually *feel* that you failed, you learn. The more it eats you up inside, the greater your chances of ###learning.###\n\nThe greatest advice I hear of older people is that \"youth is wasted on the young\". These are not just belligerent people who dream of being millionaires when they were twenty. They are people who unserstand the crucible that is life. You enter this world with all the gold and silver and special pieces but it's mixed with dirt and debris. Only through time and trouble will the useless traits begin to break away from the better parts of you. And no one leaves the world as pure gold. There is no perfection, just varying degrees of acceptable.\n\nI implore all who read this to make changes. Think of it like an experiment. Today I will change x and measure the result. If you can't change anything, change everything, self destruct if you have to. Only through suffering will we truly learn.\n\nYou have a long and dangerous road ahead of you, reader. When the world works as it should, you will hate your very birth. You will always feel the need to cry and scream and flip tables in hatred of the life you lead. Find solace in the fact that you are a player in a losing game. But always let the better bits of you shine. Change for the better, every day.

A few months ago I started living alone. I had never done it before. I'm 30 but always had a gf or friends living with me. I went deep into depression (not diagnosed and probably hyperbole) and just disappeared for a week. I didn't talk to anybody about how lonely I was because that puts my problems on others. I am slowly working on talking to people. I am genuinely blessed to have the family I have. They talk to me and I talk back. They love unconditionally and want me happy.\n\nThat was my wake up call. I did something highly irresponsible and almost lost everything. I had just bought a house I had a great job and I was just lonely. \n\nI'm still lonely but I love being alone now. I don't allow my negative thoughts to dictate my life. My boss was worried about me and kept trying to call me. I finally contacted him back and he gave me a job, albeit in a lower position than I was, but with the ability to rebuild trust and put myself back into a good position. He talks to me a couple times a week to just see how I am. He doesn't realize it but he helped to save me from spiraling even further out of control. I began therapy because normal people don't leave their lives behind because they are sad and I need to talk to somebody that doesn't have a dog in the fight. \n\nI'm amazing at giving people, according to them, great logical advice but when push comes to shove I knowingly ignore my own advice. I finally took my advice and got some help. I don't deal with any drug or alcohol abuse so it wasn't that, I just...poofed. \n\nTo add to this I wasn't lonely from a lack of friends or loved ones. I just isolated myself from them. I'm not swimming in friends or anything but there are a handful of people I'd do anything for and vice versa I just never took them up on helping me.

Watch out on how you dress, shower, trim your nails and pluck your nose, etc. You're lucky to be alive in a time where there's Tinder, so use it. Be sociable!

Shit I should not do this with my primary, but yolo!\n\nWaaaay back in school, I was in a really awesome class. There was very little of the usual teenage drama, we were really good friends and hung out outside of school too.\n\nOne day, we all decide we should do something cool, so the entire class signs up to a dancing course, classical and latin american (waltz, tango, that kind of thing).\n\nOn the second or so lesson, this gorgeous black haired girl asks me to dance. We do pretty well, we chat a bit, and hit it off, she is awesome.\n\nI, being 15 and mortally stupid (two things that basically mean the same anyway), don't realize she is SUPER into me and constantly hitting on me. The thought that a gorgeous, flawless super hot girl like that could actually like zit-riddled teenage me never even occurred to me.\n\nAnyway, we keep dancing the whole year in the course, with her hitting on me and me being too dumb to realize it. She kept doing it because I guess she mistook my retardedness for playing hard to get or something.\n\n\nBut it gets worse.\n\n\nAt the end of the course, we have this fantastic graduation ball. Guys with black tie, girls in the most gorgeous gowns. She wears this stunning frirly black number with a barely legal cut I try hard not to stare at the entire night. As we dance, she whispers in my ear: \n\n\n\"Hey...you can dance closer to me, if you like...\"\n\n\nTo which suave motherfucking me responds: \"...naw, that's cool, I'll just step on your feet.\"\n\n\nBut it gets even worse.\n\n\nWe dance most of the night, until, after getting some drinks, I spot her sitting at our table with a depressed look.\n\n\"My shoe broke. *Points at the broken off heel of her shoe* so I will go home.\"\n\n\"I live very close by...and my parents are not home...\"\n\nTo which I, naturally, respond: \"Oh ok, so you don't have it far, that's good. I'm gonna dance with that chick over there then, see ya.\"\n\nThe rest of the night I tried to puzzle out why she gave me that disappointed look.\n\n\nBut wait, it gets STILL worse.\n\n\nSome years later, I must have been 18 or 19, I see her again randomly, at a party. We have an amazing chat, and by this age I actually knew better and was doing decently dealing with girls. Usually. \n\nEveryone is well and truly drunk, including me. So I stumble about, trying to find a couch or something to have a nap. I bust into this one room, and there she is, partially undressed, making out on the bed with a female FWB of mine.\n\nI proceed to stand in the door like a brain damaged cave man. My brain no longer had dibs on oxygen supply is what I'm sayin'.\n\nAfter a good 10 seconds or so of staring, the girl goes: \"So...will you just stand there like an idiot, or will you come and join us?\"\n\n\nThis was it! Oh yes!!! Fuck the hell YES! Awesome!!\n\n\n\"Naw, you two look like you know what you're doing.\" I heard myself saying. Somehow, when drunk during this part of my life, I just completely beta'd out.\n\nSo I find a couch or something and crash there.\n\nIn hindsight it's pretty funny. It wasn't right after.

Even if your drug of choice has minimal withdrawal, when you are trying to fix a piece of yourself with drugs, you never do, you just temporarily hide your problems from yourself, and when you quit, not only do you have to deal with withdrawal, but you also have to deal with all those problems you were \"Fixing\" coming back.  This also applies to medicine, anti depressants/anti anxiety.  They never tell you that when they prescribe it, and I believe the world would be better off without the majority of psych meds and drugs, but oh well, it is what it is.  Just be careful, you could ruin your life.  I'll vouch for that.

And even then it's another set of challenges to keep pushing your boundaries in a safe manner and get stronger, run farther. I don't say this to deter you of course, but the biggest thing to keep in mind is that going to the gym, running, or working out in general isn't just something you do for a little while to get to a healthy point and then take a break; you should get yourself into the mindset that this is the day you start changing your life one day at a time.\n\nI'm happy to assist with meal plans or suggestions on workouts, and there is a wealth of knowledge on /r/fitness in threads and FAQs that break it down based on what your training goals are (bulking in muscle, body weight, running, eating, etc.). Greek yogurt and granola are great starts nutrition-wise; my caveat is to watch out for sugar content in either; you'd be surprised just how much sugar is involved in foods that are marketed \"healthy\", and even \"non-fat\" items just replace fat and sugar with fake sugar, so if you're not keen on reading nutrition facts now's a good time to get some knowledge on that. I recommend IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros) in regards to protein/carb/fat intake; you can calculate how much of each you need based on weight, height, frequency of working out, gender, etc. IIFYM is a lot more modular in how you eat; for example, let's say you need 200g of protein, 150g of carbs, 30g of fat. If you eat a breakfast burrito and you get 50g of protein, 80g of carbs, 20g of fat, you can adjust your lunch and dinner intake to get the rest of the 150g of protein, 70g of carb, and 10g of fat from different foodstuffs that won't set you over on your numbers. Calories-wise, it's similar in the sense that if you need to only eat 1700 calories but have breakfast that's 1000 calories, you'll need to adjust the next couple meals to take in 700 without going too far above that 1700 at worst.\n\nThere are plenty of different suggestions out there, but IIFYM is a great starting point and helps you adjust as you go. Lean Gains is another, but it's more advanced in the sense that you're doing something called Intermittent Fasting, which doesn't sound as bad as \"fasting\" suggests, but nonetheless you should definitely get a solid grasp on nutrition intake and what your meal plans will be like before attempting it.\n\nThe biggest take home for calories and macronutrients (protein, carb, fat) is that \"hitting your macros\" is a bigger concern than counting calories. Of course, it doesn't mean you shouldn't count calories at all, but stressing and obsessing over every calorie will only serve to burn you out and shed negative light on working out and getting your sources of energy. It's all a matter of trial and error, and adjusting as you go.\n*****************************************\n\nFrom the sounds of it, I'm guessing you're interested in increasing your running endurance and possibly gaining muscles. I've generally read mixed things on bulking muscle and running, since as you develop muscles you'll also get heavier and running can be a bit of a challenge, but it doesn't mean you can't improve on both as running is still damn good cardio.\n\nBest of luck to you! I know this is a lot of information, and it can be overwhelming from the start, but don't give up; you'll be very tempted to do so, some days more than others, but it only gets better as long as you push yourself and develop a good sense of discipline in carrying out your workout routines!"]], [[{"comment": "I believe in you my friend.

This is worthwhile in the pursuit of self restraint, but impossible taken to the extreme. The meditations are a great narrative example of this, and full of wonderful aphorisms.\n\nTo clarify logical positivism, it's how we determine what are meaningful statements. It mainly deals with science, and the main point for early LPs was the principle of verification - statements are only meaningful if their subject matter can be verified. In this sense, metaphysical inquiry is literally meaningless. This also led to the principle of falsificationism, and a whole class of tangents, such as the Duhem-Quine thesis, the web of beliefs,  absolute realism, and the means to verify scientific experiments. However, as a philosophy logical positivism is all but dead. \n\nThe concept \"life has no meaning but what one gives it\" is more Nietzsche-esque with a hint of existentialism. One could interpret Nihilism as this sinking pit of meaningless, where humans learn there is no absolute meaning, and in response we must make up our own.

Libertarians *do* draw their philosophy from a subset of classical liberals, specifically the English ones.\n\nLibertarians do not take into account French classical liberals like Montesquieu or Jean-Jacques Rousseau.  They do not take into account German classical liberals like Kant or Wilhelm von Humboldt.  They do not want to take in any of the classical liberal traditions that include either positive liberty or republicanism, which more than half of them do.  So libertarians even write off some English classical liberals like Hobbes and Thomas Hill Green.\n\nLibertarians only like a specific subset of almost exclusively English classical liberals like John Locke, David Ricardo, Adam Smith, etc.\n\nEven then, libertarians divert from their analysis appreciably.  The first way they do so is by writing God out of the equation.    This really damages the very core of Locke's theory of property, though, which relied on Genesis and other Christian dogma for its foundation.  But also, the limits someone like Locke would have imposed on complete free marketeering come from the same Christian impulses.   For instance, in the First Treatise, Locke implores that nobody would take advantage of the property system because Christendom forbids it:\n\n>And a man can no more justly make use of another\u2019s necessity to force him to become his vassal by withholding that relief God required him to afford to the wants of his brother, than he that has more strength can seize upon a weaker, master him to his obedience, and, with a dagger at his throat, offer him death or slavery.\n\nThis would seem to mean you can't offer starvation wages or give a child the exclusive choice to work for a multi-billion-dollar company for pennies per day or starve...that the wealthy have a duty demanded from God to care for the less wealthy, and indeed that they must do so.  This is much, much different from modern libertarianism where no such positive duties exist, even to God.\n\nLocke also said:\n\n>God, the lord and father of all has given no one of his children such a property in his peculiar portion of the things of this world, but that he has given his needy brother a right to the surplusage of his goods, so that it cannot justly be denied him when his pressing wants call for it, and therefore, no man could ever have a just power over the life of another by right of property in land or possessions, since it would always be a sin in any man of estate to let his brother perish for want of affording him relief out of his plenty.\n\nAnd maybe this is more direct.  The wealthy in Locke's conception have a duty to give up their land or possessions rather than let their brothers and neighbors die.  This is also not the case in modern libertarianism, where property rights come with no restrictions or riders or requirements for fair and just distribution or use.\n\nSo, while I think it's fair to say that Libertarians are the intellectual heirs to *one strand* of classical liberalism, I think it's also fair to realize that libertarians reject the *vast majority* of classical liberalism in favor of a much more narrow and much more extreme propertarian ideology.", "id": "d3s0fvp"}], [{"comment": "\"They say today's bad luck, &, like all other days, it is.

Ingress was a \"pure\" game that was really its own genre before PoGo, pretty much a data mine for Google originally and now a data mine harvested in the form of another game.\n\nImagine if every pokestop was also a gym, and if your team has the gym, you get better drops out of it. Also in sparsely populated areas a lot of the portals didn't make the cut to pokestops, but of course the only interaction within the game was with portals, so it was a necessity.\n\nNow also imagine if you were to visit a gym/pokestop, and get a key from it for doing so. You can take this key back to another gym and link it back to the one you got, *but* you have to break any links that cross over your link's path, *regardless if it is your own teams link or an enemy link*. Therefore you have to coordinate heavily with your team so they don't block your link.\n\nNow think that if you link 3 in a triangle, your team gains points. More densely populated areas are worth more points (but obviously also much more hotly contested). But these are still gyms and you can fight them anytime so you also need to run around and come back to their defense sometime to drop new defenders in the gym as to not lose your links.\n\nI know that's kind of a tough analogy, but Pokemon Go will probably never be a true successor to Ingress. PoGo is designed that you can play anywhere, while Ingress will have you running off to specific points to meet up with a team of people, as the only way to get a max level portal requires 8 people that are all level 8 or above (level 8 gave you all access to all items, but 9-16 increased your XM reserves, but also required achievements). Teamwork is extremely important, especially for the megafields where literally hundreds of agents will fight people trying to block as well as using a rare item that flips a portal's sides to destroy their own team's links that would be in the way. [Literally some of these links will go across *countries*](https://i.sli.mg/zl1tHA.png).\n\nIngress also highly encouraged super crazy treks. Nobody wants to travel to the top of a mountain so remote that you need a satellite phone to get the internet to connect. Maybe if legendary pokemon were only located there *then* maybe people would do it. But in Ingress it was super advantageous to have these types of portals as anchors to your mega fields, since you could grab keys and bring them back to link to later. Another example is the nuclear test site at Trinity, open to the public only a single day of the year, and one of the most hotly contested portals. Yes, people could spoof these, but Niantic was actually quite good about verifying the extremely outlandish portals.\n\nThere's the missions too, but I hardly ever played them and they were added later anyways.\n\nPokemon Go is just a lot more casual of a game. And that's perfectly fine since that's going to get a much bigger share than the very small group of hardcore Ingress players. Most people hadn't even heard of Ingress before PoGo.

You don't. Have you traveled the world? Do you think all of those people in Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa, etc., are just more virtuous than fat Americans? Of course not. They just don't suffer from the same terrible food culture. The American obsession with fitness culture is a pretty modern thing, and you shouldn't have to jump on board to be a normal human weight. You shouldn't have to perform herculean feats of will-power to be a normal weight.\n\nSure, people should enjoy their bodies, and just like any animal, it's natural for us to want to expend some energy by walking or occasionally engaging in vigorous activity. But we have some pretty fucked up notions for how normal people should behave: \n\n* Track your calories (because I guess we're the only animal on earth that can't naturally self-regulate energy intake)\n* Eat \"guilt free\" foods (because consuming energy should have \"guilt\" attached to it)\n* Do your penance on the stair climber each evening\n\nOur grandparents literally didn't know what a calorie is, but they generally weren't fat. What's up with that?\n\nOur food culture and environment is fucked up. You can combat it by educating yourself and acting upon what you learn, but the info isn't easy to parse, and everything in your environment is trying to sabotage. A lot of people are junk food addicts before they even have a choice in the matter. I don't think it's a moral failing. They're metabolically broken before they have a choice. \n\nIf you want to hit the gym, that's great - I love lifting. But it's our birthright to be a normal weight and for our appetite to naturally regulate itself. We shouldn't need to earn it, and it doesn't mean you're lazy or don't care enough if you find yourself fat.

Why?  Because my schedule does not easily permit the required fitness routines and proper diet required to do so, nor do the available options for nutrition that surround me, given that schedule and level of effort.

I saw a documentary on Netflix that actually highlighted parents who were obsessed that their children did well at sports.

If they get good and go on to play at a collegiate, pro or other good formal level, then I'll support them. \n\nFor instance, I work out 6 days a week myself. My uncle would force me to workout a few times a week when I was nine years old with small weights. I didn't utterly love it at first, for I was lazy. But I have had a love/hate relationship for workouts since that I've rarely lived years of my life without some type of daily workout or sports involvement. And not to brag (which means I'm about to brag), at 40 I am literally stronger than I was at 18, aside from the minor knee pain and muscle pulls that I didn't suffer at that age. Overall, I strongly think that push to get involved with weights at age nine gave me the drive to eat better and be a overall healthy guy for my age.

I loved playing basketball as a kid but didn't like football so much. But, I had tremendous pressure from my dad to keep playing even when I knew myself that I didn't want to.

I had no fucking clue what I was really interested in.  I played Soccer, took up drums, then went to guitar, then went into competition snowboarding, all while still playing golf.

Usually, it is the person who has had every kind of support who is blind to that reality, and thinks it was all their 'hard work' that allowed them to look back on their past with a self-satisfied smile.\n\nAnd any sentence that begins with 'the harsh truth...' or 'the past is past...' is usually straight from the mouths of babes.\n\nImagine spending your life floating in water. It doesn't have to be deep, or cold. You're wearing your clothes, shoes, and socks, because it's a regular day. The shadows of monsters aren't sliding underneath your feet. You're just floating there. It might even be sunny. You might even stretch out onto your back and look up at the sky.\n\nEvery evening, you get a little nervous. You can see, on the horizon, a huge black-bellied ship approaching. Each time you see it, it seems threatening, but you watch it insistently, carefully, and wait for when it becomes clearer to you. Eventually, you notice the strips of coloured lights wrapped around the railings. A pleasant kind of music floats across the water. Friends, family--they're all up there, mingling among strangers. They're having a good time, and they haven't spotted you yet. Even though you know these people, there is a thumping anxiety in your chest. The water feels like a thick hand around your throat.\n\n'Hey!' Someone calls out to you. You don't know who. All you know now is that everyone is looking at you. And it's only now when your body starts to feel heavy, your clothes drag on your skin. It's as if somewhere deep below, a drain has cracked open, and is drawing you towards it.\n\nYou wave back, quickly. They turn to each other, confused. 'Are you okay?' someone asks.\n\n'Yes,' you say, slightly out of breath.\n\n'Are you sure?' they ask. You feel enraged. Enraged at them for asking twice: don't they trust you? Don't they listen to you? And enraged at yourself for being unable to say what you really want to: 'no.' \n\nWhat would they think of you then? That you were weak? And shameful?\n\n'Yes, really, I'm fine,' you shout back. Another smile, another act of parasitic deceit. Your stomach is full of worms. There's no way they'd accept you now--not since you've said yes. They would know you were lying to them. They would find, after interrogating and dissecting you, all of these little creatures that live inside you. How could they love that? How could they not feel disgusted?\n\nYou imagine them turning, vomiting into their napkins. Having spoiled the party, they toss you back over.\n\nYet, for an instant, their love makes you feel warm. They toss out a lifesaver, against your wishes. A perfect orange circle gliding out over the water. It doesn't even miss you. You realise in this moment that it's not being thrown to you, so much as it is, for today, returning to you.\n\nA patchwork of images comes back to you. Thousands of throws, thousands of repetitions of this moment. Your father looks older now. His hair is thinning. Your mother leans on the railing with her chin in her hand. Her wrists are thin. Her expression a smudge of disappointment and grief. Your friends, of which there used to be many, casually glance over the railing before turning back to their conversations.\n\nHow much longer will this go on? How much longer will they pass you by, before they, like you, slip into silence?\n\nThe agony of indecision is short but intense. Your chin is only just above the water. The suction below is strong, but equally strong is your desire to reach out. Perversely, you resist love, and kindness, and compassion, and obey your own self-hatred. Why do these people need to help me? Why can't I swim in by myself? They won't love me until I can take care of myself.\n\nSlowly, you rationalise the impossibility of being saved. The ring has drifted on. You have missed your chance. They must think you're pathetic. They must wonder whether you really love them, whether they really by your distant acts of affection. Even if you did get back--who's to say they would believe you? \n\nYou see as the ship passes on, hundreds of glinting rings dropping out over its side. Some further than you thought possible, others devastatingly close. One by one, they are refused by people invisible to you. Some are languidly reeled back in. The rest drag behind the boat like corpses.  \n\nThen, you are suddenly alone again. You tilt back, and look at the sky: a blank canvas for all of your imaginary, more pleasant, more fulfilling futures. There is a certain giddiness to this amnesia. You feel you are yourself an enormous, precious secret that no one will tell.\n\nSometimes, slivers of memory come back to you from being on the boat. The breathless anticipation of the new. Turning openly towards everything. Not being afraid of turning the corner. Feeling--really feeling--someone hug you. Believing in another person's love.\n\nA stranger's hand, ripping you from the dark. The noise of the wind as you were thrown over. Your face cracking against the water. \n\nNothing. Nothing.\n\nWas that you? You don't know. You think so. Maybe. \n\nI know it was you. I can't see you, but I can feel you. It's sad. It's almost unbearably sad. All of us so proud of our refusal, of taking 'responsibility'. All so proud and yet impossibly ashamed.\n\n[Giving up does not mean giving up on yourself. It means giving up the fiction that there is some honour or reality in doing things all by yourself. So many other people were responsible for you, and only by understanding the depth of their failure can you ever formulate a picture of what looking after yourself and other people actually is. Accepting responsibility for yourself is about understanding the limitations of your responsibility. Anyone who believes they are 100% responsible for what happens to them in life is living in a narcissistic fantasy world. They do not truly understand the meaning of the word.]\n\n   "], [9, "Meh....  I see this as a hallow sentiment and fundamentally untrue.

Usually, it is the person who has had every kind of support who is blind to that reality, and thinks it was all their 'hard work' that allowed them to look back on their past with a self-satisfied smile.\n\nAnd any sentence that begins with 'the harsh truth...' or 'the past is past...' is usually straight from the mouths of babes.\n\nImagine spending your life floating in water. It doesn't have to be deep, or cold. You're wearing your clothes, shoes, and socks, because it's a regular day. The shadows of monsters aren't sliding underneath your feet. You're just floating there. It might even be sunny. You might even stretch out onto your back and look up at the sky.\n\nEvery evening, you get a little nervous. You can see, on the horizon, a huge black-bellied ship approaching. Each time you see it, it seems threatening, but you watch it insistently, carefully, and wait for when it becomes clearer to you. Eventually, you notice the strips of coloured lights wrapped around the railings. A pleasant kind of music floats across the water. Friends, family--they're all up there, mingling among strangers. They're having a good time, and they haven't spotted you yet. Even though you know these people, there is a thumping anxiety in your chest. The water feels like a thick hand around your throat.\n\n'Hey!' Someone calls out to you. You don't know who. All you know now is that everyone is looking at you. And it's only now when your body starts to feel heavy, your clothes drag on your skin. It's as if somewhere deep below, a drain has cracked open, and is drawing you towards it.\n\nYou wave back, quickly. They turn to each other, confused. 'Are you okay?' someone asks.\n\n'Yes,' you say, slightly out of breath.\n\n'Are you sure?' they ask. You feel enraged. Enraged at them for asking twice: don't they trust you? Don't they listen to you? And enraged at yourself for being unable to say what you really want to: 'no.' \n\nWhat would they think of you then? That you were weak? And shameful?\n\n'Yes, really, I'm fine,' you shout back. Another smile, another act of parasitic deceit. Your stomach is full of worms. There's no way they'd accept you now--not since you've said yes. They would know you were lying to them. They would find, after interrogating and dissecting you, all of these little creatures that live inside you. How could they love that? How could they not feel disgusted?\n\nYou imagine them turning, vomiting into their napkins. Having spoiled the party, they toss you back over.\n\nYet, for an instant, their love makes you feel warm. They toss out a lifesaver, against your wishes. A perfect orange circle gliding out over the water. It doesn't even miss you. You realise in this moment that it's not being thrown to you, so much as it is, for today, returning to you.\n\nA patchwork of images comes back to you. Thousands of throws, thousands of repetitions of this moment. Your father looks older now. His hair is thinning. Your mother leans on the railing with her chin in her hand. Her wrists are thin. Her expression a smudge of disappointment and grief. Your friends, of which there used to be many, casually glance over the railing before turning back to their conversations.\n\nHow much longer will this go on? How much longer will they pass you by, before they, like you, slip into silence?\n\nThe agony of indecision is short but intense. Your chin is only just above the water. The suction below is strong, but equally strong is your desire to reach out. Perversely, you resist love, and kindness, and compassion, and obey your own self-hatred. Why do these people need to help me? Why can't I swim in by myself? They won't love me until I can take care of myself.\n\nSlowly, you rationalise the impossibility of being saved. The ring has drifted on. You have missed your chance. They must think you're pathetic. They must wonder whether you really love them, whether they really by your distant acts of affection. Even if you did get back--who's to say they would believe you? \n\nYou see as the ship passes on, hundreds of glinting rings dropping out over its side. Some further than you thought possible, others devastatingly close. One by one, they are refused by people invisible to you. Some are languidly reeled back in. The rest drag behind the boat like corpses.  \n\nThen, you are suddenly alone again. You tilt back, and look at the sky: a blank canvas for all of your imaginary, more pleasant, more fulfilling futures. There is a certain giddiness to this amnesia. You feel you are yourself an enormous, precious secret that no one will tell.\n\nSometimes, slivers of memory come back to you from being on the boat. The breathless anticipation of the new. Turning openly towards everything. Not being afraid of turning the corner. Feeling--really feeling--someone hug you. Believing in another person's love.\n\nA stranger's hand, ripping you from the dark. The noise of the wind as you were thrown over. Your face cracking against the water. \n\nNothing. Nothing.\n\nWas that you? You don't know. You think so. Maybe. \n\nI know it was you. I can't see you, but I can feel you. It's sad. It's almost unbearably sad. All of us so proud of our refusal, of taking 'responsibility'. All so proud and yet impossibly ashamed.\n\n[Giving up does not mean giving up on yourself. It means giving up the fiction that there is some honour or reality in doing things all by yourself. So many other people were responsible for you, and only by understanding the depth of their failure can you ever formulate a picture of what looking after yourself and other people actually is. Accepting responsibility for yourself is about understanding the limitations of your responsibility.
