", "id": "dahgfdt"}, {"comment": "What SpaceX is doing is a little different than building the Space industries' 'turbofan'. What they're doing is, instead of focusing on pushing the limit of human technology, they are taking already well understood and reliable technology and using it in a more effective way. This is true from their manufacturing process which mostly takes place inside of one building using advanced robotics, to their designs which use essentially the same propulsion technology as the first stage of the Saturn V and similar tankage, to they way they plan on actually operating their launch vehicles (by first cracking first stage re-usability then going further with more advanced designs). Too many failed space startup companies and even projects internal to well established space organizations attempt to reach well beyond current technology and end up floundering early. \n\n\nSpace Shuttle failed to lower the cost of space flight. Venture Star was cancelled before it was ever built because of problems with the lobed composite tank structures. The start up company Escape Dynamics has failed, even though they built a working prototype beamed power engine that achieved better-than-chemical-propulsion Isp on the order of 600 seconds, because of the massive cost of several giant beamed power arrays and the issues associated to that. \n\n\nSpaceX didn't start out by trying to build the Raptor engine, or use composite cryogenic tanks, or even booster re-usability. SpaceX started out by building a single-Merlin engine first stage that lifted a small Kestrel powered second stage, which won them a NASA contract once they successfully achieved orbit. Going form there, and building on their own experience, they built a new rocket that used a cluster of 9 Merlins on the first stage and one Merlin on the second. Once this vehicle was up and running they started to upgrade the engine thrust, rocket size and fuel capacity, and begin installing the hardware the first stage would need in order to be recoverable. At the same time improved production methods reduced the cost of producing each engine, as well as allowing a faster rate of engine production. Throughout this entire process SpaceX has managed to keep afloat by actually making money with their rocket launches while simultaneously using those launches for R&D.\n\n\nI'd say that the most important advancement SpaceX has achieved is their method of regarding technology requirements. They have proven that we don't *need* massive hydrogen fueled SSTO spaceplanes to lower the cost of space flight, we can just use good old kerosene gas-generator engines on rather conventional rocket stages. They've shown that if your design calls for one extreme advancement in propulsion technology or the other, you'd be better off just changing your design to not require that advancement instead of ramming your head into a wall right off the bat. It's also important to know that making a simpler but profitable design first will probably allow you to fund your more advanced 'dream project' while at the same time actually allowing you to continue to exist as a company. This is pretty much exactly what SpaceX has done, they started small with Falcon 1, moved up to Falcon 9 and Heavy, and in the near future plan on going beyond to build their 'dream project' of the ITS Booster and Spaceship. They wouldn't be able to do the ITS if it weren't for the lessons learned and the money earned over their last ~14 years of operation.

The Big Bang singularity simply implies that the universe's starting condition was one of infinite density.  It says **nothing** about how big that starting singularity was.  For all we know, the universe was an infinitely dense, infinitely large object.

There's a lot of science and engineering to do before a manned Mars mission is even worth planning.  Do you think that they knew what a lunar program would look like when they were given a deadline for getting to the Moon?  No, they started with Mercury to figure out how to get to space and get home.  Then Gemini to figure out how to actually do things in space.\n\nOrion is the Mars program's Mercury.  Without a platform to conduct science and test engineering principles in deep space, NASA can't design a spacecraft to make the journey to Mars and back.\n\n> The SLS is behind schedule and over budget.\n\nCitation needed.  Seriously.  All indicators point to its timeline being a-ok.  The budget *did* increase, but this was due to changes made midway through the program, many of which were mandated by congress.  It is to be expected, though.  All programs like this run over budget.\n\n> And even if the SLS somehow manages to fly, the manifest for Orion is vague and dull beyond a couple lunar flybys almost a decade from now.\n\nThis is necessary.  It is impossible to plot the future missions in our current political climate.  While vague, it does allow NASA to be flexible in the face of changing political goals.  The cool thing about SLS is that NASA *knows* they're getting it.  Once the cost of development has been paid, it'll be much easier for NASA to convince congress to allow them to build more rockets for future missions.\n\n> The most important aspect about Orion that almost no one discusses, however, is its absolute inadequacy for a long-duration crewed mission. It has an operational life of 21 days, when a trip to Mars at its closest approach takes at the very least 10 times that just to get there. Let's not even talk about supplies to sustain a crew of 4 for the 18 months a round trip would take. How is Orion going to take anyone to Mars? And why is no one asking NASA that?\n\nA little digging on your part could have answered that question.  NASA already has a few low-readiness ideas that they've presented.  These are technologies that need to be developed, and NASA needs a reliable deep-space craft to develop them.  Hence, Orion.\n\n> I said earlier that all this talk of Orion and Mars could be dangerous to NASA in the long term. NASA has to fight tooth and nail for its budget as it is, and they have to justify every cent they ask for. Some segments of the public think giving any money to NASA is a waste. You can't claim to be developing your Mars vehicle and then ask for more money to develop your actual Mars vehicle without some people jumping at your throat.\n\nOf course you can!  That's how Apollo worked!  NASA may have a lot of problems, but the single greatest decision that they've ever made is to be sure that NASA has facilities - and thus working voters - in more than half the states in the country.  This means that they have a vast amount of political leverage.  Many of the budget cuts over the years have been in cooperation with congress.  The administrators at NASA are no fools here.  If the budget is too high, either justify it, or give some of it up so you don't lose all of it.\n\n> At this point, I think it would be wiser for NASA to transition to a more scientific role, designing crewed and robotic missions, training astronauts and letting the private sector worry about hardware development. Announce a mission to Mars with a list of requirements and a timeline, and let companies compete to offer an adequate solution. (And yes, I'm aware the Senate has basically cornered NASA to continue development of the SLS to keep their districts happy and all that).\n\nThat would eventually be the death of NASA.  Without the large-scale jobs-creating endeavors that NASA engages in, their political powers evaporate, and they become an expensive line-item just asking to be slashed come budget time."], [8, "SLS is not behind schedule or over budget, at all. Yes it is going to \"manage to fly\", the flight hardware for EM-1 is being built right now.\n\nI think you need to take NASA PR with a grain of salt.

I thought r/space was better than this. Oh wait, look at that, less than 60% upvotes, faith in /r/space has been restored a bit!"]], [[{"comment": "So, let's dissect your arguments a little bit.\n\n> They talk about Mars, Orion and the SLS, but in reality NASA has no Mars architecture or even a concrete plan or timeline to get there.\n\nOf course not.  There's a lot of science and engineering to do before a manned Mars mission is even worth planning.  Do you think that they knew what a lunar program would look like when they were given a deadline for getting to the Moon?  No, they started with Mercury to figure out how to get to space and get home.  Then Gemini to figure out how to actually do things in space.\n\nOrion is the Mars program's Mercury.  Without a platform to conduct science and test engineering principles in deep space, NASA can't design a spacecraft to make the journey to Mars and back.\n\n> The SLS is behind schedule and over budget.\n\nCitation needed.  Seriously.  All indicators point to its timeline being a-ok.  The budget *did* increase, but this was due to changes made midway through the program, many of which were mandated by congress.  It is to be expected, though.  All programs like this run over budget.\n\n> And even if the SLS somehow manages to fly, the manifest for Orion is vague and dull beyond a couple lunar flybys almost a decade from now.\n\nThis is necessary.  It is impossible to plot the future missions in our current political climate.  While vague, it does allow NASA to be flexible in the face of changing political goals.  The cool thing about SLS is that NASA *knows* they're getting it.  Once the cost of development has been paid, it'll be much easier for NASA to convince congress to allow them to build more rockets for future missions.\n\n> The most important aspect about Orion that almost no one discusses, however, is its absolute inadequacy for a long-duration crewed mission. It has an operational life of 21 days, when a trip to Mars at its closest approach takes at the very least 10 times that just to get there. Let's not even talk about supplies to sustain a crew of 4 for the 18 months a round trip would take. How is Orion going to take anyone to Mars? And why is no one asking NASA that?\n\nA little digging on your part could have answered that question.  NASA already has a few low-readiness ideas that they've presented.  These are technologies that need to be developed, and NASA needs a reliable deep-space craft to develop them.  Hence, Orion.\n\n> I said earlier that all this talk of Orion and Mars could be dangerous to NASA in the long term. NASA has to fight tooth and nail for its budget as it is, and they have to justify every cent they ask for. Some segments of the public think giving any money to NASA is a waste. You can't claim to be developing your Mars vehicle and then ask for more money to develop your actual Mars vehicle without some people jumping at your throat.\n\nOf course you can!  That's how Apollo worked!  NASA may have a lot of problems, but the single greatest decision that they've ever made is to be sure that NASA has facilities - and thus working voters - in more than half the states in the country.  This means that they have a vast amount of political leverage.  Many of the budget cuts over the years have been in cooperation with congress.  The administrators at NASA are no fools here.  If the budget is too high, either justify it, or give some of it up so you don't lose all of it.\n\n> At this point, I think it would be wiser for NASA to transition to a more scientific role, designing crewed and robotic missions, training astronauts and letting the private sector worry about hardware development. Announce a mission to Mars with a list of requirements and a timeline, and let companies compete to offer an adequate solution. (And yes, I'm aware the Senate has basically cornered NASA to continue development of the SLS to keep their districts happy and all that).\n\nThat would eventually be the death of NASA.

But certain Congresscritters were opposed to \"wasting money on space\", and figured that cancelling NERVA would make the Mars project impossible.\n\n - Intially what became the Space Shuttle was a design based on the DynaSoar and related vehicles (by both US and USSR). This design is the direct ancestor if the present day Dream Chaser. It was going to be small, cheap, reusable, and based on existing tech. But NASA was about to lose funding even for that, and went to DOD for help. DOD needed a launch vehicle for the Keyhole spy satellites, and agreed to fund the Shuttle if it could be expanded to carry a crew and the satellites. The alternative meant NASA basically going out of business. So the Shuttle became the monster we know - no longer cheap, barely reusable (those tiles!), and requiring substantial new tech (those times!). In the process almost every advantage and cost savings that NASA had planned was sacrificed. The design constraints became almost impossible.\n\n - IMHO the loss of NERVA and the Saturn 5N was the tipping point where NASA lost its engineering focus and was forced into the role of \"whatever the Congess and President wants, that's what we'll do.\" - just another government agency. But even so, throughout all this the agency has always been staffed mostly by true believers, and always has kept a bunch of little projects going on the side, out of the glare of congressional hearings and publicity, with the not-always-obvious assistance of supporters in Congress.

The [recent loss of 3 ISS resupply launches](https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceflight/comments/3byskt/watch_russia_launch_crucial_space_station_cargo/csqt3gq) within an 8-month span is a good reminder of this fact.  By designing your spacecraft so that it takes several launches to construct, you greatly increase the risk that one of the launches will fail, delaying the mission.  Such a failure doesn't even have to be catastrophic.  Something as simple as a faulty fuel valve might cause the launch to be delayed for a month while repairs are made.  A delay might sound like a small obstacle, but combined with other factors, it could cause the loss of the entire mission.\n\nLaunch windows for interplanetary spaceflight open up for only a few months every couple years or so.  All segments of the spacecraft must be launched and assembled before the launch window closes, or the entire mission will fail.\n\nThe propellant for the interplanetary spacecraft is volatile; as soon as it is in orbit, it will start to boil away into space.  The longer it takes to assemble the spacecraft, the more fuel will be lost.  At some point, there will not be enough fuel left to complete the mission.  The whole spacecraft has to be assembled before that time, or the entire mission will fail.\n\nCompare this to an Apollo-style mission.  The spacecraft is launched on a single rocket.  Once it is in orbit, the mission can proceed without further delay or complication.  The spacecraft leaves Earth toward its destination, propelled by the upper stage of the same rocket which launched it in the first place.  It is very simple, with a high probability of success.\n\nTo go to Mars will surely require more payload than can be launched by any single rocket. The goal is to keep the number of launches to a minimum, and also to send the payload to the destination with the upper stage of the same rocket which launched it in the first place.  The added simplicity increases the reliability and probability of mission success.\n\nThere are lots of plans for Mars missions, but by far the most realistic and practical of them was designed by Dr. Robert Zubrin in the 1990s.  I urge you to listen to [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKQSijn9FBs) which he gives at the NASA Ames Facility, explaining his \"Mars Direct\" mission architecture.\n"], [1, "There have been various proposals along these lines. Alas, as with most human endeavours, the answer to the question \"why don't we...?\" is \"because *money*.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, pound-for-pound, a bigger launcher is cheaper. And assembling modules together adds expense in the form of docking ports and propellant for rendesvous and stuff like that. You'd need a very well-funded mission indeed for it to be worth doing that way, and so far there aren't many well-funded missions.\n\nOn a related note, I figured I'd throw in [a link to a company doing some innovative research into space-based structural assembly](http://www.tethers.com/SpiderFab.html).

All segments of the spacecraft must be launched and assembled before the launch window closes, or the entire mission will fail.\n\nThe propellant for the interplanetary spacecraft is volatile; as soon as it is in orbit, it will start to boil away into space.  The longer it takes to assemble the spacecraft, the more fuel will be lost.  At some point, there will not be enough fuel left to complete the mission.  The whole spacecraft has to be assembled before that time, or the entire mission will fail.\n\nCompare this to an Apollo-style mission.  The spacecraft is launched on a single rocket.  Once it is in orbit, the mission can proceed without further delay or complication.  The spacecraft leaves Earth toward its destination, propelled by the upper stage of the same rocket which launched it in the first place.  It is very simple, with a high probability of success.\n\nTo go to Mars will surely require more payload than can be launched by any single rocket. The goal is to keep the number of launches to a minimum, and also to send the payload to the destination with the upper stage of the same rocket which launched it in the first place.  The added simplicity increases the reliability and probability of mission success.\n\nThere are lots of plans for Mars missions, but by far the most realistic and practical of them was designed by Dr. Robert Zubrin in the 1990s.  I urge you to listen to [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKQSijn9FBs) which he gives at the NASA Ames Facility, explaining his \"Mars Direct\" mission architecture.\n", "id": "cy1vx0d"}, {"comment": "Good Post, I agree with him and I still think we need to go back to the days of the \"Space Cowboys\", winging it on primitive technology, taking bold risks, betting on courage and achieving amazing feats.

Alas, as with most human endeavours, the answer to the question \"why don't we...?\" is \"because *money*.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, pound-for-pound, a bigger launcher is cheaper. And assembling modules together adds expense in the form of docking ports and propellant for rendesvous and stuff like that. You'd need a very well-funded mission indeed for it to be worth doing that way, and so far there aren't many well-funded missions.\n\nOn a related note, I figured I'd throw in [a link to a company doing some innovative research into space-based structural assembly](http://www.tethers.com/SpiderFab.html).

Ones where we need to send a ship that's more massive than the biggest heavy lift launcher we have can put up in one shot.

But above that threshold we *must* assemble it from multiple launches because we don't have launchers with payload that large. We don't have the money available right now to do extraplanetary missions in the weight class that *requires* on-orbit assembly, and for missions in the weight class that don't require on-orbit assembly it's cheaper to launch them in one shot.\n\nSo the ultimate answer of \"why not\" *is* \"because money.\" The engineering details explain why certain approaches cost more than others, but there's no engineering reason why we couldn't do it either way. Just economic ones.\n\nWe *could* build a 1000kg Mars satellite out of 100kg modules launched independently, if we really wanted to. We don't want to, though, because it costs less to just launch the thousand-kilogram finished product in one shot. There's no *engineering* reason we couldn't but whoever's funding the mission would ask why they're wasting his money on a suboptimal approach like that and put a stop to it.\n\nWe *could* build a 1000 tonne Mars ship out of smaller modules (what's the current best heavy launcher we have, Delta IV Heavy? That gets 30 tonne modules to orbit so we'd need about thirty launches). There's no engineering reason stopping us.

Most deep-space probes use non-cryogenic propellants because they do rocket burns after long cruise periods.\n\nAgain, no engineering impossibility, just economic limits.

We show here the first evidence that the Milky Way experienced a generalised quenching of its star formation at the end of its thick disk formation \u223c9 Gyr ago. Elemental abundances of stars studied as part of the APOGEE survey reveal indeed that in less than \u223c2 Gyr the star formation rate in our Galaxy dropped by an order-of-magnitude. Because of the tight correlation between age and alpha abundance, this event reflects in the dearth of stars along the inner disk sequence in the [Fe/H]-[\u03b1/Fe] plane. Before this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the Milky Way was actively forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at a much lower level to form the thin disk. These events are very well matched by the latest observation of MW-type progenitors at high redshifts. In late type galaxies, quenching is believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion of gas. In our Galaxy, it occurred on a much shorter time scale, while the chemical continuity before and after the quenching indicates that it was not due to the exhaustion of the gas. While quenching is generally associated with spheroids, our results show that it also occurs in galaxies like the Milky Way, possibly when they are undergoing a morphological transition from thick to thin disks. Given the demographics of late type galaxies in the local universe, in which classical bulges are rare, we suggest further that this may hold true generally in galaxies with mass lower than or approximately M\u2217, where quenching could be directly a consequence of thick disk formation. We emphasize that the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be contemporaneous with, and related to, the formation of the bar. We sketch a scenario on how a strong bar may inhibit star formation. \n\nIt hasn't _stopped_, just slowed down dramatically."], [3, "Considering that the Sun is 4.6 billion years old, that most of the best-studied nearby stars have ages estimated to be a few billion years or less and there are many star clusters and star forming regions readily visible from the Earth with ages in the millions to hundreds of millions of years, the claim in the title, \"our galaxy stopped making new stars somewhere between 10 billion and 8 billion years ago\", is obviously wrong."], [4, "Are they trying to say there are no more nebulae in the galaxy?

We show here the first evidence that the Milky Way experienced a generalised quenching of its star formation at the end of its thick disk formation \u223c9 Gyr ago. Elemental abundances of stars studied as part of the APOGEE survey reveal indeed that in less than \u223c2 Gyr the star formation rate in our Galaxy dropped by an order-of-magnitude. Because of the tight correlation between age and alpha abundance, this event reflects in the dearth of stars along the inner disk sequence in the [Fe/H]-[\u03b1/Fe] plane. Before this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the Milky Way was actively forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at a much lower level to form the thin disk. These events are very well matched by the latest observation of MW-type progenitors at high redshifts. In late type galaxies, quenching is believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion of gas. In our Galaxy, it occurred on a much shorter time scale, while the chemical continuity before and after the quenching indicates that it was not due to the exhaustion of the gas. While quenching is generally associated with spheroids, our results show that it also occurs in galaxies like the Milky Way, possibly when they are undergoing a morphological transition from thick to thin disks. Given the demographics of late type galaxies in the local universe, in which classical bulges are rare, we suggest further that this may hold true generally in galaxies with mass lower than or approximately M\u2217, where quenching could be directly a consequence of thick disk formation. We emphasize that the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be contemporaneous with, and related to, the formation of the bar.

But basics like knowing when what it is and when useful are more likely to stick. That way when someone is in a situation where they do need to know it, they can look it up and relearn it. If you don't know why it's used, you won't even be able to know when you need to look it up.\n\nThe lack of \"why do we have to know this?\" is the big problem with math's classes for example. I did years of calculus at high school, then more with higher education. The chain rule, quadratic equation, blah, blah blah. All forgotten after I graduated.\n\nI might have done a lot of it, but I didn't even know what calculus actually was until years later when I though to look it up.

For example, if NASA wants to pay SpaceX to put 6 astronauts on the Moon for 6 months, and bring along with them the survey equipment, science experiments, supplies and machinery they'll need, there's no reason SpaceX would refuse. In fact I can see something similar to the Commercial Crew Program, where NASA awards SpaceX a contract to do, say, ten flights to the surface of the Moon, the first three being unmanned with cargo only, and subsequent flights rotating out crew members and supplying additional cargo. Such a 'Commercial Moon Base Contract' would be far cheaper than any Moon base architecture currently on the table, and would result in an actual facility on the Moon with at least some ISRU capability (for example, printing large inhabitable structures from fused Lunar regolith, harvesting oxygen by electrolysis of alumina), as well as affording a much more in depth and large scale survey of the resources on and under the surface of the Moon. For example, what if we find out that ten meters under the surface there are actually vast amounts of hydrated minerals, meaning water on the Moon isn't as rare as we now think? It would be a game changer. Maybe we'll find minerals containing carbon as well. Maybe we just confirm present theories that say the Moon is a very dry place.

For example, if NASA wants to pay SpaceX to put 6 astronauts on the Moon for 6 months, and bring along with them the survey equipment, science experiments, supplies and machinery they'll need, there's no reason SpaceX would refuse. In fact I can see something similar to the Commercial Crew Program, where NASA awards SpaceX a contract to do, say, ten flights to the surface of the Moon, the first three being unmanned with cargo only, and subsequent flights rotating out crew members and supplying additional cargo. Such a 'Commercial Moon Base Contract' would be far cheaper than any Moon base architecture currently on the table, and would result in an actual facility on the Moon with at least some ISRU capability (for example, printing large inhabitable structures from fused Lunar regolith, harvesting oxygen by electrolysis of alumina), as well as affording a much more in depth and large scale survey of the resources on and under the surface of the Moon. For example, what if we find out that ten meters under the surface there are actually vast amounts of hydrated minerals, meaning water on the Moon isn't as rare as we now think? It would be a game changer. Maybe we'll find minerals containing carbon as well. Maybe we just confirm present theories that say the Moon is a very dry place.

We didn't stop exploring space beyond Low Earth Orbit because it was too expensive or unsustainable.  NASA has failed to venture beyond Low Earth Orbit since Apollo because of poor decisions on how to spend the significant funds NASA has been given every year since the end of Apollo.\n\nIf we look at [NASA's budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA) ourselves, we can begin to understand the problem.  Since the beginning of the Shuttle Era, NASA has been funded at 70% the level it was funded, on average, during the Apollo Era (using inflation-adjusted constant dollars).  Total NASA expenditures during the 13 years of the Apollo Era (from 1961 to 1973) total 328 billion dollars (constant 2014 dollars.)  Today, NASA spends that much every 18 years.  Since Apollo ended (1974), NASA has spent 770 billion dollars, or 2.3 times as much as Apollo, without a single Moon landing to show for it.  NASA has plenty of money.  The problem is that it is wasted.\n\nApollo *did* establish a sustainable foundation for future development.  It created and flight-proved two capable spacecraft and two launch vehicles.  By continuing to use the Apollo Spacecraft and Saturn Launch Vehicles, we could have, using the Shuttle Era budget, flown 6 missions per year, two of them to the Moon, every year for the past 40 years.  Former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin makes the analysis in [this article.](http://aviationweek.typepad.com/space/2007/03/human_space_exp.html)  Furthermore, NASA was planning to use the Saturn V to take humans into interplanetary space for a Venus flyby mission.  See the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Venus_Flyby) and this [mission concept animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA_tdIKu-HQ)\n\nIf you are curious as to the continuing history of NASAs dreams failing to come true, I encourage you to have a look at [this summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/3vjoi1/what_would_really_happen_if_the_nasa_budget_was/cxoyyjj) I composed earlier.

[There just wasn't any real sustained popular support for continuing Moon missions](https://launiusr.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/exploding-the-myth-of-popular-support-for-project-apollo/). There was support for *beating the Russians*, sure, but once that was done the general public was no longer interested in \"more of the same.\"\n\nYou can see this even here in /r/space. I've found it a pretty reliable pattern, whenever a return to the Moon is proposed there'll be people in the comments arguing that we've \"been there and done that\" and that the Moon is uninteresting or useless.\n\nIf we want a sustainable presence in space I don't think we can rely on getting large amounts of funding for specific projects over long periods. We need to focus on short-term steps that are cheap, easy, and most importantly that contribute toward making future steps even *cheaper* and *easier*. I don't see NASA's Mars plans doing that.\n\nA lot of that kind of thing is sort of boring, I admit.

Isn't that what SpaceX is trying to do? NASA doesn't want to waste money either, otherwise they wouldn't award private companies like SpaceX and just continue making their own expensive rockets.

Space exploration is one of the most important goals of humanity, if not the most important one. We literally waste BILLIONS of dollars into stuff that is not important, let's cut that, not space exploration.

A trip to the moon is under two weeks. A trip to mars would be around 2 years. It takes six to nine months to travel there. Then you have to spend 3 months on the planet or in orbit in order for the planets to be aligned right for the return trip.

No point in sending astronauts to mars if they can hardly walk when they get there. Even in the ISS where they have a decent amount of room it's hard to stay in shape. The astronauts that went to the moon basically sat in their seats the entire way. Not much room to move around. A spacecraft for travel to mars would have to be quite large just to take all the necessary food and have room for exercise and other stuff to keep them busy for the long journey.  \n  \nThe other problem is that there is no bail out plan.

It needs better radiation shielding since the crew will be exposed to interplanetary radiation a lot longer than Moonbound crew would.

To make anything that comes from Earth fall into the sun, you have to cancel out that 30 kilometers per second first. In rocketry terms, you need 30 km/s \"delta-v\", which is a lot. And it turns out that the amount of reaction mass that needs to be expelled by a rocket to accelerate, [rises exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation#/media/File:Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation.svg) with the desired delta-v.", "id": "czoz97r"}, {"comment": "I'm not sure if you fully understand gravity, so here's a quick lesson. \n\nLet's start with some super basic physics, when you throw a ball up, what happens? It comes back down. Now throw it infront of you and up, it falls and took longer to hit the ground than when you threw it straight up. That's gravity fucking with your ball. To get into an orbit, you're gonna have to throw it faster than gravity can pull it to the ground, essentially making it fall faster sideways than it falls down. This is an orbit. A low orbit around earth is, off the top of my head, 8km/s I believe. You threw that ball so fast sideways that it's no longer falling down. \n\nNow if you want the ball back, you would have to find a way to slow it down, so that gravity can have it in it's reigns. Falling faster down than sideways. Like dropping it from space. At 2km/s.  Now let's scale that up to the sun. The sun is huge, and really far away, and you threw your ball so hard sideways it went on an escape trajectory from earth. You threw it so far it's going faster than earth's gravity can keep you at all. Now you're orbiting the sun, at, again off the top of my head, 20km/s. That's insanely fast. And if you wanted to incinerate your ball in the scorching hells of the sun, (that's not actually how it works, there is no fire on the sun) you need to slow down enough to let gravity pull you down faster than you can go sideways. You would need to find a way to slow down 20km/s. \n\nThe most powerful rocket ever built (the Saturn V) has about 16km/s it can pull off I believe, that may be slightly off but it's somewhere around there. So even if you had the most powerful rocket ever built on a solar orbit, with no payload, (what the rocket carries into space) it would still not be able to slow down enough to hit the sun. \n\nApologies if you at all felt like I was making fun or insulting you with that, I wasn't sure what you knew or didn't know so I made it as simple as I could.

Black holes tend to be very small, and because of their distance, well below the pixel size of our telescopes. Therefore, we cannot see their nothingness.\n\nHowever, we can see the effect that black holes have on their surrounding (on a wider scale). Gas orbits around them, heats up at it gets closer (stronger forces, higher velocities, more friction, hence higher temperatures) and emits electromagnetic radiation in a way that nothing else but black holes can do. Detecting the emission of the accretion disk (that's how it's called) is one of several ways of detecting black holes. Even if you cannot resolve the disk spatially (everything is in one single pixel), you can use spectroscopy to determine the density, temperature and chemistry of the disk. Black holes are so powerful that they heat up gas to insane temperatures that can be detected by X or gamma ray telescopes. Nothing that we know can compete with that, so whether you detect that stuff, you're pretty sure to have found a black hole.\n\n", "id": "d4hspye"}]]], "4w9wb8": ["Can moon orbit change incase gravity on Earth is less for a long period of time and can it be that the Earth would rotate >more< with the moons rotation around the Earth?", "2016-08-05 15:15:42", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/4w9wb8/can_moon_orbit_change_incase_gravity_on_earth_is/", [[3, "My best guess:\n\nIf Earth were to suddenly \"have\" more or less gravity, the Moon's orbit would indeed change.

Also from memory, I think that the countdown of fuel was to the abort point, not the actual fuel remaining. ", "id": "d5y0v1r"}, {"comment": "Absolutely correct. When NASA had a chance to really pour over the telemetery, it was determined that the Apollo 11 crew definitely had significantly more fuel left aboard at touchdown in the Descent Stage than the callouts we heard during the landing seemed to show. This was even appreciated as being the case during the final approach & landing itself. \n\nThe Apollo 11 crew, during the final approach and touchdown phase, certainly did not have a lot of fuel to play around with, but the truth is that because of built-in contingencies in the flightplan and known \"fuel slosh\" issues that would slightly mess with the real-time tank fuel level measurements and the illumination of the \"low quantity light\", they definitely had considerably more than 15 to 25 seconds remaining in the tanks (which many in the public erroneously believed to be the case).\n\nFirstly, the Apollo missions had a safety margin built into their fuel loadout calls during landing - requiring that the LM had at least six full seconds of 100% thrust available in the DPS (Descent Propulsion System) tanks left over after the \"zero % fuel\" call (what was known as \"bingo fuel\") was reached. This six seconds of full throttle capability at the 0% callout was there in order to allow the crew to perform a stabilization maneuver to nullify any forward/backward and/or lateral velocities and execute an APS (Ascent Propulsion System) abort. Six full seconds of 100% thrust was certainly not required for an APS abort during the landing phase (the LM did not hover or land on 100% thrust - the real throttle percentage figure was much lower than that - closer to 50% throttle), and because the thrust percentage needed to successfully abort via the APS was considerably lower than the 100% six-second margin provided, the actual contingency flight time given for the abort maneuver (or to continue powered descent at much less than full throttle) using the DPS engine was in reality greater than six seconds.\n\nAfter the flight, telemetry examination determined that due to \"fuel slosh\" issues (fuel moving around in the DPS tanks), the \"low propellant\" light in the LM cockpit illuminated between 30 and 40 seconds earlier than it should have - which erroneously signified that the fuel quantity was lower than it actually was.\n\nInternally, NASA was well aware that the Apollo 11 LM landed with somewhere between 40 to 70 seconds of usable descent fuel left in the DPS tanks. The reason the public quickly latched onto the \"15-25 seconds of fuel left over\" claim was because of the radio calls from Mission Control coming in over the open loop during landing, which by design, did not take the well appreciated contingency load of fuel in the tanks and the fuel tank slosh issues into account.\n\nHad Armstrong and Aldrin been at \"bingo fuel\" with just a couple dozen feet to go before touchdown in a stable attitude, NASA would not have ordered an APS abort and Armstrong and Aldrin most certainly would not have conducted an abort on their own, because they were all well aware of the contingency load and slosh issues that gave them *at least* another 20 seconds of throttle and engine life to reliably play with to execute the landing.

Also, the temperature even at the poles on Venus is exactly the same as it is everywhere else, the atmosphere is just so thick and rotating so fast that the heat gets transferred everywhere and evens out to a basically ubiquitous level. That's not even close to the hardest thing about trying to build a floating city above Venus though. \n\n\nAs for your other points; \n\n\nBeing able to move asteroids to Venus for useful building materials would be beneficial to this effort. \n\n\n'Housing on Venus' makes no sense. It's not like people will be living on Venus and commuting to work on Earth or Mars or Mercury every day. Housing is going to be built wherever people have their livelihoods, not across the solar system. If Venus has no livelihood, which it probably won't, having no access to the surface, then housing has no reason to be there, and thus won't be there. \n\n\nManufacturing things on Venus because they require high temperatures makes no sense economically. For the amount of cost savings you'd get by using the ambient heat at the surface, you'd be burning hundreds of times the mass of chemical fuel it would take to generate that heat just to transport the materials there and the products back to where they're needed. \n\n\nLet's compare all this to Mars, since the OP mentioned it. On Mars, you actually have access to the surface, so sending huge amounts of bulk raw material is not necessary to build a colony. There's lots of water in the form of ice and hydrated minerals that can be used for making rocket fuel as well as feeding a biosphere in the colony. The martian surface is more than capable of sustaining all the housing needs of all the millions of colonists that will eventually live there. There's plenty of solar power and nuclear fuels available that can supply enough electricity to sustain a large industry including the manufacture of materials that require large amounts of heat. Also, Mars is closer to the asteroid belt, and moving an asteroid from the belt to orbit the planet would take far less delta-V compared to doing the same at Venus.

When it comes to intermediately reduced gravity and how it affects people long term, we literally do not have any data on the subject. The most common theory and the best supported one is that people are fine at a range of G both slightly above and slightly below Earth gravity, then there's a second regime where the body makes a few adjustments but soon reaches a homeostasis again and the person remains healthy indefinitely (until they age of course), and finally an outer range where the body's systems never reach a steady state, and continuous degradation is inevitable unless certain activities are performed often and regularly. All we know for sure about where those limits lay is that in 1G we're all good and at zero G our muscles and bones and cardiovascular systems and a few other things all start to degrade if we don't do things like exercise regularly and take supplements etc. The limit between normal function and small adjustment may be around 0.9G, or it may be around 0.2G, we don't know. The Moon's gravity may be strong enough to keep us healthy but we aren't betting on it. Venus' gravity might not be strong enough to keep us healthy but we think it is. Mars is in the grey area, but there's still a very good chance that while people born and raised on Mars may end up taller and slimmer than their parents, the low gravity is not going to be a deal breaker. Like I said however, we should definitely still be looking to do experiments on long term habitation in reduced G environments to learn more. A Mars base, a Moon base, a floating research station on Venus (definitely the hardest of the three) would all help us to understand how our bodies respond to reduced gravity. \n\n\nPersonally I hope that humans can live and develop healthily all the way down to slightly below the Moon's gravity, because that would open up many worlds in our solar system as viable candidates for self sustaining populations of an interplanetary civilization. Worlds that don't have enough gravity to sustain healthy humans could be used for things like industry and energy production centers for colonies built in space around those objects, like massive rotating space stations that house millions arranged in a massive orbiting ring around Neptune or Uranus for example. Even small kuiper belt objects could be colonized in this fashion, the tiny Gs making rocket launch very easy and keeping material transport costs low enough to not be a barrier to such a civilization.

Mercury however is a blasted landscape being scoured by the sun in a ~700 hour long day, followed by a freezing cold 700 hour long night. Mercury has almost no water ice except for a few small, deep craters that never get hit by sunlight, never had active geology like Mars did, and has no atmosphere except for an extremely tenuous cloud of ions that get knocked off of the surface by solar radiation.
