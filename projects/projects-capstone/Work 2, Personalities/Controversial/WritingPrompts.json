Sure, I've heard the legends like everyone else of a time when knowing such things was all but a mystery... but that seems like such a faraway thought now. A world of where the death of someone being unknown simply doesn't register. How did people plan thier lives? How did they know when to grieve and what to make a priority?\n\nLove is a funny thing. Those who call love boundless are ignorant of reality. Love if anything, is predictable... I've known since our wedding day nearly 8 years ago... since before our honeymoon, the birth of our child... all our trials and tribulations. Nothing but today's date has been burned into my mind. October 21, 2016. Since our first meeting, today has been that Shadow on our horizon. My horizon. She ofcourse can never know what today means or that she is only so much longer in this world.\n\nI've done nothing but dread the passage of time. The closeness. The Bond made... only to be snatched away far to soon. In the start I was hopeful, I was positive and dedicated myself to making these years the best for her, for us... our family. But as time passed that desire has soured to resentment... this time looking back feels all wasted... I try not to place the burden on her, but sometimes I can't help but feel it's her fault. \n\nToday is the last day I'll be married... today I am so close to a sense of *freedom*? No... that isn't right. But it feels so long I've dreamt of this day and planned... manuavered finances and cheque books. I'll have enough for a funeral, and a solid 3 months of living expenses... then the boy and I will move on. We can have the life I've  always dreamt for us. \n\nThinking of Lewis now, where is he? He should have been up 20 minutes ago for school. I approach his room and hear a soft sobbing - he's seen it to. Even at the age of 4 he understands what the digits in our eyes represent. This age has been the hardest. Keeping him from blurting out what he sees...\n\nI open his door and move to sit beside his bed, as he turns to me I'm confused... my stomach feels empty all at once. The digits... his eyes... they read a mere 130 seconds from now. I rub my own eyes and ask my son \"what's wrong buddy?\" He says nothing... and only looks past me... looking to the doorway and his mother. To the raised gun in her hand and the tears running down her face... I can hear nothing now. I see only the outline of her mouth move- making the sounds of \"I'm sorry... I am sorry\" as the firing pin clicks back and a deafening sound shakes me from the daze... my chest feels wet. Slumping beside my son, I'm shaken again by the firing of the gun... as my wife steps toward us, she leans in and I watch as the digits slowly count down. She kisses my forehead and holds me close, I see the gun raise a 3rd time, but this time to herself. She runs her finger tips down my eyes and my world is turned black.

I am aware first of a sense of rushing. My limbs are moving with tense repetition, jerkily and swiftly. I am grabbing things and transferring them around a room. A smooth metal hanger rests in my hands, and I slide cloth onto it quickly, hooking it onto a metal rod. I do this over and over until the pile of clothes before me diminishes as they are placed in what I come to understand is their proper spot. I fling the bedclothes over the bed, gather scraps of paper and pile them neatly on a desk. I vacuum, I scrub, I wash. I grasp a small electronic device and rapidly tap its electronic keyboard, sending some kind of message. I am excited! Oh I am very excited!\n\nI glaze at myself in a mirror briefly and feel a sudden dread. I become aware I am hideously unpresentable. I stomp into a washing chamber, shame and self loathing rushing over me with the water. I scrub my hair, face, legs, buttocks, and nether regions. I slowly draw a light plastic razor over a great deal of my skin, cutting smooth paths through the foam. I towel off and rub cream all over my body, spritzing sweet smelling liquids around me. I address myself in the mirror once again. I am resolute. \n\nMy hands find liquid and solid cakes of colour, and I apply them to my face meticulously for a long time. I then comb through my hair and hold a machine which blows hot air onto my head for an even longer time. I apply hot metal tools to my dry hair, and finally leave to return to where I have hung my many coloured cloths. I select two, and put them on my body and take them off again and again. I am very worried about my appearance and am aware I must hurry. My electronic device beeps and I type another message. Glancing at myself once more, I am both disappointed and accepting. The ambivalence I feel is confusing, and leaves a heavy anxiety in my chest.\n\nComing outside, I see a young man sitting the driver\u2019s seat of a small car. He is wearing dark sunglasses and a white collared shirt. I feel a fluttering deep inside my gut, and smile as I get into the seat of the car beside him. He smiles back and I feel him looking at my clothes and body. He says; \u201cYou look nice.\u201d I say \u201cThanks.\u201d I feel uncomfortable and start talking quickly and asking many questions, and playing with the radio. He laughs and responds but talks less than I do. \n\nHe drives up a long asphalt private road, parking at a house. We both get out of the car and situate ourselves inside, on soft cushioned furniture. He turns on an appliance with a projection of a recording of talking people, and pulls me to him. I lay on his arm and shoulder, trying not to talk too much.\n\nSuddenly the young man leans toward me, and takes my face in his hands.  His warm thumbs part my mouth as he dips his head to mine, scraping his sharply shorn facial hair against my jaw, and sliding his wet tongue in my mouth. He moans, and backing away slightly, he tells me I smell nice. My heart is beating very quickly, and I tell him he does too. His body feels large and angular under mine, as he pulls me on top of him. He is smashing his body against mine in a way that is rough and I don\u2019t like it but it is difficult to slow him down. I am having a hard time breathing between the kissing and the pulling and eventually I break free and swipe my mouth with the back of my hand, saying I need to go to the washroom. I climb off him and go to the bathroom, running water over my burning mouth and jaw as I take a quick drink.\n\nWhen I return to the room he is in, he is sitting upright, peering into his electronic device. He puts it down beside him on the table and asks if I want anything as he leaves the room. I say no thank you. He returns with glasses of juice, and sets them on the table. \u201cI thought we were going out tonight,\u201d I say to him. I feel annoyed and claustrophobic. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being here with me?\u201d he asks, and I don\u2019t know what to say, so I laugh. We return to watching the projection of talking people. He laughs often. He pulls me to him and begins kissing me again. He is more gentle this time. I feel the fluttering deep inside again and a sense of pride comes over me. \u201cHe\u2019s mine,\u201d I am thinking, and this thought gives me pleasure.  I feel good about who I am. I feel attractive and powerful, suddenly. We continue kissing and disrobing each other, and entwine until we are satisfied. \n\nHe leaves the room to wash up as I lay on my stomach on the cushioned furniture. His electronic device on the table in front of me hums.  I sit up quickly and glance around, before snatching it from the table. I read the message on the screen quickly and see illustrations of hearts and lips, the meaning coming to me at once. I place it down as an enormous rush of rage and shame fills my chest. My heart hammers in my ears. I pull on my clothes with shaking limbs as my thoughts spin wildly. I want to escape \u2013I have to leave. He returns to the room and sees me: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks. I do not look at him. I desperately attempt to hide my true feelings and say; \u201cI don\u2019t feel well. I want to go home.\u201d \n\nI gaze out the window of the car, head turned away from him, and say little. He speaks more than me this time. My chest feels as if it is constricted, and breathing is difficult. My eyes sting with the agony of suppressed sobs, my throat burning and choked. As soon as the car stops he turns to speak to me but I scramble up from the seat and slam the door behind me, walking as quickly as I can to the door of my building in front of me, hot liquid tears already streaming down my face, my mouth wrenched into a deep gash of horror.  \n\nAs I hear the door close behind me with a metallic click, I slide to the floor as the wind explodes from my lungs in a deep gasp. The humiliation I feel is utterly consuming. I feel as if I\u2019ve been shot. The pain goes on and on, deeper and deeper. I am alone, horrified, and full of hatred. As I struggle to understand the day\u2019s events, my hatred turns inward. \u201cYou are so stupid. You are so stupid. How could you be so stupid?\u201d The thoughts come over and over as my body seizes in agony.\n\nI come up sputtering as the doctor holds me down with a firm, cold hand. \n\n\u201cSettle down now Unit. Be patient. The Simulation will leave you now.\u201d\n\nMy face is hot as I gasp to suck in air. All at once I feel all of the pain leave my body. I have no more chest constriction, no blocked throat, no sore and wet eyes and face. I feel no more of the wracking pain shocks. I moan in pure pleasure at the relief. I lie still, trembling and weak.\n\n\u201cYou can sit up now, dear Unit,\u201d the doctor says smoothly.\n\nI sit up slowly and turn to face him. \n\n\u201cStarting at the beginning.

She had moved my Halo Master chief figure and for that I will forever hate her.\n\nAs I was inspecting my 3 year old apartment trying to figure out the rights and the wrongs, Karen pulled me on to the sofa on my right and started laughing at my mildly shocked expressions.\n\nI was waiting for her laughter to die out to explain that it was all a mistake when she put a finger on top of my lips as soon as I opened them.\n\n\"I know how you are and how you keep your emotions under control.

The train slowly made its way up the first, biggest hill, and I felt my stomach being left further and further behind.  With each foot that we ratcheted along, I knew with more and more certainty that I'd made a massive mistake.  I could see the drop-off, the disaster, growing closer-\n\n-and I couldn't do a thing about it.\n\nNow, sitting in my bed and staring at my phone's glowing screen in the darkness, I felt that same pit opening up in my stomach, that same sense of disaster.\n\n\"Oh, shit,\" I murmured to myself.  Then again, louder: \"Shit!  Shit!\"\n\nQuick, is there any way to stop a message in the process of sending?  To Googl- no, too late.  It's sent.  \"Delivered\" popped up at the bottom of the screen.\n\nI stared at the word, praying that it wouldn't change.  Maybe she'd gone to bed, maybe she fell asleep with her phone pressed against her face, up too late talking to me, a little tipsy from the night's drinking-\n\nIt changed.\n\n\"Read 11:38 PM\"\n\nOh no.\n\nI leapt out of bed, cursing as my not-quite-awake feet tingled underneath me and wobbled, and sprinted down the hall.  As a senior, I'd earned my own single room in the old, creaky fraternity house, but Aaron still shared his room with Boomer.  I knew that Boomer was likely still out at the bars, but Aaron had wandered back a half hour earlier.\n\n\"Whazzup?\" he'd slurred, leaning into my room while holding onto the doorframe as if it was the only thing keeping him upright.\n\nI had sat up in bed, looked over at him.  \"Hey, you made it back from the bars!  Alive and alone, as usual!\"\n\n\"That's mean,\" he pouted, but he still came further into my room.  We'd traded insults back and forth for years; we both knew the flow of things.  \"How's your night been?  Stuck here, probably jerking it a bit to some nasty porn?\"\n\n\"If that's how you describe studying, then yes,\" I said, gesturing at the open textbooks spread out on my bed.  \"Texting Alice a bit.\"\n\nHe frowned.  \"Alice - she's that girl in your anatomy class, right?  The one that had all the guys hooting and hollering when she came over and put her anatomy on display?\"\n\nI grimaced, remembering that.  \"We're just friends.\"\n\n\"But you'd like to be more,\" Aaron guessed, keen despite the alcohol dulling his senses.  He grinned at the look of discomfort on my face.  \"Oh come on, dude, she's perfect for you.  Smart, knows all that same science stuff that you love, and goddamn, have you seen that chest?  I couldn't stop staring- ow!\"\n\nHe yelped because I threw my pencil at him.  \"Out!\" I commanded, pointing to the door.\n\n\"I'm just saying, dude,\" he insisted as he retreated.  \"You need to just go for it.  Make that move.  Sweep her off her feet, into your bed.  With your nerdiness, she's the best you'll ever land.\"\n\nI closed the door firmly behind him - and then sank back down in my bed.  Back to studying, I told myself.  My fingers, however, quickly strayed back to my phone.  Back to texting Alice.\n\nI didn't want to think about what Aaron had said, not the least because it was all true.  Alice really would be perfect with me, but she'd never see it, never go for me.  She was that cute, smart little blonde girl who seemed to attract success like an aura, wore it around her shoulders like a cloak.  She'd end up with some six-foot CEO who could buy her a yacht and a mansion, clinging to his chiseled arm and making the rest of us envious as we stared up the mountain of success at them, the figures on the peak.\n\nSure, I made her laugh - and I remembered that one night when, both of us yawning after a late-night study session that devolved into binge watching Happy Endings on Hulu, we snuggled together.  I could still smell the faint scent of cherries in her shampoo, remembered her warmth against me.\n\nI wanted that, and because I ached so strongly for her, I knew that I could never have her.  It wasn't meant to be.\n\nI heard my phone buzz.  \"Good night, hope the test doesn't murder you,\" she had sent me.\n\nI quickly keyed out a reply.  \"I'll live thru,\" I typed in, my finger already flying towards the send key.\n\nIt was then that it happened.\n\nEven as I pushed send, unable to stop that impulse traveling through my hand and down to my fingertip, I saw autocorrect jump in.  \"I'll live thru\" shifted, became \"I love you\".  \n\nAnd then the message was away, too late for me to respond.\n\nNow, bursting into Aaron's room without knocking, I gasped for breath.  \"Aaron, help!  I accidentally told her that I-\"\n\nI paused, averting my eyes as Aaron scrambled to haul his pants up, his screen still displaying a buxom lady moaning as she touched herself.  \"Dude, knock!\" he groaned.\n\nI laughed, but even this sight wasn't enough to distract me from my woes.  \"Aaron, I texted her that I love her!\"\n\n\"What?\"  Half-done-up belt forgotten, he turned and stared at me.  \"That isn't what I meant when I said you should go for it!  Start with coffee!\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to!\" I wailed.  \"It was autocorrect!  But she's read it!  What do I do?  What do I say?  Should I go over to her house and apologize?  She's only a block up the street-\"\n\nAaron stepped forward and slapped me, which I needed.  \"Thanks,\" I said, rubbing at my cheek and trying not to think about what that hand had touched before it hit my face.\n\n\"No problem.\"  He sighed.  \"What did she say?\"\n\nI checked the phone.  \"Nothing.  She read it, and then nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, damn.\"  He sank back down in his chair, noticed that his porn video was still playing, paused it.  I tried not to look at the face of the woman - or any other part of her - on display on the screen.  \"I think you have to go over there.\"\n\n\"Right, and apologize-\"\n\n\"No!\"  He stood up again, his eyes shining.  \"You need to own it!  This wasn't on purpose, but this could be your chance!  Wouldn't you rather know if the two of you have a shot, instead of wondering forever?\"\n\n\"Well, I-\"\n\n\"No, you would.  Now, go!  Get downstairs!\"  And even as I protested, he pushed me out of his room, down the stairs, down to the main room of our fraternity house!\n\nEven at this hour, a couple guys lounged about on the couch, watching late night television.  They turned and looked at the two of us, but Aaron didn't even pause.  He kept pushing me towards the front door.\n\n\"But I don't know what to say to her!\" I wailed, as he shoved me forward.\n\n\"Say the truth!  Tell her that you're sorry you came on a bit strong, it was autocorrect, but you really do like her and want to take her out for a drink!  Tell her the truth!\"  He gave me one last shove, and my hand landed on the doorknob.\n\nI pulled the door open.\n\nAnd Alice stood there on the other side, her hand still raised to knock.\n\nThe air drained from my lungs, that sinking feeling in my stomach once again.  \"Alice,\" I breathed out, and then ran out of oxygen.\n\n\"Hi,\" she said back, her voice barely audible.  \"I just- I wanted to- I mean, I didn't know that you-\"\n\nWe both stared at each other.  The guys on the couch stared at us.  Everyone was frozen - except for Aaron.\n\n\"Dude,\" he hissed at me in a whisper that everyone could hear within a mile.  \"Kiss her!\"\n\nI couldn't respond, but I felt heat creeping up into my cheeks.  And, amazingly, I saw a blush spread across Alice's beautiful, smart face as well!  Her eyes kept looking back into mine, bright, almost imploring me.  \n\nSlowly, clumsy as a newborn colt, I stepped forward.  I slid my arms around her, and she pressed forward against me.  \"Alice,\" I murmured, still not quite able to bring myself to do it, to commit.  \"That text, it was-\"\n\nShe kissed me before I could finish the sentence.\n\nFlashbulbs burst around me, inside my eyelids, as fireworks exploded in my brain.  I heard a clink next to me as Aaron's pants, barely held up after I burst in on him in his room, gave up the ghost and dropped to the floor.  The guys on the couch behind us all hooted and hollered, making monkey noises at us.\n\nI didn't care about any of it.  I kissed Alice back, loving the feel of her in my arms.  \n\nAnd that's the funny thing about rollercoasters, isn't it?  You go on it despite, or perhaps because, you're so terrified at the beginning.

This  has got to be some joke right? I read back the last text I sent to her. To my utter disbelief, my phone had autocorrected the sarcastic 'I hate you Karen' I had typed to 'I love you Karen'. The text I had gotten in return was even more astonishing. Karen loved me? The asshole guy who has almost no friends and puts logic over everything? \n\"I swear\" I sent as I was typing out 'it was an autocorrect'. But before I could send this one, she replied \n\"I swear too\"\nThis is not happening. This has got to be some joke. I'm being thrust into something I absolutely despise and that too with Karen? Karen has got to be the absolute opposite of me. She was over energetic, optimistic and most of all, ever smiling while me? I barely smiled, took precautions wherever possible and believed in energy conservation.\nEven if i were to give it a chance, there was a 97% possibility that it would end in no more than 2 weeks.\n\"I need to go. Something important came up. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight.\" I typed out as fast as I could, double checking to see if my stupid phone didn't autocorrect something again. \nI tapped send and as soon as I saw the delivered sign, I turned off my phone's wifi and put it away on the side table. \nI tried my best to fall asleep but the situations that would play out tomorrow didn't leave my mind alone. \n\nAfter waking up from a troubled sleep, I checked out my phone for messages out of instinct.\n\"Oh. I wished you would stay. Goodnight. I love you\" I read out in a sleepy voice.\nToday was gonna be a bad day.\n\nI deliberately tried to avoid Karen the best I could. I ate lunch in the sleep room, I let Dr. Singh exchange surgeries with me and I even accepted the clinic duty that the stupid Dr. Kiddy gave me cause I know Karen would be the same floor as the operation theater. \n\nI drove home, super tired, wishing I could have some peace of mind. The traffic was only driving me more crazy and the missed call from Karen didn't help.\n\nAs I stumbled into my apartment building I saw a familiar car parked outside. Dismissing it, I climbed the stairs to my third floor apartment as some stupid physicists on floor 5 at destroyed the elevator with rocket fuel. Who the hell has rocked fuel in their houses?\n\nTrying my hardest to locate the right key, I noticed the door was open. Alarmed, I slowly opened the door, careful not to make it creak and saw a blonde haired woman in the kitchen. How could this day get any worse I asked myself.\n\n\"You gave a key to me in case I needed it in emergencies. This was an emergency.\"\nI made a self note to slap myself 10 times as soon as I am alone.\nShe turned around and her beauty captivated me. Her pink lips, perfect cheek bones, lightly shadowed eyes and the yellow skirt she was wearing awed me. She did all this for me?\n\n\"You didn't need to cook for me Karen. I've lived by myself for over 3 years. You know as well as I do that I can cook just fine\" I exclaimed in the most tired tone ever\n\n\"I cleaned the apartment too. It wasn't that hard. You're pretty organized for a guy.\" She replied in a monotonous tone, turning back to focus on the chicken that was sizzling on the pan. \n\nI confirmed with my own eyes that the apartment was indeed cleaner than I left it this morning. She had moved my Halo Master chief figure and for that I will forever hate her.\n\nAs I was inspecting my 3 year old apartment trying to figure out the rights and the wrongs, Karen pulled me on to the sofa on my right and started laughing at my mildly shocked expressions.\n\nI was waiting for her laughter to die out to explain that it was all a mistake when she put a finger on top of my lips as soon as I opened them.\n\n\"I know how you are and how you keep your emotions under control. I know how you like your steak and how you like to keep to yourself. I know how you obsess over little things and how you care for nothing except your family and the thing riddling your patients. I know how much you've gone through and how much you've worked to get where you are today. I know of all the people that are close to you and all the people that have betrayed you. I've known you for the past two years and over the course of that time I've grown to love almost everything about you. What I don't love is your oven which burned the cookies I was trying to make. Just saying, get a new one. Getting to the point, I know how hard it must have been for you to admit your feelings to me and how hard it must have been after that. So I just want you to know that, I love you from the bottom of my liver and I will do whatever it takes for you to be a part of my life and whatever it takes to make you happy.\"\n\nI was dumbfounded. Her honesty hit me where it mattered and I thought to myself that it wasn't so bad to have Karen as my significant other.\n\n\"I'll take the 3%\" I said as I leaned in to kiss her smooth lips.\n\n\n\n*first post here, hope you like it*", "id": "d617yux"}, {"comment": "I don't get the part about 3%..\n\n", "id": "d623u6q"}, {"comment": "He had thought that there was a 97 percent chance of the relationship ending, so he has 3 percent chance :)", "id": "d626o81"}, {"comment": "Really enjoyed that.

The train slowly made its way up the first, biggest hill, and I felt my stomach being left further and further behind.  With each foot that we ratcheted along, I knew with more and more certainty that I'd made a massive mistake.  I could see the drop-off, the disaster, growing closer-\n\n-and I couldn't do a thing about it.\n\nNow, sitting in my bed and staring at my phone's glowing screen in the darkness, I felt that same pit opening up in my stomach, that same sense of disaster.\n\n\"Oh, shit,\" I murmured to myself.  Then again, louder: \"Shit!  Shit!\"\n\nQuick, is there any way to stop a message in the process of sending?  To Googl- no, too late.  It's sent.  \"Delivered\" popped up at the bottom of the screen.\n\nI stared at the word, praying that it wouldn't change.  Maybe she'd gone to bed, maybe she fell asleep with her phone pressed against her face, up too late talking to me, a little tipsy from the night's drinking-\n\nIt changed.\n\n\"Read 11:38 PM\"\n\nOh no.\n\nI leapt out of bed, cursing as my not-quite-awake feet tingled underneath me and wobbled, and sprinted down the hall.  As a senior, I'd earned my own single room in the old, creaky fraternity house, but Aaron still shared his room with Boomer.  I knew that Boomer was likely still out at the bars, but Aaron had wandered back a half hour earlier.\n\n\"Whazzup?\" he'd slurred, leaning into my room while holding onto the doorframe as if it was the only thing keeping him upright.\n\nI had sat up in bed, looked over at him.  \"Hey, you made it back from the bars!  Alive and alone, as usual!\"\n\n\"That's mean,\" he pouted, but he still came further into my room.  We'd traded insults back and forth for years; we both knew the flow of things.  \"How's your night been?  Stuck here, probably jerking it a bit to some nasty porn?\"\n\n\"If that's how you describe studying, then yes,\" I said, gesturing at the open textbooks spread out on my bed.  \"Texting Alice a bit.\"\n\nHe frowned.  \"Alice - she's that girl in your anatomy class, right?  The one that had all the guys hooting and hollering when she came over and put her anatomy on display?\"\n\nI grimaced, remembering that.  \"We're just friends.\"\n\n\"But you'd like to be more,\" Aaron guessed, keen despite the alcohol dulling his senses.  He grinned at the look of discomfort on my face.  \"Oh come on, dude, she's perfect for you.  Smart, knows all that same science stuff that you love, and goddamn, have you seen that chest?  I couldn't stop staring- ow!\"\n\nHe yelped because I threw my pencil at him.  \"Out!\" I commanded, pointing to the door.\n\n\"I'm just saying, dude,\" he insisted as he retreated.  \"You need to just go for it.  Make that move.  Sweep her off her feet, into your bed.  With your nerdiness, she's the best you'll ever land.\"\n\nI closed the door firmly behind him - and then sank back down in my bed.  Back to studying, I told myself.  My fingers, however, quickly strayed back to my phone.  Back to texting Alice.\n\nI didn't want to think about what Aaron had said, not the least because it was all true.  Alice really would be perfect with me, but she'd never see it, never go for me.  She was that cute, smart little blonde girl who seemed to attract success like an aura, wore it around her shoulders like a cloak.  She'd end up with some six-foot CEO who could buy her a yacht and a mansion, clinging to his chiseled arm and making the rest of us envious as we stared up the mountain of success at them, the figures on the peak.\n\nSure, I made her laugh - and I remembered that one night when, both of us yawning after a late-night study session that devolved into binge watching Happy Endings on Hulu, we snuggled together.  I could still smell the faint scent of cherries in her shampoo, remembered her warmth against me.\n\nI wanted that, and because I ached so strongly for her, I knew that I could never have her.  It wasn't meant to be.\n\nI heard my phone buzz.  \"Good night, hope the test doesn't murder you,\" she had sent me.\n\nI quickly keyed out a reply.  \"I'll live thru,\" I typed in, my finger already flying towards the send key.\n\nIt was then that it happened.\n\nEven as I pushed send, unable to stop that impulse traveling through my hand and down to my fingertip, I saw autocorrect jump in.  \"I'll live thru\" shifted, became \"I love you\".  \n\nAnd then the message was away, too late for me to respond.\n\nNow, bursting into Aaron's room without knocking, I gasped for breath.  \"Aaron, help!  I accidentally told her that I-\"\n\nI paused, averting my eyes as Aaron scrambled to haul his pants up, his screen still displaying a buxom lady moaning as she touched herself.  \"Dude, knock!\" he groaned.\n\nI laughed, but even this sight wasn't enough to distract me from my woes.  \"Aaron, I texted her that I love her!\"\n\n\"What?\"  Half-done-up belt forgotten, he turned and stared at me.  \"That isn't what I meant when I said you should go for it!  Start with coffee!\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to!\" I wailed.  \"It was autocorrect!  But she's read it!  What do I do?  What do I say?  Should I go over to her house and apologize?  She's only a block up the street-\"\n\nAaron stepped forward and slapped me, which I needed.  \"Thanks,\" I said, rubbing at my cheek and trying not to think about what that hand had touched before it hit my face.\n\n\"No problem.\"  He sighed.  \"What did she say?\"\n\nI checked the phone.  \"Nothing.  She read it, and then nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, damn.\"  He sank back down in his chair, noticed that his porn video was still playing, paused it.  I tried not to look at the face of the woman - or any other part of her - on display on the screen.  \"I think you have to go over there.\"\n\n\"Right, and apologize-\"\n\n\"No!\"  He stood up again, his eyes shining.  \"You need to own it!  This wasn't on purpose, but this could be your chance!  Wouldn't you rather know if the two of you have a shot, instead of wondering forever?\"\n\n\"Well, I-\"\n\n\"No, you would.  Now, go!  Get downstairs!\"  And even as I protested, he pushed me out of his room, down the stairs, down to the main room of our fraternity house!\n\nEven at this hour, a couple guys lounged about on the couch, watching late night television.  They turned and looked at the two of us, but Aaron didn't even pause.  He kept pushing me towards the front door.\n\n\"But I don't know what to say to her!\" I wailed, as he shoved me forward.\n\n\"Say the truth!  Tell her that you're sorry you came on a bit strong, it was autocorrect, but you really do like her and want to take her out for a drink!  Tell her the truth!\"  He gave me one last shove, and my hand landed on the doorknob.\n\nI pulled the door open.\n\nAnd Alice stood there on the other side, her hand still raised to knock.\n\nThe air drained from my lungs, that sinking feeling in my stomach once again.  \"Alice,\" I breathed out, and then ran out of oxygen.\n\n\"Hi,\" she said back, her voice barely audible.  \"I just- I wanted to- I mean, I didn't know that you-\"\n\nWe both stared at each other.  The guys on the couch stared at us.  Everyone was frozen - except for Aaron.\n\n\"Dude,\" he hissed at me in a whisper that everyone could hear within a mile.  \"Kiss her!\"\n\nI couldn't respond, but I felt heat creeping up into my cheeks.  And, amazingly, I saw a blush spread across Alice's beautiful, smart face as well!  Her eyes kept looking back into mine, bright, almost imploring me.  \n\nSlowly, clumsy as a newborn colt, I stepped forward.  I slid my arms around her, and she pressed forward against me.  \"Alice,\" I murmured, still not quite able to bring myself to do it, to commit.  \"That text, it was-\"\n\nShe kissed me before I could finish the sentence.\n\nFlashbulbs burst around me, inside my eyelids, as fireworks exploded in my brain.  I heard a clink next to me as Aaron's pants, barely held up after I burst in on him in his room, gave up the ghost and dropped to the floor.  The guys on the couch behind us all hooted and hollered, making monkey noises at us.\n\nI didn't care about any of it.  I kissed Alice back, loving the feel of her in my arms.  \n\nAnd that's the funny thing about rollercoasters, isn't it?

They had very specific \"positive\" reasons for doing what they did. Its again the dangers of dehumanizing people and extremely strong nationalism. \n\nHitler was very nationalist with a strong sense of patriotism and identified strongly with his cultural heritage. The plans for Lebensraum in Germany were to us evil. To them they seemed like good. They were securing German survival and helping the human race by removing the undesirables and settling in superior Germans. That is what they thought. That is still good intentions regardless of how evil that is seen today.

I grew up in the information era after all. Ever since I was young I've been surrounded by a seemingly infinite amount of information, but what I never realized until we became aware of whats now known as the mortality timer, is that all the information we have is about the past. Of course you could use that information to make predictions about the future, but you could never actually have concrete information on it. Until the mortality timer that is. \n\nNobody really understands how it works, it's ambiguous in that sense. Our basic understanding of it is that it has something to do with genetics. Honestly, I don't actually know how it works, or why it works, I'm not sure anyone does. The only thing we know is it has something to do with your family, whether it boils down to emotional connection, or if its on some molecular level based on genetic make up. Either way, you can only see the timer of your blood relatives. \n\nSo me and my wife can't see each other's timers, but our parents for example could see ours and vice versa. The mortality timer changed a lot of dynamics after its inception. It had become tradition for people getting married to try and seek out others with similar mortality meters. My wife and I were no exception. I was timed to die at the age of 82 while she sat at 86. We were both in our 30's, and she was pregnant, due to give birth any day now.  \n\nThe days leading up to our child's birth were nerve racking. Now a days when a child is born, the parents must report the mortality timer of the baby for the birth certificate. Some politician somewhere had decided that it was more cost effective and productive for society if only children who were going to live over the age of 40 were accepted into society. So now, to add to the already stressful event of having a child, parents had to worry about their babies timer. My wife being the worrier, was convinced our baby was going to come out with a sub 40 timer and be taken away. I loved her, but once she got ruminating on something, there was no stopping her. She was an emotional wreck those last couple days, crying in bed at all hours of the day, not talking for hours at a time. I would have done anything for her during those days, anything to take away the pain and stress. \n\nFinally the day came. I had convinced her to go to the hospital a day early as I was worried about possible damage the stress she had been experiencing may had been causing to the baby. When her water broke, they wheeled her, screaming, into the delivery room. I followed, trying to discern if what I felt was relief that the tumultuous period was over, or excitement for the birth of my child. Either way, I was ready for it. \n\nThe birth took 6 hours and fortunately had no complications. I was leaned over, hand locked in hand with my wife as we waited for the doctor to bring over the wailing baby that was to be my child. I broke my eyes from my wife and brought them to the baby. My wife said something then, but I didn't hear it. I was too focused on what I was seeing. Or rather, what I wasn't seeing. The baby had no timer.

I cleared my throat and spoke  \"What will get me the drunkest in the least amount of time?\"  He stopped for a moment, holding his stare. Suddenly his face lit up as he began his story.  \"I've been waiting for my time to shine, I've been working with alcohol for almost 30 years and to answer firstly you need to understand how alcohol works and how its broken down by your liver...\"  \"Shit, I've started him on a ELI5 rant.\"  I waited till he finished or at least got to his TL;DR, the answer eventually came and I ordered three shots of Tequila.

The doors swung open as a man wearing a large brown overcoat and hat walked through like a scene from a western. He made his way to the bartender and throws a single gold coin. The bartender catches it as the number 3 floating above his head suddenly morphs into the number 4. \"Thank you kind stranger\" the bartender squeals.  \n\n\"Oh, so that's what that is, seems pretty pointless.\" I thought to myself and laughed off the situation.  \"Why go to all the effort for an imaginary piece of gold that will never actually help you achieve anything in the real world.\"  That's what I thought... until I noticed my reflection in the golden tap just beside me. A zero floated above my head. \"A zero!

I cleared my throat and spoke  \"What will get me the drunkest in the least amount of time?\"  He stopped for a moment, holding his stare. Suddenly his face lit up as he began his story.  \"I've been waiting for my time to shine, I've been working with alcohol for almost 30 years and to answer firstly you need to understand how alcohol works and how its broken down by your liver...\"  \"Shit, I've started him on a ELI5 rant.\"  I waited till he finished or at least got to his TL;DR, the answer eventually came and I ordered three shots of Tequila. I threw them back without a moments thought.  He was right.

The doors swung open as a man wearing a large brown overcoat and hat walked through like a scene from a western. He made his way to the bartender and throws a single gold coin. The bartender catches it as the number 3 floating above his head suddenly morphs into the number 4. \"Thank you kind stranger\" the bartender squeals.  \n\n\"Oh, so that's what that is, seems pretty pointless.\" I thought to myself and laughed off the situation.  \"Why go to all the effort for an imaginary piece of gold that will never actually help you achieve anything in the real world.\"  That's what I thought... until I noticed my reflection in the golden tap just beside me.

I am nearly seven feet tall and am as lean and lanky as anyone you'll ever meet. Because my school requires that I play a sport, I am constant the target of ridicule.\n\nAnd unfortunately, track is the only sport I can play. It's the only sport with such low competition that I can keep myself calm. I cannot do that with basketball or lacrosse or baseball.\n\nI suppose I could do it on the swim team, but when you're as tall as I am, swimming of the pool is nearly impossible.\n\nSo I run. I don't race. My stamina is such that I can last a long time and out pace most anyone.\n\nWe are running a mile today. Teams from every corner of our state are here.

We can win!*\n\nWhat part of no, do you not understand?\n\n*But they're laughing at us! We're a mockery.*\n\nOther begins to whine about not being out to feed and tarts to ramble on. Damn him.

Not an ordinary firearm. No...\n\nI turn around so rapidly, my ears pop.

A small globe erupted from the barrel. Hellfire.\n\n*****\n\nI deflected the ball of fire and sent it hurling back into the sky. The gleam of my blade shimmered from the sun. Ah, Mordechai let me out.\n\n\"Haman! You have no place here. The Creator sent me to defend this world. And I will.\"\n\n\"Protect this tiny planet?\" Haman gave a rich laugh, and it did not sound humorous at all.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I will.\" Mordechai and I shared a body...or to be more precise, a vessel. The Creator, Adonai, had sent me to protect the Earth from all otherworldly threats. I had done so for many centuries.\n\nMordechai was lazy in his Hebrew lessons and called me Other. I knew myself by the name of one of the Creator's most righteous warriors, one who had died in service to the Creator three millenia ago. \n\n\"Uriah! Face me!\" Haman lunged forward, his evil metallic suit clicking and clanking. A long, lethal blade forced itself out of his shoulder. Haman grabbed the hilt and yanked it out. The sword was long and thin, a rapier. It was an odd contrast with the firearm that appeared to be styled off the human Saiga shotgun.\n\n*Don't just stand there! Fight him! Kill him! He is wicked and must be destroyed!*\n\nMordechai. Ours is a strange union. We share a body and can communicate by telepathy. Oddly enough, our telepathy is structured around whomever is in control of the body. I do not particularly enjoy having to converse in human slang. And he is spends far too much time eying that maiden Maya. Elizabeth is a far more desirable choice, kind-hearted and fair-haired and and a pleasant laugh.\n\n*We can aruge about my choice in a maiden with whom I will spend my life with after you destroy the murderer!*\n\nOh yes. My Creator instructed me to strike down Haman. \n\nI swung my sword and Haman tried to block it with his blaster. My sword slid downward and Haman took aim at a handful of fleeing civilians. The ball of flame hit the man in a black-and-white shirt in the leg. Immediately, it was seared off. The man dropped and began to scream.\n\n\"Haman, stand down or I will destroy you!

You were very nearly a challenge.\"\n\nHe stabs his rapier down onto my shoulder and raises his blaster. It begins to hum, which means he's putting more of his own power into it. He's aiming for a lethal shot.\n\nNo. Dear God, not like this. Creator above, not like this.\n\n\"Good-bye, Uriah.\"\n\nA metal ball goes flying and smashes against Haman's chest.\n\n\"Hey, Tin Man! You want him, you go through me!\"\n\nA short teenager, broad shouldered and thick in the chest, has a sack full of metal balls. In one hand, he holds a javelin. \n\n\"What? Who challenges me?!\"\n\n\"Simon Peterson. This is my track field! My team! I'm a Crusader!\"\n\n\"A Crusader?! Under which King do you serve?\"\n\n\"King? What century are you living in Grandpa Ugly? This is America. We don't have kings.\"\n\n\"Silence! You will pay for your tongue, insolent child! I am Haman! I will--\"\n\nThe boy called Simon threw three shotput balls in rapid succession, and they bounced off Haman's chest. \n\nEnraged, the Headhunter began to charge. My blade flew back into my hand, and I raced after him. Simon screamed in a manner not unlike a small girl and held his javelin outward. Haman broke it in half but before he could get a shot in, I slammed my fist into his shoulder.\n\nIn one hand I had my sword. At my belt was a warhammer. I pulled it out. My hammer proved far more effective against the evil being's armor. He tried to parry it with his blaster. I couldn't see Simon anywhere.\n\nFor a long minute, Haman and I traded blows, neither one of us yielding. His armor chipped away, but he pulled out more and more swords from his bones.\n\n\"Give up, Uriah! I will not surrender! This world is mine!\"\n\nWe were twenty feet apart from each other, moving in a circle, looking for an opening. Haman took his blaster and then added his word to it. And then a smaller hand cannon at his belt. He was combining his weapons...but why?\n\nThe answer was a fireball twenty feet in diameter, encased in spirals of ice and then lightning. I deflected it with my sword, but it tore a hole in the field, shredding all that remained of the bleachers.\n\n\"Give up, you cannot stand against this weapon!\"\n\nWhether I would have or not, I never found out, because as Haman began to gloat, a small blue tank made by a warrior family called Subaru blazed onto the field and ran Haman over. He dropped his mega-blaster and then Simon got out of the tank. I closed the distance in three strides and stabbed my sword through his chest.\n\n*You did it! You did it!*\n\nMordechai.\n\nSimon was holding the broken pieces of his javelin in the shape of a cross. \"Begone! Begone! Begone! In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost!\"\n\nHaman began to shriek and burn white. His armor began to crack into pieces. \n\n\"We will meet again Uriah!\"\n\n\"Here Mister! Put your big sword on his blaster and we'll see what happens!\"\n\n\"You will all burn!\"\n\nWhat happened was my new sword-blaster set out six blades of elemental energy in the shape of swords. Haman was incinerated and then disintegrated. \n\nI collapsed onto all fours.

Some people would die, that was unfortunate collateral.  It was nothing compared to what would happen if the dark lord got his hand on that award.

The look he received back settled him down.  Matt Damon was walking now to the stage, with no idea of what he had prevented.  He had to walk past DiCaprio but the order knew that he wouldn't stop him like this, it's too public.

All that hard work making a film on the red planet had seemingly seeped into the blood of the dead actor, nobody deserved the fate that had begot him.  As Kane rapidly followed the path, he surveyed the damage.  Seats flung across the hall, Gregory suffering a similar fate to Damon, panic.  This would only serve the darkness, he thought to himself.\n\nTurning the corner, his greatest worry was apparent.  The discarded golden head of Emilio Fernandez, the famous Oscar statuette, was strewn on the ground.  Then the left arm, the leg combination, and finally the top plate to the base.  The security system on the statue hadn't worked.  The gemstone was gone.  Now it was only a matter of time until Leonardo extracted the mineral.  The race was on, but Kane was already behind, knowing that as soon as he reach the red carpet the already thinly-laid path he'd been following would end.\n\n\"DAMNIT ABEL!\", he screamed.

Though he has changed his appearance, we\u2019re positive he\u2019s the same warlock we\u2019ve been fighting for as long as I\u2019ve lived, and longer than that. We are an ancient sect, part of an order that has sworn to deny that atrocious warlock of ever obtaining an Academy Award trophy, at any cost, even our own lives. While some may have concluded that the trophy is made up of 24-karat gold plating on their surface, it\u2019s their inner metal alloy mix that is his concern. The main metal mixture is called Britannium, an alloy of mostly tin, antimony, and copper. Unbeknown to most humans, there is another trace element called *malinium* that can **only** be found in these trophies. Why is that? Simple. The Paladins removed all traces of malinium centuries ago from the earth\u2019s core. That is why most humans do not know of its existence. It hasn\u2019t become detected yet, and hopefully it never will. If it does, fear not, for the only way that swine can harness its powers is for him to have it given to him willingly. That is why he is so hell-bent on winning the award; the spell cast upon the trophy seals the malinium safely away from his treacherous claws, which is unless he wins it. He thought he destroyed us all, but we remain. We are healers. Mostly we work in healthcare, healing the sick. There aren\u2019t many of us left. Those of us that survived have scattered ourselves around the world. We will not make the same mistake again. We cannot let our identities be known, nor can we have our traditional meetings for fear of all being in the same place, being discovered and destroyed for good. The warlock has become complacent. He believes that it is only a matter of time before he wins. He does not know that I will be there\u2026 It is my turn this year to prevent that evil spawn from gaining what he treasures above all else. I am a part of the Academy voters. If the Academy does not vote for another actor, it is my sole duty to expunge the true results and fabricate my own.

However, if you just take a look at the bests the Hollywood has to offer today and in the future, it becomes clears that devils goals are as close to succeeding as somethings that have a very very large distance between them.\n\nWhat I find more funny than Leonardo still trying to win Oscars is that he knows the people who own them.

I am still holding a scotch and soda, and the tux I had just purchased for my first Oscars did little to keep out the salty cold. Julius\u2019 wings were showing now.

Another decade writing steady, if uninspired, scripts that were hacked to pieces and resurrected as soulless movies that looked nothing like your originals. And now, now you get an invitation to decide the fate of the Oscars, and the world. Do you want to know why? Because I lifted you up. I know you will make the right decision.

We must deny him, at all costs, any portion of a statue that issues forth from that doomed, earthy gullet. \n\nThe solution, it turned out, was simple. Several tons of radioactive waste were subtly permeated throughout the region of the cave, along with finely minced holy texts suspended in a solution of All-Faith-Holy-Liquids. Last, copious amounts of cement layered with silver bars. It's been about 10 hours since the statues should have spewed out, glistening with that smoky slime that burns the eyes.

I thought I could prevent this from happening, but those damned Hollywood bastards had to go and make The Revenant! Fools! They have no idea what they\u2019ve brought upon us! I know people have been preaching the end is nigh since there was humans to understand the concept, but for once the end is truly nigh. \n\nMany, many years ago my father called me to the backyard. He sat on the swing set, silent, scared. I had never seen him like this before. He cleared his throat and began: \u201cMy son, there are people in this world who wish to see dark, and disgusting things come back.

I could feel the crosshairs on me for a few seconds, but then they were gone. Little did I know I would meet my dad\u2019s assassin in the not too distant future. \n\nI was confused, and lost. And one day my answers came. Several armed men took me and my mother far away, where they explained it all. They told me how an ancient evil order devoted to a sea demon planned to release his holy restraints. The only issue being the most important part of this spell was nearly unobtainable. However, the place they could obtain it from was a statue, a very special one. An Oscar statue. Evidently the trophy develops the mineral through intense concentration of a million minds. It\u2019s no bigger than an atom, but integral to this formula to summon a dark lord from the deepest part of the sea. They trained me and taught me, and helped me secure a position as a judge for this special trophy. And one day\u2026I would meet the immortal man who wished to have it\u2026Leonardo DiCaprio\n\nI remember it well. I saw Titanic with my then girlfriend, now wife, and we both loved it. We went to a special screening as I\u2019d just obtained a job as one of the judges. I met Leo there, a charming man indeed. I was in the stall as I heard him and another man talking, they were speaking in hushed whispers as if they were in some sort of spy movie. \u2018Finally, the circle is coming to a full close. We only need this one piece, and we shall bring our lord back from the depths.\u2019 It took me a moment to realize it was Leonardo speaking! The other man I still don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t leave until they were both gone. But I had overheard enough to know who it was that couldn\u2019t have this award. I met him after and did my best to pretend I knew nothing, politely shaking his hand with a chuckle, and wishing him good evening. He pulled me close, and with a bit of a growl in my ear, \u201cThe Serpent Lord will return\u2026\u201d He patted my back as if nothing had been said, and was on his way.\n\n\nFrom that day forward, I\u2019ve done everything in my power to block him from getting this trophy, sometimes it meant doing despicable things, but it was to save the world. I see memes every day; I\u2019ve seen every single movie. The Departed, What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape, Wolf of Wall Street, all of his amazing performances. I was so close to caving when I saw Django Unchained! The tiniest part of me ached to give in but I couldn\u2019t let him have the trophy, the consequences were not nearly worth such a thing! \n\nHowever, I know tonight is it. I sit drinking a bottle of scotch, and I know what I\u2019ll do at the awards ceremony. I will make sure I\u2019m seated right beside him in the audience. I\u2019ll bribe anyone and everyone I must to do so. I\u2019ll look him those beautiful eyes, with that perfect smile, and before he can even stand, I\u2019ll finish it before it starts.

Though some of the victims seemed random, there was a pattern. A rhyme to the reason.  I couldn't put my finger on it. Not until I saw the nominations on TV one night. Then it clicked. \nSo here I am, outside a modest Bel Air estate (less modest and more estate) waiting for someone or something that may or may not come. But the pattern is there--the patterns don't lie. \nThe outliers are coincidence, or an effort to mask the truth. Police don't like to look any deeper than they have to. But only flotsam and jetsam float to the surface. \nThe rustle in the bushes is the first thing to catch my eye. I watched as it moves slowly up the face of the wall and over.  I hop out of the car and over the wall behind it. Whatever scaled the wall is fast, gone by the time I reach the ground. The weight of the silver dagger on my belt is a comfort. Not a lot of puresilver in circulation anymore, and every ounce of it is precious. I unsnap it's sheath as I reach out to the half-open door to the kitchen...\n\nThe door swings open quietly--empty house.  Empty except for the sound of footsteps above. I creep past the marble countertops and up the sweeping stairway.  The drapery is dancing on invisible currents of air. But the windows are closed. Bad sign. \nI reach the top at the same time I hear the chanting coming from down the hall.  A dark figure inside the doorway. I pull the dagger from its sheath without breaking stride. The closer I got to the doorway, to the Dark One, the further away I felt, like it was moving inexorably away from me. I reach the end. My body jumps to the side  instinctively as the floor creaks beneath my weight. The chanting stops and I hear a rustle as the creature turns.  Seconds seem like hours as the beast listens and waits--I am still, hoping my own heartbeat doesn't give me away. The chanting resumes. I peek in and see it facing a large circle drawn in chaulk. At each of the eight Cardinal Directions an small gold statue, each also facing inward to the center. The chanting swells and the wind begins to pick up. I close on my target, his blonde hair blowing in the otherworldly gale. I can almost reach out and touch it and for a moment I feel a twinge of pity for the creature. I bring down the knife, jamming it into his shoulder at the neck. \n\nFor a split second everything stops. The chanting, the wind, everything.  Time stands still. Then it shifts it's weight and slams into me with its left arm. My lungs collapse as I hit the far wall and take a knee.  Gasping for air I look up to see the monsters dull grey eyes staring at me with malice. Though he looked like he weighed a buck forty, he hit like a truck. I stagger to my feet as it stares at his hand, at the blood wiped from the gash in his neck. The monster makes it three steps toward me before it collapses to the floor.  It  stares at me as I cautiously walk toward it, dagger in hand.  I kneel next to it and hear him gasping for breath. Blood escaping through gritted teeth. \n\n\"You fool,\" he rasps, \"this world is nothing but a dream within a dream.\"  \n\nI lift the dagger overhead. To offer a mercy, put the creature out of its misery.  \n\n\"I'm the King of the World\" he wheezes. \n\nHe turns and whips his hand toward the circle, the gathered blood splattering into place. With a roar the circle is engulfed with ghostly flames. I raise my other arm to shield my eyes and fall backward from the force of the circle. Too little too late.  The roar of the ghost flame  and the laughter of the foul creature drown the room in cacophony. Inside the circle a form begins to appear, shadow against the ghostly light. The sounds I hear are enough to cut to the bone. \n\n\"Woooo!  HaHaaaaa!\" came the voice from the flame. \n\nI scramble to my feet and out the door. I had no chance now. Down the stairs and out the kitchen door my head swimming in the realization of the consequences that tonight would bring. I reach the car as the window of the second floor room blows out sending glass clear across the street. The Horror was staring as I looked back. \n\nI jump in and gun it. \n\n\"Aww, Hell No! Ain't nobody comin' into my neighborhood and killing my minions and getting away with it\" the Beast Roared. \"That's right, run. Look at you all banged up!  Who's the man?!\"\n\nI rocket around the corner and into the darkness.

Inside the golden man is a single gram of *gravitanium*, element 141, which forms only at the center of black holes.  The sample is exactly the same size and shape of a grain of sand. \n\nGravitanium, known for centuries among spellcasters as *stardust*, is widely sought-after for its use in love spells (owing to its ability to draw the desired one closer and closer to the spellcaster.)  The origin of its use in magic can be traced to a single man, the nefarious *Leonardo di Caprio,* an skilled spellcaster wanted for several serious crimes against magic.  The story of how di Caprio came to gravitanium is thus:\n\nIn the 11th century, in Florence, di Caprio was an arrogant young spellcaster who fell in love with the daughter of a lord.  She would not have him because of his low station, so Leonardo traveled the world in search of a magical substance the would draw her in helplessly.  In Siberia, he discovered gravitanium by watching the native *esquimos* use it at night to draw heat into their beds.  He quickly realized that gravitanium was exactly what he needed, and brought it back with haste to Florence.  \n\nUnfortunately, the lady had already married someone else by then.  \n\nIn his petulant anger, Di Caprio flung the gravitanium into the sea.  Incredibly heavy, it sank to the bottom in just a few seconds and was lost forever.  Said Leonardo: \"no problem; there's plenty more where that came from.\"\n\nBut there wasn't.  As word of its power spread among magic folk, gravitanium began to disappear from the face of the Earth.  In Siberia, handfuls of it were raked off the snow and pushed into shimmering, black piles.  They were gone before Leonardo arrived, paid for in gold by an undisclosed party.\n\nYear after year, century after century, Leonardo sought the substance, but it eluded him.  Things got even worse for Leonardo during the renaissance, when it was discovered that, held in the hands of an artist's model, gravitanium allowed painters to \"fall into their subjects\" while painting them - a  kind of deep pinpoint focus that allowed artists to reach new heights.  And all the while, Leonardo's answer grew.   \n\n  \n\n "], [2, "Through my mirrored shutter shades I can see him behind me, sitting smugly. So damn assured of himself.

We spent days arguing in the council chamber beneath the Vietnamese massage parlour, and the conclusion was drawn.\n\nThe nuclear option. For the sake of western civilization I had to once more do the unthinkable.

One of the best films of all time!\u201d\nWith that I turn and sprint, I can hear his footsteps pounding after me, I burst into the lobby. A lightning storm of camera flashes, the sweet siren's call of fans wanting to tell me I\u2019m great but I block it out.

Halfway into his transformation, his body swollen to the point his tux lay in tattered rags behind him, thick claws from his hand fingernails and sprouting from his feet, his maw extending and hair over inch of his body. \n\nI keep sprinting.

Once he\u2019s all bear there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to keep ahead of him, but I see it before me.

I hear one brakes scream and then slam, but without the harsh metallic crunch of engines against bumpers. I turn already knowing what I\u2019ll see and there he is, his final form. Leonardo Dicaprio having so convincingly acted a bear, he is one. He screams in pain at me. Not at the thousand pounds of twisted steel wrapped round his body he shrugs off like a sweater, but at being denied the touch of his precious. He stands of his hind legs and bellows. I step up onto the edge of the freeway lip. 60 mile an hour traffic whizzing belong, he reaches a paw and moans. But I have to.

He has been playing a long game.. Taking the form of a young boy, he had entered the industry, trying to get ahead, trying to get noticed.

But we, the Order, must do everything in our power to stop that from happening, because the alternative is too terrifying to think about.\n\nI straightened my bowtie. I was getting nervous, we had never attempted anything this risky in the past.\n\nThe Order had always managed to swing the academy vote and deny the Warlock, Leo, from winning the award. In the past there had always been a good alternative, so that people never felt suspicious.. But over time, his dark magic had started it's work on the public.

All those things had made the Order nervous, very nervous indeed.\n\nThis year, the internal vote had failed.. The academy had decided to award Leo the honour. The Order has been in a tizzy.

He shuffled in his chair, somewhat nervously, with the years beginning to take their toll, and he knew that they'd taken a risk.  The Danish girl?  10 years ago he would have never thought of it, but he knew the longer it went on the harder it would be to deny Leo.  He was constantly evolving, the order had to as well.\n\nThe hostess had already reached the second nomination.  He could feel the sweat dripping down now.  From the corner of his eye, it was clear that Gregory was shifting his weight.  The men were all in position, so if the normal method didn't work the fall-back was in place.  Some people would die, that was unfortunate collateral.  It was nothing compared to what would happen if the dark lord got his hand on that award.  For any lesser man, the order never had to worry about the gemstone falling out, it was an intricate mechanism keeping it contained, one could not simply stumble upon it.  The recent advances in fingerprint recognition only helped the situation.  If only we'd had that in Hiroshima he thought to himself.  So many lives wasted\u2026still, since then when they stumbled upon this method, they had stopped it when it was in the form of the man the humans called Richard Burton, and so far they'd stopped the darkness in it's new form.\n\nAwoken from his thoughts by the thundering applause, he looked quickly at Gregory, with no idea of who had won.  The look he received back settled him down.  Matt Damon was walking now to the stage, with no idea of what he had prevented.  He had to walk past DiCaprio but the order knew that he wouldn't stop him like this, it's too public.  That was the beauty of the plan, no security was needed, each year a new celebrity took it to a new place, with a new system, and new attention.  Leonardo could never get what he so desperately wanted.\n\nThe lights flickered briefly, before staying off and plunging the theatre into darkness.  Ladies screams pierced the air, with a few jovial laughs.  Such was the atmosphere at events like this, everyone is on edge, though an awkward mishap during the biggest presentation of the evening didn't look good.  Suddenly, a roar bellowed out so loud it was impossible to pinpoint where it came from.\n\nKane sprung into action.  He knew *what* it was from, and had the emergency lighting to benefit his sight now.  Damon was a lost cause, his bloodied hand was still twitching but it wasn't worth prolonging his pain much longer.  He had served his job, albeit unknowingly and unexpectedly; red footsteps from DiCaprio were clear on the glossy stage.  All that hard work making a film on the red planet had seemingly seeped into the blood of the dead actor, nobody deserved the fate that had begot him.  As Kane rapidly followed the path, he surveyed the damage.  Seats flung across the hall, Gregory suffering a similar fate to Damon, panic.  This would only serve the darkness, he thought to himself.\n\nTurning the corner, his greatest worry was apparent.  The discarded golden head of Emilio Fernandez, the famous Oscar statuette, was strewn on the ground.  Then the left arm, the leg combination, and finally the top plate to the base.  The security system on the statue hadn't worked.  The gemstone was gone.  Now it was only a matter of time until Leonardo extracted the mineral.  The race was on, but Kane was already behind, knowing that as soon as he reach the red carpet the already thinly-laid path he'd been following would end.\n\n\"DAMNIT ABEL!\", he screamed.

Though he has changed his appearance, we\u2019re positive he\u2019s the same warlock we\u2019ve been fighting for as long as I\u2019ve lived, and longer than that. We are an ancient sect, part of an order that has sworn to deny that atrocious warlock of ever obtaining an Academy Award trophy, at any cost, even our own lives. While some may have concluded that the trophy is made up of 24-karat gold plating on their surface, it\u2019s their inner metal alloy mix that is his concern. The main metal mixture is called Britannium, an alloy of mostly tin, antimony, and copper. Unbeknown to most humans, there is another trace element called *malinium* that can **only** be found in these trophies. Why is that? Simple. The Paladins removed all traces of malinium centuries ago from the earth\u2019s core. That is why most humans do not know of its existence. It hasn\u2019t become detected yet, and hopefully it never will. If it does, fear not, for the only way that swine can harness its powers is for him to have it given to him willingly. That is why he is so hell-bent on winning the award; the spell cast upon the trophy seals the malinium safely away from his treacherous claws, which is unless he wins it. He thought he destroyed us all, but we remain. We are healers. Mostly we work in healthcare, healing the sick. There aren\u2019t many of us left. Those of us that survived have scattered ourselves around the world. We will not make the same mistake again. We cannot let our identities be known, nor can we have our traditional meetings for fear of all being in the same place, being discovered and destroyed for good. The warlock has become complacent. He believes that it is only a matter of time before he wins. He does not know that I will be there\u2026 It is my turn this year to prevent that evil spawn from gaining what he treasures above all else. I am a part of the Academy voters.

However, the place they could obtain it from was a statue, a very special one. An Oscar statue. Evidently the trophy develops the mineral through intense concentration of a million minds. It\u2019s no bigger than an atom, but integral to this formula to summon a dark lord from the deepest part of the sea.

I met him after and did my best to pretend I knew nothing, politely shaking his hand with a chuckle, and wishing him good evening. He pulled me close, and with a bit of a growl in my ear, \u201cThe Serpent Lord will return\u2026\u201d He patted my back as if nothing had been said, and was on his way.\n\n\nFrom that day forward, I\u2019ve done everything in my power to block him from getting this trophy, sometimes it meant doing despicable things, but it was to save the world.

Though some of the victims seemed random, there was a pattern. A rhyme to the reason.  I couldn't put my finger on it. Not until I saw the nominations on TV one night. Then it clicked. \nSo here I am, outside a modest Bel Air estate (less modest and more estate) waiting for someone or something that may or may not come. But the pattern is there--the patterns don't lie. \nThe outliers are coincidence, or an effort to mask the truth. Police don't like to look any deeper than they have to. But only flotsam and jetsam float to the surface. \nThe rustle in the bushes is the first thing to catch my eye. I watched as it moves slowly up the face of the wall and over.  I hop out of the car and over the wall behind it. Whatever scaled the wall is fast, gone by the time I reach the ground. The weight of the silver dagger on my belt is a comfort. Not a lot of puresilver in circulation anymore, and every ounce of it is precious. I unsnap it's sheath as I reach out to the half-open door to the kitchen...\n\nThe door swings open quietly--empty house.  Empty except for the sound of footsteps above. I creep past the marble countertops and up the sweeping stairway.  The drapery is dancing on invisible currents of air. But the windows are closed. Bad sign. \nI reach the top at the same time I hear the chanting coming from down the hall.  A dark figure inside the doorway. I pull the dagger from its sheath without breaking stride. The closer I got to the doorway, to the Dark One, the further away I felt, like it was moving inexorably away from me. I reach the end. My body jumps to the side  instinctively as the floor creaks beneath my weight. The chanting stops and I hear a rustle as the creature turns.  Seconds seem like hours as the beast listens and waits--I am still, hoping my own heartbeat doesn't give me away. The chanting resumes. I peek in and see it facing a large circle drawn in chaulk. At each of the eight Cardinal Directions an small gold statue, each also facing inward to the center. The chanting swells and the wind begins to pick up. I close on my target, his blonde hair blowing in the otherworldly gale. I can almost reach out and touch it and for a moment I feel a twinge of pity for the creature. I bring down the knife, jamming it into his shoulder at the neck. \n\nFor a split second everything stops. The chanting, the wind, everything.  Time stands still. Then it shifts it's weight and slams into me with its left arm. My lungs collapse as I hit the far wall and take a knee.  Gasping for air I look up to see the monsters dull grey eyes staring at me with malice. Though he looked like he weighed a buck forty, he hit like a truck. I stagger to my feet as it stares at his hand, at the blood wiped from the gash in his neck. The monster makes it three steps toward me before it collapses to the floor.  It  stares at me as I cautiously walk toward it, dagger in hand.  I kneel next to it and hear him gasping for breath. Blood escaping through gritted teeth. \n\n\"You fool,\" he rasps, \"this world is nothing but a dream within a dream.\"  \n\nI lift the dagger overhead. To offer a mercy, put the creature out of its misery.  \n\n\"I'm the King of the World\" he wheezes. \n\nHe turns and whips his hand toward the circle, the gathered blood splattering into place. With a roar the circle is engulfed with ghostly flames. I raise my other arm to shield my eyes and fall backward from the force of the circle. Too little too late.  The roar of the ghost flame  and the laughter of the foul creature drown the room in cacophony. Inside the circle a form begins to appear, shadow against the ghostly light. The sounds I hear are enough to cut to the bone. \n\n\"Woooo!  HaHaaaaa!\" came the voice from the flame. \n\nI scramble to my feet and out the door. I had no chance now. Down the stairs and out the kitchen door my head swimming in the realization of the consequences that tonight would bring.

Ain't nobody comin' into my neighborhood and killing my minions and getting away with it\" the Beast Roared. \"That's right, run. Look at you all banged up!

Inside the golden man is a single gram of *gravitanium*, element 141, which forms only at the center of black holes.  The sample is exactly the same size and shape of a grain of sand. \n\nGravitanium, known for centuries among spellcasters as *stardust*, is widely sought-after for its use in love spells (owing to its ability to draw the desired one closer and closer to the spellcaster.)  The origin of its use in magic can be traced to a single man, the nefarious *Leonardo di Caprio,* an skilled spellcaster wanted for several serious crimes against magic.  The story of how di Caprio came to gravitanium is thus:\n\nIn the 11th century, in Florence, di Caprio was an arrogant young spellcaster who fell in love with the daughter of a lord.  She would not have him because of his low station, so Leonardo traveled the world in search of a magical substance the would draw her in helplessly.  In Siberia, he discovered gravitanium by watching the native *esquimos* use it at night to draw heat into their beds.  He quickly realized that gravitanium was exactly what he needed, and brought it back with haste to Florence.  \n\nUnfortunately, the lady had already married someone else by then.  \n\nIn his petulant anger, Di Caprio flung the gravitanium into the sea.  Incredibly heavy, it sank to the bottom in just a few seconds and was lost forever.  Said Leonardo: \"no problem; there's plenty more where that came from.\"\n\nBut there wasn't.  As word of its power spread among magic folk, gravitanium began to disappear from the face of the Earth.  In Siberia, handfuls of it were raked off the snow and pushed into shimmering, black piles.  They were gone before Leonardo arrived, paid for in gold by an undisclosed party.\n\nYear after year, century after century, Leonardo sought the substance, but it eluded him.  Things got even worse for Leonardo during the renaissance, when it was discovered that, held in the hands of an artist's model, gravitanium allowed painters to \"fall into their subjects\" while painting them - a  kind of deep pinpoint focus that allowed artists to reach new heights.  And all the while, Leonardo's answer grew.   \n\n  \n\n ", "id": "cz4vr2x"}], [{"comment": "Through my mirrored shutter shades I can see him behind me, sitting smugly. So damn assured of himself.

A schoolteacher called in the day before to have an officer to talk to, experiencing 3rd degree loneliness. Heaven, even one of Consular Gurhast's wives reported a rain cloud over her garden that required surveillance.   \nTheir department was swamped, but no case was too much for them.   \nSuch was their duty.  \nOfficer Haldur reminded himself of this as he took on another case. It was labeled as a one-officer assignment. So Haldur volunteered to pursue any leads on his own, taking on another solo case. Most rookies couldn't handle these with their other duties. Picking up this one gave his fellow officers time to solve other serious, recurring cases. Hopefully the schoolteacher's loneliness would be resolved without him for now (the poor man).   \nWhen the officer received the folder of details from Commissioner Stevan, he was told that this case was unlike any other.  \nHaldur assured the commissioner of his experience. He watered his fair share of flowers in his day. And did Officer Haldur not prevent the Great Cookie Shortage of '95? Those were two long hours toiling at the community kitchen, saving a whole classroom from disappointment.  \nHe was given a key to the city that day. It still hung on his living room wall.    \nThe commissioner nodded, aware of Haldur's long career with the Shine police department. So the portfolio was received with Stevan's blessing, and warning.  \nHaldur didn't notice the confidential tag on the folder until he sat at his desk.  \nGreat, another escort with the Mayor in her weekly stroll through the city yard. Not that he minded, but police officers were usually eager for these kinds of assignments. Confidential cases meant ensuring the general happiness of specific public figures.  \nIt surprised Haldur, because officers normally would find any excuse to avoid the stress of a routine community soup kitchen shift.  \nThere were never enough biscuits.  \nSo how was this escort case ignored?  \nWhat Haldur found instead flung his mind back to his last year working on his doctorate;  \n*\"Confidential once used to mean secretive. Yes, laugh, it sounds silly, but legends say it once labeled documents...\"*  \nThe portfolio dropped on his desk, spilling it's contents across the once immaculate surface.  \n*\"... not meant for anyone's eyes, but their own. Those were darker times.\"*  \nAn old word tore across the top document.  \n*Murder.*  \nIt was accompanied by an image. It looked like a body, but despite Officer Haldur's worst fears, he understood the photo represented more.    \nHe got his doctorate in the classics, and knew his myths.  \nNo, it wasn't just a body.  \nThis was a corpse.  \nThe veteran was assigned the first murder case of Island in 500 years. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nIt was a stabbing. Two puncture wounds from the back. Not from slipping on a kitchen floor. Haldur imagined any scenario where a young woman in her fifties might find herself dead on her floor with two lethal thrusts from a sharp object, that did not assume malicious intent.  \nThe forensic analysis of the scene confirmed it was intentional. An offender was seen leaving the premises by the neighbors.  \nHopefully this was the *old* confidential label. How many months of counseling would it take for the Thyrmun's to get over seeing a---  \nWhat an old, ugly word.  \nMurder.  \nIt sounded awkward and unpleasant, no, *evil* in his head. As though he were committing a crime just reading this document. As a veteran officer, his hardest cases should have bolstered his resolve to see joy and service spread through the capital community.  \nThis was what he signed on for. What he committed his life to.  \nBut this...  \nOfficer Haldur wasn't sure where to begin.  \nThey may need to bring a foreign officer to assist him.  \nA foreigner! Like the commissioner would allow it! Heaven, not even the Coast Guard in their most desperate times would entertain such a thought.  \nThe case was unprecedented. No logs existed of murder cases to fall back on and guide him. Myths weren't enough.  \nThere was no choice.  \nOfficer Haldur's first battle would be to convince the Board of Sanctity to allow a foreign police officer to join him on this case. The Lesser States were never their concern, not for as long as Shine City stood tall.  \nBut no officer in Island had any experience with a case like this. Not even Haldur himself. The young woman in the photo demanded retribution.  \nWhat a word.  \n*Retribution.* Haldur meant to say justice. Why then, did the photo make him feel so unpleasant? More than that, there was a state in the old books that went a stage lower.  \nThat was it.  \nAnger.  \nHeaven, she was in the prime of her life!  \nIt was decided. They needed outside help. Another first for Island. Officer Haldur hoped he was up for the task, but still wondered how the schoolteacher was holding up as he got up from his desk.  \nAny other day, and he would have been checking in on him.  \n3rd degree loneliness was pretty serious after all.

Heaven, even one of Consular Gurhast's wives reported a rain cloud over her garden that required surveillance.   \nTheir department was swamped, but no case was too much for them.   \nSuch was their duty.  \nOfficer Haldur reminded himself of this as he took on another case. It was labeled as a one-officer assignment. So Haldur volunteered to pursue any leads on his own, taking on another solo case. Most rookies couldn't handle these with their other duties. Picking up this one gave his fellow officers time to solve other serious, recurring cases. Hopefully the schoolteacher's loneliness would be resolved without him for now (the poor man).   \nWhen the officer received the folder of details from Commissioner Stevan, he was told that this case was unlike any other.  \nHaldur assured the commissioner of his experience. He watered his fair share of flowers in his day. And did Officer Haldur not prevent the Great Cookie Shortage of '95? Those were two long hours toiling at the community kitchen, saving a whole classroom from disappointment.  \nHe was given a key to the city that day. It still hung on his living room wall.    \nThe commissioner nodded, aware of Haldur's long career with the Shine police department. So the portfolio was received with Stevan's blessing, and warning.  \nHaldur didn't notice the confidential tag on the folder until he sat at his desk.  \nGreat, another escort with the Mayor in her weekly stroll through the city yard. Not that he minded, but police officers were usually eager for these kinds of assignments. Confidential cases meant ensuring the general happiness of specific public figures.  \nIt surprised Haldur, because officers normally would find any excuse to avoid the stress of a routine community soup kitchen shift.  \nThere were never enough biscuits.  \nSo how was this escort case ignored?  \nWhat Haldur found instead flung his mind back to his last year working on his doctorate;  \n*\"Confidential once used to mean secretive. Yes, laugh, it sounds silly, but legends say it once labeled documents...\"*  \nThe portfolio dropped on his desk, spilling it's contents across the once immaculate surface.  \n*\"... not meant for anyone's eyes, but their own. Those were darker times.\"*  \nAn old word tore across the top document.  \n*Murder.*  \nIt was accompanied by an image. It looked like a body, but despite Officer Haldur's worst fears, he understood the photo represented more.    \nHe got his doctorate in the classics, and knew his myths.  \nNo, it wasn't just a body.  \nThis was a corpse.  \nThe veteran was assigned the first murder case of Island in 500 years. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nIt was a stabbing. Two puncture wounds from the back. Not from slipping on a kitchen floor. Haldur imagined any scenario where a young woman in her fifties might find herself dead on her floor with two lethal thrusts from a sharp object, that did not assume malicious intent.  \nThe forensic analysis of the scene confirmed it was intentional. An offender was seen leaving the premises by the neighbors.  \nHopefully this was the *old* confidential label. How many months of counseling would it take for the Thyrmun's to get over seeing a---  \nWhat an old, ugly word.  \nMurder.  \nIt sounded awkward and unpleasant, no, *evil* in his head. As though he were committing a crime just reading this document. As a veteran officer, his hardest cases should have bolstered his resolve to see joy and service spread through the capital community.  \nThis was what he signed on for. What he committed his life to.  \nBut this...  \nOfficer Haldur wasn't sure where to begin.  \nThey may need to bring a foreign officer to assist him.  \nA foreigner! Like the commissioner would allow it! Heaven, not even the Coast Guard in their most desperate times would entertain such a thought.  \nThe case was unprecedented. No logs existed of murder cases to fall back on and guide him. Myths weren't enough.  \nThere was no choice.  \nOfficer Haldur's first battle would be to convince the Board of Sanctity to allow a foreign police officer to join him on this case. The Lesser States were never their concern, not for as long as Shine City stood tall.  \nBut no officer in Island had any experience with a case like this. Not even Haldur himself. The young woman in the photo demanded retribution.  \nWhat a word.  \n*Retribution.* Haldur meant to say justice. Why then, did the photo make him feel so unpleasant? More than that, there was a state in the old books that went a stage lower.  \nThat was it.  \nAnger.  \nHeaven, she was in the prime of her life!  \nIt was decided. They needed outside help. Another first for Island. Officer Haldur hoped he was up for the task, but still wondered how the schoolteacher was holding up as he got up from his desk.  \nAny other day, and he would have been checking in on him.  \n3rd degree loneliness was pretty serious after all.

But I always felt she was a step ahead of me.\n\nEven during sex we both had weapons hidden close by. The reward for murdering the enemy sketched on you was enlightenment.

FOX, CNN, NBC, TYT, the whole works. \n\nYeah, go on... do a quick google search on my name...No? Good.\n\nI see you don't give a flying fuck what mainstream media outlets and biased, tabloid internet news tells you.\n\nI...guess I could tell you my side of the story. That is if you are interested? Well then, You might want to order us some coffee.\n\nSo, here goes...The gist of what headlines will tell you is that my son was born 'special' - A euphemism for being born with my name on him. \n\nNow, as you know- to have a parents name on one's wrist is not altogether that uncommon. Sadly, it does happen in some rare cases. \n\nIf this happens you're screwed. It doesn't matter if you're going to be your child's worst enemy, or their soulmate - as a parent both connotations are terrible. If you're the child's enemy you are labelled a 'potential child killer', If you're the child's soul mate the label becomes - 'potential incestuous paedophile'. \n\nDon't know which one of those I prefer really...\n\nWe call children who bear their parents names on them the \"in immunditiis filiorum\" or IMFs for short - means \"dirty children\" in Latin. It's not a term without controversy, after all it's not the babe's fault that it is born with those names on it's wrist! \n\nNor is it necessarily the parents fault I'd argue. \n\nI concede that statistically speaking, there is an undeniable correlation between the names you have on your wrist and the relationships you form with the people to whom those names belong to. This has been considered fact as long as I can remember.\n\nThe thing is - there's no science behind that bullshit. It's all religious, spirituality nonsense. Until they can come up with a verifiable hypothesis as to why this phenomenon occurs I refuse to believe that \"fate\" is a thing. \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul\" - I love that quote.\n\nStereotypes towards the parents of IMFs are bullshit anyway. I believe the tattoos have much more subtle implications than \"killer\" and \"incestuous pig\". \n\nThe two simply imply the most positive and the most negative relationships you will have in your life. It isn't any more complicated than that! You can be a \"soulmate\" by platonically being someones best friend and you can be an \"enemy\" through the simple act of being a bad influence!  \n\nOf course, I was never given the opportunity to form either of those relationships with my son. My wife left me, and took him with her. It broke my damned heart.\n\nIn a way, I don't blame her. My case was an unusual one and I stand by the philosophy that not seeking out the names on your wrist can still lead to a thoroughly fulfilling life. \n\nI like to think my wife could have chanced my name on one wrist, but 'fate' had other plans for me... No, my son did not have my name on one bloody wrist, but on *BOTH*!\n\n*I mean what is that even supposed to mean?!* \n\nI tried to tell my wife that it's probably two separate people with the same name as me. I begged, I pleaded. She wouldn't have anything like that. \n\nI had no idea that this woman I had loved for over a decade would leave me so soon over something so trivial. I had not seen any of this coming. It shook me to my core. It made me drink. It made me take drugs. It made me gamble away my life savings.\n\nI even lost my prosthetic hands in a game of black jack...\n\nOh, sorry. I can see you were confused by that last bit? Yes I have prosthetic hands. *Why do you think I never saw this coming?* Here let me show you... these are my new one's. Got them on loan. They're pretty cool - respond to electrical signals from electrodes on surrounding muscles. Not the most precise or responsive thing in the world but still pretty wicked. Let's me hold my cock when I need to take a piss.\n\nOne car crash, hazy memory and a double amputation will do this to you. They had to remove my gangrenous arms, after they found them with the antlers of the deer I had hit in them. No more sodding wrist tattoos for me!\n\n\nNow you can understand why I never saw this coming. I don't have my wrists, and I couldn't remember the names on my wrists when we named our son. U strongly suspect I had his name on both my wrists too.....\n\nHere gimme a cigarette. Cheers. Maybe have one yourself? No? Okay..\n\nSo anyway to make a long story short, i'm seeing my son now. Kid appeared at my door last month.\n\nBoy's 17 now, run away from home, hates his mum. I have him living with me in my apartment. Bit of a tight squeeze but we are getting on like peas in a pod.\n\nI can't wait to prove the whole world wrong..."], [1, "Names are weird. I mean, why do they really matter? One the one hand, you get assigned a name, and go on with your life, which would most likely be only minimally different if you went by something else. Okay, sometimes maybe it does matter, like for draft lotteries and things like that, but even that's something completely random. Your name does not say anything real about you, for the most part. But, I guess there is one time when it matters, when it might actually say something about who you are as a person. Maybe this philosophical jibber-jabber is boring you, I wish it was boring me, but \"what's in a name?\" is a really important question for me. \n\n\nIt makes sense that everyone takes names so seriously. When someone's name can tell you that they are the one, or that they might try to kill you with a branch from the tree over there, it makes sense that you would want to know who that person is.  Different people begin to appreciate it at different times, some are obtrusively asking everyone for them name from the age of five. Others, like me, take a little longer. Maybe they have trouble getting the importance of either soulmate or enemy, maybe they're more scared of cooties than death, or maybe they're just too awkward to cold call random people for their name. I was a little different. I was confused. The greater idea of the names made sense, but mine were special. Both arms said Emily Jo Wright.\n\n\nMy parents tell me that I caused quite a stir in the hospital when I was born. Nobody in the ward had ever seen a case like mine. Experts were called, research was done, but not a single person with identical tattoos could be found. Obviously, a search began for an Emily Jo Wright, but only two could be found, one of whom was eighty-six, the other, fifteen, but neither bore my name on either arm (A part of me thinks the whole soulmate on your arm thing is quite cruel. Those who fail to find them never seem to really feel satisfied, but at least whoever up there that did this lets all the soulmates match up). But since then, silence. It is against the law to share someone's enemy without their permission, and Emily Jo Wright becomes a lot less interesting when nobody actually knows that she shows up twice. \n\n\nMost of my life, I was unsure what to think. Part of me wants to meet Emily, part of me dreads that day. But what I really wonder is if she is one person or two. It would be fairly poetic for my soulmate and enemy to be the same person, but I feel like the universe could toy with me much more easily if they are different. Like, if I meet Emily, fall in love, and we live together happily, only for me to meet my end when she reveals herself to be my enemy. Or, even worse, I meet soulmate Emily, can never really trust her, ruin our relationship, and am killed by the alcoholism I develop to cope with the stress. I'm a fun guy, aren't I? \n\n\nGeez, what am I talking about? You're working, I shouldn't be taking up all your time. The guy on the other end of the bar looks like he's gonna flip if you don't help him soon. But before you go, now I feel like I have to ask, \"what's your name?\"\n\n\"Emily Jo Wright\""], [1, "Clementine awoke to the sun in her eyes and the fond fading memories of her dreams. She had been riding horse-back through a meadow with the sun to her back and a cool autumn breeze blowing through her long flowing hair. She was with her best friend, Jeremiah, and they were laughing about things that had happened at school that day.\n\nShe walked to the bathroom to wash the sleep from her eyes and scratched at her left wrist tattoo. Her whole life she had known that one tattoo was her enemy and the other her soulmate but there was no real pattern to know which one was which. So far it appeared it was split almost evenly on which wrist would have which name. She looked down to see Jeremiah\u2019s name on her left wrist. \n\nHer best friend had been her left tattoo and the only person of the two names she knew. The other name she had never met. There had never been any strife in their friendship and it was like they were twins separated at birth. They shared all of their secrets and did almost everything together. She checked her phone and saw a text message appear from Anna \u201cDon\u2019t forget, second period quiz today\u201d. \n\nAnna was her other best friend and always had her back in school. Everyone at school made jokes that Jeremiah and Clementine would be high school sweet hearts when they both got over their \u201csecret fear\u201d of being enemies and just give romance a try. The truth was that they weren\u2019t scared at all but rather that Jeremiah had looked up the other name on his wrist and wasn\u2019t sure what to make of her. She was beautiful with a kind looking smile, big blue eyes and a flawless complexion. Clementine felt inferior to this other girl and so she never pushed the subject of dating.\n\nClementine was curious about her other name but never to the extent of looking them up like Jeremiah had done. Her other name was Colton Miolock and he would remain a complete mystery to her until the day he showed up and revealed whether or not he was the enemy or the soulmate. \n\nAs Clementine slid into her summer flats and finished brushing her teeth, she made one final check to make sure she looked okay in the mirror then ran for the door grabbing her messenger bag backpack off the back of the dining room chair she always strung it over after school. She made it out to the curb just in time for Anna to pull up to give her a ride to school. They shared the same classes for the first half of the day and lived about a block apart so it made sense to carpool, especially since Anna had a car and Clementine did not. \n\nWalking into class for first hour, Anna nudged at Clementine\u2019s shoulder to get her attention and nodded to the back of the room. \u201cHey Clem, new guy. He\u2019s cute\u201d Anna whispered. Clementine agreed, he was definitely good looking. He had a handsome face with dark brown hair, rich brown eyes and appeared to be laughing with one of the other guys in class. His smile was sinister but made him look that much more handsome. Rather than open her mouth and look foolish, Clementine just nodded at Anna and giggled with her as they took their seats. \n\nThe teacher looked up from his desk when the bell rang and cleared his throat to begin class. \u201cAs some of you have noticed, we have a new student. Colton, will you please stand up and introduce yourself to everyone. Please tell us what you enjoy doing outside of school and what brought you to us.\u201d The eyes in the room seemed to be going back and forth for a moment as they shifted from the teacher, to Clementine then finally to the new guy. Several of her classmates knew the names of each other\u2019s wrists. They were often the favorite topic for daydreaming and teasing. Clementine felt a very sudden unease in her stomach, like there was a tornado ripping through her guts as she nervously waited for his introduction.\n\n\u201cSure. I am Colton Miolock. I enjoy travelling with my family, rock climbing and drawing. I am here because my bonehead dad had to go get a promotion at work that required him to move.\u201d He laughed when he called his dad a bonehead, indicating it was in jest and not out of the normal teenage spite against their parents. When the teacher cocked his head to the side, Colton followed it up with \u201cI am just kidding about my dad being a bonehead, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease feel free to sit back down. Welcome and thank you for joining us.\u201d The teacher picked up his notebook of notes and proceeded to lecture on last night\u2019s reading assignment. Clementine struggled to pay attention, even when the teacher announced that something was important to note. Her head was spinning and she couldn\u2019t feel her chair anymore. When the bell rang she realized she didn\u2019t hear the assignment for that night and rose to follow her classmates out to the next class. \n\nAnna grabbed her arm in the hallway and dragged her into a bathroom a few doors away from the classroom. As soon as the door quietly closed behind them, Anna turned on Clementine and began talking about their new classmate. She caught the questions and statements in blurs. \u201cWhich one do you suppose he is?\u201d \u201cYou are lucky, both of your names are super cute.\u201d \u201cAre you going to approach him?\u201d \u201cYou should introduce yourself.\u201d Clementine leaned against one of the sinks behind her and grabbed her friend by the shoulders and shook her twice.\n\n\u201cAnna. What was our homework?\u201d Clementine said in a mild panic. Anna stopped talking long enough to stare into Clementine\u2019s face like she was confused about something then started laughing hysterically at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cClems, the second name on your wrist shows up today and you are worried about the homework assignment? How in the world you manage to keep any priorities straight is beyond me.\u201d Anna giggled and applied a new coat of lip gloss in the mirror. \u201cAlright, crazy, let\u2019s get to our next class before we are late.\u201d\n\nThe day proceeded as normal for the rest of the morning until lunch. When Clementine was walking towards the cafeteria she heard Jeremiah down another hallway opposite of where she was heading to meet him. She could hear that he was upset in the way he was talking so she approached quietly and listened to hear the words being exchanged. \u201cLook, Clems doesn\u2019t need to know this, alright. I have been protecting her for as long as I have known her and this will just complicate our situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I know is that someone asked if I planned to replace you or become the mysterious enemy. I am not here to cause any problems. I simply asked if you two were love interests so I knew if I should approach her or avoid her and prevent problems for myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAvoid her and avoid me. Things are perfectly fine the way they were before you showed up today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright man, I get it. She is off-limits. At least tell me which one she is so I know who I am avoiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind a free seat at lunch and stay away from me. Clems will be one of the two sitting with me. As a matter of fact, avoid both of the girls with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for your honesty, man.\u201d Jeremiah didn\u2019t respond to the last statement but instead huffed and walked towards where Clementine was hiding around the corner. She ran to the lunchroom and cut the line to stand with Anna and grab her food. \n\nThey all sat at the table picking away at their cafeteria food. Today was the dreaded \u201chotdish\u201d day. No one could really pinpoint any real ingredients other than slime. Clementine had decided to eat her apple and drink her milk in silence instead. Anna finally broke the quiet by asking if Jeremiah had met the new kid yet. Jeremiah shot her look of warning and only said \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nThe table went quiet again for a few moments longer until Anna tried again by changing the subject and turned to Clementine to talk about the homework assignment for the first class. They were exchanging grievances at having to read so much when Clementine saw Colton walk past their table.

But I always felt she was a step ahead of me.\n\nEven during sex we both had weapons hidden close by. The reward for murdering the enemy sketched on you was enlightenment. Marrying the soulmate was a promise to eternal afterlife. \n\nNo one knows what this sick game is. But it's been documented for as long as the history records go.

You don't even need to ask *me* about it, it was all over the goddamned news! FOX, CNN, NBC, TYT, the whole works. \n\nYeah, go on... do a quick google search on my name...No? Good.\n\nI see you don't give a flying fuck what mainstream media outlets and biased, tabloid internet news tells you.\n\nI...guess I could tell you my side of the story. That is if you are interested? Well then, You might want to order us some coffee.\n\nSo, here goes...The gist of what headlines will tell you is that my son was born 'special' - A euphemism for being born with my name on him. \n\nNow, as you know- to have a parents name on one's wrist is not altogether that uncommon. Sadly, it does happen in some rare cases. \n\nIf this happens you're screwed. It doesn't matter if you're going to be your child's worst enemy, or their soulmate - as a parent both connotations are terrible. If you're the child's enemy you are labelled a 'potential child killer', If you're the child's soul mate the label becomes - 'potential incestuous paedophile'. \n\nDon't know which one of those I prefer really...\n\nWe call children who bear their parents names on them the \"in immunditiis filiorum\" or IMFs for short - means \"dirty children\" in Latin. It's not a term without controversy, after all it's not the babe's fault that it is born with those names on it's wrist! \n\nNor is it necessarily the parents fault I'd argue. \n\nI concede that statistically speaking, there is an undeniable correlation between the names you have on your wrist and the relationships you form with the people to whom those names belong to. This has been considered fact as long as I can remember.\n\nThe thing is - there's no science behind that bullshit. It's all religious, spirituality nonsense. Until they can come up with a verifiable hypothesis as to why this phenomenon occurs I refuse to believe that \"fate\" is a thing. \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul\" - I love that quote.\n\nStereotypes towards the parents of IMFs are bullshit anyway. I believe the tattoos have much more subtle implications than \"killer\" and \"incestuous pig\". \n\nThe two simply imply the most positive and the most negative relationships you will have in your life. It isn't any more complicated than that! You can be a \"soulmate\" by platonically being someones best friend and you can be an \"enemy\" through the simple act of being a bad influence!  \n\nOf course, I was never given the opportunity to form either of those relationships with my son. My wife left me, and took him with her. It broke my damned heart.\n\nIn a way, I don't blame her. My case was an unusual one and I stand by the philosophy that not seeking out the names on your wrist can still lead to a thoroughly fulfilling life. \n\nI like to think my wife could have chanced my name on one wrist, but 'fate' had other plans for me... No, my son did not have my name on one bloody wrist, but on *BOTH*!\n\n*I mean what is that even supposed to mean?!* \n\nI tried to tell my wife that it's probably two separate people with the same name as me. I begged, I pleaded. She wouldn't have anything like that. \n\nI had no idea that this woman I had loved for over a decade would leave me so soon over something so trivial. I had not seen any of this coming. It shook me to my core. It made me drink. It made me take drugs. It made me gamble away my life savings.\n\nI even lost my prosthetic hands in a game of black jack...\n\nOh, sorry. I can see you were confused by that last bit? Yes I have prosthetic hands. *Why do you think I never saw this coming?* Here let me show you... these are my new one's. Got them on loan. They're pretty cool - respond to electrical signals from electrodes on surrounding muscles. Not the most precise or responsive thing in the world but still pretty wicked. Let's me hold my cock when I need to take a piss.\n\nOne car crash, hazy memory and a double amputation will do this to you. They had to remove my gangrenous arms, after they found them with the antlers of the deer I had hit in them. No more sodding wrist tattoos for me!\n\n\nNow you can understand why I never saw this coming. I don't have my wrists, and I couldn't remember the names on my wrists when we named our son. U strongly suspect I had his name on both my wrists too.....\n\nHere gimme a cigarette. Cheers. Maybe have one yourself? No? Okay..\n\nSo anyway to make a long story short, i'm seeing my son now. Kid appeared at my door last month.\n\nBoy's 17 now, run away from home, hates his mum. I have him living with me in my apartment.

One the one hand, you get assigned a name, and go on with your life, which would most likely be only minimally different if you went by something else. Okay, sometimes maybe it does matter, like for draft lotteries and things like that, but even that's something completely random. Your name does not say anything real about you, for the most part. But, I guess there is one time when it matters, when it might actually say something about who you are as a person. Maybe this philosophical jibber-jabber is boring you, I wish it was boring me, but \"what's in a name?\" is a really important question for me. \n\n\nIt makes sense that everyone takes names so seriously. When someone's name can tell you that they are the one, or that they might try to kill you with a branch from the tree over there, it makes sense that you would want to know who that person is.  Different people begin to appreciate it at different times, some are obtrusively asking everyone for them name from the age of five. Others, like me, take a little longer. Maybe they have trouble getting the importance of either soulmate or enemy, maybe they're more scared of cooties than death, or maybe they're just too awkward to cold call random people for their name. I was a little different. I was confused. The greater idea of the names made sense, but mine were special. Both arms said Emily Jo Wright.\n\n\nMy parents tell me that I caused quite a stir in the hospital when I was born. Nobody in the ward had ever seen a case like mine. Experts were called, research was done, but not a single person with identical tattoos could be found. Obviously, a search began for an Emily Jo Wright, but only two could be found, one of whom was eighty-six, the other, fifteen, but neither bore my name on either arm (A part of me thinks the whole soulmate on your arm thing is quite cruel. Those who fail to find them never seem to really feel satisfied, but at least whoever up there that did this lets all the soulmates match up). But since then, silence. It is against the law to share someone's enemy without their permission, and Emily Jo Wright becomes a lot less interesting when nobody actually knows that she shows up twice. \n\n\nMost of my life, I was unsure what to think. Part of me wants to meet Emily, part of me dreads that day. But what I really wonder is if she is one person or two. It would be fairly poetic for my soulmate and enemy to be the same person, but I feel like the universe could toy with me much more easily if they are different. Like, if I meet Emily, fall in love, and we live together happily, only for me to meet my end when she reveals herself to be my enemy. Or, even worse, I meet soulmate Emily, can never really trust her, ruin our relationship, and am killed by the alcoholism I develop to cope with the stress. I'm a fun guy, aren't I? \n\n\nGeez, what am I talking about? You're working, I shouldn't be taking up all your time. The guy on the other end of the bar looks like he's gonna flip if you don't help him soon. But before you go, now I feel like I have to ask, \"what's your name?\"\n\n\"Emily Jo Wright\"", "id": "d4k23ut"}], [{"comment": "Clementine awoke to the sun in her eyes and the fond fading memories of her dreams. She had been riding horse-back through a meadow with the sun to her back and a cool autumn breeze blowing through her long flowing hair. She was with her best friend, Jeremiah, and they were laughing about things that had happened at school that day.\n\nShe walked to the bathroom to wash the sleep from her eyes and scratched at her left wrist tattoo. Her whole life she had known that one tattoo was her enemy and the other her soulmate but there was no real pattern to know which one was which. So far it appeared it was split almost evenly on which wrist would have which name. She looked down to see Jeremiah\u2019s name on her left wrist. \n\nHer best friend had been her left tattoo and the only person of the two names she knew. The other name she had never met. There had never been any strife in their friendship and it was like they were twins separated at birth. They shared all of their secrets and did almost everything together. She checked her phone and saw a text message appear from Anna \u201cDon\u2019t forget, second period quiz today\u201d. \n\nAnna was her other best friend and always had her back in school. Everyone at school made jokes that Jeremiah and Clementine would be high school sweet hearts when they both got over their \u201csecret fear\u201d of being enemies and just give romance a try. The truth was that they weren\u2019t scared at all but rather that Jeremiah had looked up the other name on his wrist and wasn\u2019t sure what to make of her. She was beautiful with a kind looking smile, big blue eyes and a flawless complexion. Clementine felt inferior to this other girl and so she never pushed the subject of dating.\n\nClementine was curious about her other name but never to the extent of looking them up like Jeremiah had done. Her other name was Colton Miolock and he would remain a complete mystery to her until the day he showed up and revealed whether or not he was the enemy or the soulmate. \n\nAs Clementine slid into her summer flats and finished brushing her teeth, she made one final check to make sure she looked okay in the mirror then ran for the door grabbing her messenger bag backpack off the back of the dining room chair she always strung it over after school. She made it out to the curb just in time for Anna to pull up to give her a ride to school. They shared the same classes for the first half of the day and lived about a block apart so it made sense to carpool, especially since Anna had a car and Clementine did not. \n\nWalking into class for first hour, Anna nudged at Clementine\u2019s shoulder to get her attention and nodded to the back of the room. \u201cHey Clem, new guy. He\u2019s cute\u201d Anna whispered. Clementine agreed, he was definitely good looking. He had a handsome face with dark brown hair, rich brown eyes and appeared to be laughing with one of the other guys in class. His smile was sinister but made him look that much more handsome. Rather than open her mouth and look foolish, Clementine just nodded at Anna and giggled with her as they took their seats. \n\nThe teacher looked up from his desk when the bell rang and cleared his throat to begin class. \u201cAs some of you have noticed, we have a new student. Colton, will you please stand up and introduce yourself to everyone. Please tell us what you enjoy doing outside of school and what brought you to us.\u201d The eyes in the room seemed to be going back and forth for a moment as they shifted from the teacher, to Clementine then finally to the new guy. Several of her classmates knew the names of each other\u2019s wrists. They were often the favorite topic for daydreaming and teasing. Clementine felt a very sudden unease in her stomach, like there was a tornado ripping through her guts as she nervously waited for his introduction.\n\n\u201cSure. I am Colton Miolock. I enjoy travelling with my family, rock climbing and drawing. I am here because my bonehead dad had to go get a promotion at work that required him to move.\u201d He laughed when he called his dad a bonehead, indicating it was in jest and not out of the normal teenage spite against their parents. When the teacher cocked his head to the side, Colton followed it up with \u201cI am just kidding about my dad being a bonehead, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease feel free to sit back down. Welcome and thank you for joining us.\u201d The teacher picked up his notebook of notes and proceeded to lecture on last night\u2019s reading assignment. Clementine struggled to pay attention, even when the teacher announced that something was important to note. Her head was spinning and she couldn\u2019t feel her chair anymore. When the bell rang she realized she didn\u2019t hear the assignment for that night and rose to follow her classmates out to the next class. \n\nAnna grabbed her arm in the hallway and dragged her into a bathroom a few doors away from the classroom. As soon as the door quietly closed behind them, Anna turned on Clementine and began talking about their new classmate. She caught the questions and statements in blurs. \u201cWhich one do you suppose he is?\u201d \u201cYou are lucky, both of your names are super cute.\u201d \u201cAre you going to approach him?\u201d \u201cYou should introduce yourself.\u201d Clementine leaned against one of the sinks behind her and grabbed her friend by the shoulders and shook her twice.\n\n\u201cAnna. What was our homework?\u201d Clementine said in a mild panic. Anna stopped talking long enough to stare into Clementine\u2019s face like she was confused about something then started laughing hysterically at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cClems, the second name on your wrist shows up today and you are worried about the homework assignment? How in the world you manage to keep any priorities straight is beyond me.\u201d Anna giggled and applied a new coat of lip gloss in the mirror. \u201cAlright, crazy, let\u2019s get to our next class before we are late.\u201d\n\nThe day proceeded as normal for the rest of the morning until lunch. When Clementine was walking towards the cafeteria she heard Jeremiah down another hallway opposite of where she was heading to meet him. She could hear that he was upset in the way he was talking so she approached quietly and listened to hear the words being exchanged. \u201cLook, Clems doesn\u2019t need to know this, alright. I have been protecting her for as long as I have known her and this will just complicate our situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I know is that someone asked if I planned to replace you or become the mysterious enemy. I am not here to cause any problems. I simply asked if you two were love interests so I knew if I should approach her or avoid her and prevent problems for myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAvoid her and avoid me. Things are perfectly fine the way they were before you showed up today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright man, I get it. She is off-limits. At least tell me which one she is so I know who I am avoiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind a free seat at lunch and stay away from me. Clems will be one of the two sitting with me. As a matter of fact, avoid both of the girls with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for your honesty, man.\u201d Jeremiah didn\u2019t respond to the last statement but instead huffed and walked towards where Clementine was hiding around the corner. She ran to the lunchroom and cut the line to stand with Anna and grab her food. \n\nThey all sat at the table picking away at their cafeteria food. Today was the dreaded \u201chotdish\u201d day. No one could really pinpoint any real ingredients other than slime. Clementine had decided to eat her apple and drink her milk in silence instead. Anna finally broke the quiet by asking if Jeremiah had met the new kid yet. Jeremiah shot her look of warning and only said \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nThe table went quiet again for a few moments longer until Anna tried again by changing the subject and turned to Clementine to talk about the homework assignment for the first class. They were exchanging grievances at having to read so much when Clementine saw Colton walk past their table. Colton smiled at Clementine then ever so slightly, turned his wrist to her with her name on it. He had drawn a very small heart beside her name. Just as quickly, he pocketed his hand. \n\nAs soon as he was out of earshot, Clementine looked Jeremiah in the eyes and asked him point blank what his problem was today. Anna gasped and covered her mouth. \u201cYou want to know what my problem is today? Yeah? Okay. I don\u2019t like that on the same day that my second name shows up, so does yours. I don\u2019t like that yours approached me but mine chose to avoid me and then sent your second name to me to find out if we are dating.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why are you upset at that question?\u201d she asked, feeling annoyed.\n\n\u201cThe question doesn\u2019t bother me. Knowing that my competition has shown up and he has eyes for both of my names bothers me.\u201d He said this also sounding annoyed for having to explain himself to her. \n\nClementine chewed on the thought for a moment then spat out, \u201cso you want to test the waters with her first to find out if you should be with me or hate me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. What?

Whenever I see myself on the news, a part of me excites that doesn't normally exist. I feel the way I imagine a child does when it wakes up on Christmas day to a nice present; perhaps a more matured feeling, such as what flows through a mother does when her child graduates college. I guess that's all speculation, since I've known none of it myself. Now that I think about it, that's probably why I am the way I am.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, it's not enough. It's never enough; I am not satiated by the petty deaths of passing strangers who look at me the wrong way. I love the hunt, the thrill and the adrenaline, but it's the *content* that really matters. I want to pry the life from someone's body with force and feel like I've accomplished something.\n\nAnd so now is the cultivation of all my efforts and learnings- tonight is what my life has lead up to. I will no longer be afraid of him and take my frustrations out on worthless lives...I will kill my father, and take a scalpel to the prideful arrogance in his heart.\n\nHe, like me, was a serial killer. His body count was close to 200 by now, since he'd been doing it since I was a kid, and he was a true professional. No criminal investigators of any kind have even deemed him as a suspect since he started his work, if that gives you an idea of his skill. However, I know something no one else does: I know where he lives.\n\nIf you're wondering how, it's far more flagrant than interesting. I didn't track him down, he literally told me where to find him. Eight years ago, I was escaping the hellhole he called a household to be free and live a life outside of fear and pain. Before I even made it past the front gate, he'd somehow gotten in front of me.\n\n\"This is the address of where I stay before a hunt,\" he told me, shoving a slip of paper into my shirt pocket. \"If you aren't dead within a year, seek me. If you hate me so much, come to me with skill and determination. But let me warn you, child. If you come to this address, and you cannot end my life, I will end yours. You mean nothing to me.\"\n\nThat's my father, in all his greatness. Everyone else in my family had died years before, so it was just the two of us for most of my life. I tried to run from home so that I wouldn't end up like him, but I guess it was too late for me. I've killed innocent people to prepare myself for this night, but I know that somewhere, deep within my soul, I enjoyed it. That scares me more than the prospect of death.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNight fell upon the city, and I set out after packing my toolkit. *Tonight's going to be a long, long night.*\n\nI'd watched his little townhouse from a distance for the past year, and I know the rituals he holds as habit. Every Friday night, he goes into the house and checks on his inventory- I know he's also checking to make sure no one has been inside. Some nights, he decides to go hunting. Other nights, he simply heads home. Tonight, I saw him packing a small pouch with blades, lockpicks and tools to cover his tracks with.\n\n*He's found a victim. This is my chance.*\n\nBefore my father sets out on a hunt, he always meditates at this creepy altar in a closet with candles and incense lit on it. I can't fully make out what else is in that closet, but that doesn't matter- when he's meditating, he has no weapons on him. That's when I'll strike.\n\nSure enough, he sat by the wooden alter after lighting several candles and sticks of incense. When his hands raised above his heads and clapped together, I knew he was focused on his meditation, and I slipped in through the kitchen window with a long, sharp blade in my hands. I slithered up to him, pressing the coldness of steel against his neck. \n\n*This is it. This is the end.*\n\nVillainous laughter filled my ears, echoing through the small bedroom. He didn't try to fight back or disarm me, he just...laughed, and lifted his head up toward the closet. I followed his eyes and realized that the candle light was enough to see inside.\n\nKaren. Robbie. John. Grandma. Mom. Faces I hadn't seen since I was a child, yet memories of them became clear as day in my mind. Their heads were in jars of greenish liquid, bobbing ever so lightly. All were grimacing, as if aware of their fate. Their faces had been peeling slightly, the bits of skin floating near the lids.\n\nHis laughter grew louder as I reeled back in a horror few have known. My father stood up and turned to me, with an empty jar in his hand and a look of pure, murderous insanity on his face.\n\nThere was a small sticker on the jar that I somehow noticed, despite my fear. It had been written on.\n\n'*James*'."], [41, "What idiots. They all were. Are. Every human. Look how they love, look how they care for one another. The obsequity, it's nauseating. But, I can endure all this; I can endure their emotions and their appreciation for one another, as long as they make no attempt to extend their perverse, caring appendages towards me. Leave me to my shadows; leave me to apricate within the dark that no one else can see. The light of kindness burns. I am, despite what people say, a most fragile individual. I can bend, I can twist with the blows and lacerations thrown by caring coevals, but I feel every twist, it sends cold frissons down my hunched spine. I kill. Have I mentioned that yet? No? Well now you know. Now you cannot plead ignorance in regard to the person to whom you're listening. Look how close we are. Look. I type, you read. I think, you understand. We are one, you and I, connected more than any other two individuals can be. \n\nMy licentiousness, the repugnancy of my thought, does not render the exterior world as being some hermetically sealed utopia into which I may never be granted access. Granted! How amusing that you should think that I would wish entry into your stygian city. I pass through on occasion, I have to, *I* still have to live. That can't be said for everyone, you know. But I can walk past a thousand people, each time I do I cringe, their presence cuts me, draws the air from my lungs into the surrounding atmosphere, where it encircles my body, dancing around, taunting my breathless attempts to inhale. Eventually my ambulation takes me past, and my breath, having finished its derision, returns to its resting place beside my heart. These people, they do not invoke within me the feelings that have made me famous. I am famous you know? My name is known by all, passed on only in whisper. *\"Don't give him what he desires\"* they say to one another, in cautious self-righteousness, as if *they* have anything *I* might want. How arrogant, would you not agree? To acquit them of their lives may be warranted, true, but it would be no work of art, no thing of beauty. And is not that the point of everything, beauty? It is for me.\n\nI said that I could pass by the faces that stumble through streets, from home to work, and work to home. They're hardly even faces; ideas, perhaps, a careless thought. But, the beautiful individual, I cannot simply pass *her* by. No, certainly not. She is not innocent. Well, no one is, are they reader? I am struck by beauty, not in the appreciative sense, but by a most motivating paroxysm, which induces in the langorous sinews of my pale body, an inimical intention. How can I let beauty exist; how can I let beauty haunt the world, taunt the world. You hate it don't you? They way it smiles, the way it laughs with a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders, and an inclination of the head such that the white teeth are revealed between the parted, pink swellings that sit beneath that infuriating, breathing, nose. And it always laughs, have you noticed that? Beauty never seems to suffer, at least, not without me. That is why I exist. Everyone, it is said, exists for a reason. Just as your purpose is to read what I write, and nothing more, my purpose is simple, rid the world, *my* world, of that  chancre of beauty. And so, whenever I see her, in all her different forms - perhaps today she wears blonde hair and a skin polished by the sun's careful caress, or maybe, she adorns herself in a brunette wig and caesious eyes, with a redolence that is oh so most appealing - it is my duty, my one purpose, to rid us, rid *you*, of this pestilential problem.\n\nThere was, I noted the other day, one individual in particular. Her hair possessed all the blackness of a sky that sits in dreary anticipation of the dawn, the sun not yet having revealed herself from her hiding place, and the moon lying, scratching, clawing at the horizon in hope that she would soon give way to light; but she doesn't. Her skin was pale, a white that seemed it would have had the capacity to inspire the blind with new-found vision. A labrose female was she, strolling in her high-heeled gait that inclined itself so perfectly in a straight line that would might suspect she were on rails - but who isn't? Oh beauty, do you never learn? Why do you keep walking before me like this, you know it will end the same way? I have returned your anthropomorphic appendages to you before, and I shall do so again with this one. I followed her, and before long she arrived at what as assuredly her home. I noted the address, colour of the door (black, who would have guessed?), and the shutters on the window that seemed a quasi-military in their strength. I suppose she too detests the light; every thorn has its rose I suppose.\n\nI returned that evening. Indeed, I'm here now. I can see a silhouette, a feminine adumbration through the slits of the window. The door is ajar. How naive, but they always are, aren't they reader? I pushed it and it crept open as if it knew the urgent nature of my silence. Within my left hand was sat, most calmly, my faithful friend; 7 inches in length, and glistening in a hushed way beneath the moon's weary gaze. The door on the left. Yes. She must be there. Her silhouette was. She had not moved, could not have moved. She was against the rear window. My foot steps were silent, my heart, as if in perfect harmony with the silence that my carefulness was singing, beat in a muffled caution. Step. Inhale. Step. Exhale. My breath must have been singeing her hair as she stared, unaware, into the distance. I could feel her, not with my hands, but by the mere observation of her proximity to death, I could feel it. Step. Step. Raise my blade. Raise my right hand. I lunged. Calculated. The blade sank into my victim. She did not scream. She did not flinch. She was not stabbed. She was not there. I withdrew my knife from the cushion, but I then heard the silence of a killer. I felt beauty's nauseating breath upon my shoulder, her sibulent exhalations were suffocating, but it was the entry of something sharp into the skin with which I had so delicately covered my bony back that truly stole my life from me. It was my purpose I suppose. I had always lived in darkness, it only makes sense that I should cease to live there too."], [9, "Tonight is the night.  I've been waiting for this moment for so long; I've had to be so careful, so cautious to avoid being caught, but tonight, everything is set.  As I walk, I an barely contain the ecstasy brewing deep within me.  I haven't indulged myself in *weeks*, and every day has been a mounting challenge to keep my urges constrained and under control.  But not for much longer.\n\nIt took hours, but I finally found her.  The woman of my dreams, the object of my desires.  I don't know who she is, but she'll know me in ways she can't even imagine.  As I follow her now, tracing behind in the shadows, waiting for her to lead me somewhere we begin, my heart races at the thought of that first incision.  My blood boils imagining the look in her eyes.  My soul quivers at the idea of...the idea of my....when she...\n\n......hang on a minute.  I know this street.  I've definitely been here before.  But, that doesn't matter.  What matters is that, soon, I'll be able to plunge the two of us into our dark ritual.  That feverish dance which haunts my dreams and titillates my desires like nothi- \n\nAlright, no.  Hold on; we just crossed onto West Evergreen, and I *definitely* fucking know that one for some reason.  For the goddamn life of me though, I can't figure out wh- Oh, Jesus Christ, are you serious?!\n\n\"......Diane?\"\n\nShe turns around, and her eyes go as wide as mine as we see each other clearly for the first time.\n\n\"Oh my God, Zeke, is that you?!?\"\n\n\"Diane!  I can't believe this; what are the fucking odds?!\"\n\n\"I know!  How longs it been?  Two months, I think?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I think we both went to Colin's housewarming, didn't we?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right!  Oh, man, no wonder I can hardly remember.  I had to have Ian drive us back that night.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you two still together then?\"\n\n\"Yep; we actually just from a wine tour over in California!\"\n\n\"Oh, I've been dying to go to one of those!  That's fantastic.  Still working over and Coleman and Setlzer's?\"\n\n\"Yeah, still rocking that 9 to 5; you know how it is.  You, uh, you still doing that freelance writing biz?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I, uh, I had to go and get something a bit more steady.  Actually a manger over at Gustman's now.  Still doing a bit on the side though, so, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, you should!  Ian and I were just talking about you the other day actually; that one piece you had on McSweeney's was hilarious.  You really need to keep that up; you'll get there.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, that's the dream and all.\"\n\n\"Gotta stand by your dreams.  So, if you're one of us working stiffs now, what brings you out here this late?\"\n\nI shift awkwardly in my stance a bit, trying to think of the words.\n\n\"Uh....well, actually, I was....I mean, I didn't *know* it was you, so I was kinda setting up to...well...\"\n\n\"Oh my God, were you going to *murder* me?!\"\n\nWe're whispering now, trying to keep from being overheard.\n\n\"No!  I mean, not *you*; if I had known it were you, I would ha-\"\n\n\"No, no, Zeke, relax!  It's okay; I was totally going to murder you too!\"\n\n\"What?  You're kidding; you didn't even know I w-\"\n\n\"Zeke, you're not half as stealthy as you think you are.  You really need to work on your technique; I caught you coming about five blocks ago.\"\n\n\"Christ, you're kidding.  I knew I shouldn't have tried to do this when the moon was full.  But were you really going to kill me?\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely!  See, I was leading you back to my place so I could knock you out and strap you to the dissection table I have in my basement.\"\n\n\"Really?  You've got a full dissection table?  I was just going to drug you so I could slice you open in your bed.  When you'd have the table installed?\"\n\n\"Just last month!  It's honestly the best; once you start using one, you can't even imagine going back to before.  It's so much easier to keep them restrained, you know?  You want to come by and check it out?\"\n\n\"Could I?  I don't want to intrude or anything; it's getting late and all.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it's fine!  I'm sure Ian's still up; he'll be happy to see you, I'm sure!\"\n\nWith a nod, I follow her further down West Evergreen towards her house at the end of the street.  Dark urges can wait; I've *got* to see if she can give me the number for a good table guy."], [7, "Kate and I were on our third date; I was walking her home. Like many other Tinderellas, she was hot, confident, and had a bit of princess-like arrogance in her. The perfect mark. They never saw me coming. I mean, technically they *did* see me come... Shut up. Don't make me slit your throat.\n\nAs we rounded the corner into her neighborhood, Kate pressed her body close to mine and whispered by my ear, \"I'm going to do crazy things to you tonight.\" \n\nI smiled genuinely for the first time. \"Me too.\" Good lord. I love Tinderellas.\n\nFinally we reached her house; her 90 square feet coffin. Kate unlocked the door while gazing at me with lustful thirst. I leaned in to kiss those sweet lips one last time. Our hands roamed each other's bodies, her torso pushed against mine, and we kissed like young teenagers kissing for the first time. \n\nGasping for air, Kate grinned foxily and exhaled, \"Go on in.\" She eyed the door, signalling me to enter first.\n\nNo way I was doing that. I learnt this rule the hard way: never turn your back on your mark. It's too much exposure.\n\nInstead, I spun Kate around forcefully so her back was turned on me. Classic dominance move. \"Ladies first,\" I said, nudging her with my hands on her waist.\n\nBut then Kate wriggled out of my hold casually. \"Baby, I prepared a surprise for you inside. Go in first!\"\n\n\"No, you first!\" I said.\n\n\"Baby,\" she cooed.\n\n\"Come on, it's the same either way.\"\n\n\"Yes, so just-\"\n\nI kicked the door and shoved her in; she stumbled across the room. \n\nJesus Christ. \n\nThe living room looked totally different. The TV, sofa, coffee table - everything was gone. In their place was a translucent plastic tarp which lined the insides of the room. There was no mistaking it: I was Kate's prey, and her four walls were waiting to taste my blood.\n\nI stared at her. She was eyeing me with a look of shock and fury.\n\n\"What the fuck? You're a killer too?\" I said.\n\n\"What are you talking-\" Kate suddenly fell silent. \"Did you just say 'too'?\"\n\nI couldn't help it. I burst out laughing.\n\n\"Fuck, man. This is unreal.\"\n\nShe started to laugh as well, in a fashion quite similar to Kate, surprisingly.\n\n\"Well, I'm Mike.\" I approached her with an extended hand. \"Nice to meet you...\"\n\n\"Kelly.\" She shook my hand. \"I can't believe this.\" \n\n\"So, did you hire help for this?\" I said, pointing at the room.\n\n\"Nah. Did it myself. It's amazingly efficient.\" She paused and smiled coyly. \"I can show you just how efficient it is, if you'd like.\"\n\n\"Nice try.\"\n\n\"A girl has to try,\" she sighed. \"Anyway, how were you going to kill me?\"\n\nI smiled wryly and held up my stiletto proudly.\n\nKelly giggled, then held a hand to her mouth. \"Sorry, Mike. I just didn't expect such a... traditional tool.\"\n\n\"The hell did you just say?\" I snapped.\n\n\"No offense meant. Just surprised that you would use a knife when guns are so easy to get nowadays.\"\n\nPretentious bitch. *Knife*? This was a fucking custom-made stiletto. With 12 girls' blood on it.\n\n\"Did you know that there are many ways to kill with a 'knife'?\"\n\n\"Really?\" She rolled her eyes so slightly, she thought I wouldn't notice. What a joke. She may have been Kelly, but there was so much Kate in her as well. Too much.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, casually raising the stiletto to eye-level and keeping my eyes trained on her. She still stood there, leaning comfortably against the wall.\n\nThen I hurled the stiletto at that bitch.\n\nIt struck dead center in her forehead and she fell limp to the floor with a sound caught dead in her throat. As crimson blood began flowing out from the wound, she clawed at her neck in a desperate attempt to breathe. From the floor, she stared aghast, gasping for air, straining to say something. Even now, she still wanted to talk. Talk talk talk. Kelly, Kate, they talked too much. Finally, her body twitched. Then a calm swept across her and she rested. Just a pile of bones and skin now. Her eyes, still, were wide open with shock and indignance. Guns, huh?\n\nI told you. The girls never saw me coming."], [2, "I was standing in line waiting for the self-checkout when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around to see a lumbering old man, the kind of overweight that\u2019s not necessarily obese but more reminiscent of a landslide that got bottlenecked at the waist. With a great wheeze to his voice he asked, \u201cWhat size are your shoes young man.\u201d Pondering the various avenues to which this question originated from, without much thought I blurted, \u201cTwelve, sometimes eleven and a half depending on the brand.\u201d A noise that guttural doesn\u2019t quite fully describe almost flew out of his mouth, \u201cahh yea, that\u2019s what I thought. I\u2019m always right.\u201d\n\n\nNow the self-checkout line is simultaneously meditative and infuriating. A current dramatically shifting between shuffling feet, crinkled bags, a steady line of beeps and chatter. A trance into a simple mundanity, so harshly broken by the screech of a misplaced item in the bagging area. The kind of Sunday morning ritual that would eventually drive anybody crazy. Though of course my senses were heightened by the fact that two people were about to murder each other just a few feet to my left. And I knew it was going to happen, and so did they. I was simply a moderator to make sure no one chickened out.\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how it started. Well mostly it\u2019s unclear in the sense that there\u2019s no way I\u2019d write it down. But for better or for worse, I get a rise out of hiring hitmen to kill each other. Plotting carefully orchestrated situations to cause simultaneous death (meaning no payment required) and to create maximum spectacle. My dad always used to lecture me every day before school, \u201cnow son, a half-assed job isn\u2019t accomplishing anything at all.\u201d So I guess I will pinpoint that as the specific moment that jumpstarted this whole hobby. Because of course, as everyone recognizes, Freud was correct in all his assertions.\n\n\nYou know what always gets me though? It\u2019s the fucking jalapenos. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have the code memorized by now. I\u2019m always amazed at how the cashiers can remember all the produce codes when I can\u2019t even remember four digits. You gotta place them on the scanner/weight thing, and spend thirty seconds looking for it. And the goddamn jalapenos aren\u2019t even on the list. So you gotta call an attendant over, but it takes a minute to get their attention because everyone needs their ID checked at the same time buying their rack of Coors Light. And before they have a chance to enter the code in for you, there\u2019s two men\u2019s entrails splayed out all over the ground before you.\n\n\nSo yea, I blame my arrest on the jalapenos. I have this bad habit of coming across as a sociopath to people I meet. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s cause I\u2019m a sociopath, looking at the studies I really doubt it, but the police came and took a statement, and I must have said something wrong. I think it\u2019s cause I told them my jalapeno rant. I mean I confessed, I was too charged up, adrenaline makes you do crazy shit. And I was kinda excited to explain everything to them. The best part though, was I brought that goddamn shoe guesser into the whole mix. I called him my accomplice. And they ate that shit up, gave me a lesser sentence for ratting him out. The old man too senile to even know what happened. Yea, maybe I am a sociopath.\n"], [2, "Amanda...\nRose. Jade. Melanie\nAnd soon... Samantha. With any luck.\n\nI gave the plastic bags one last brush with my fingers before closing the freezer door. Amanda's weren't lasting very well, I hadn't put much thought into storage before Rose, and as the months went on Amanda's just kept getting worse. I really hated the thought of throwing them out, maybe I could find some way to restore them.\n\nI should have finished with Sam weeks ago. She was starting to make friends in town, friends would notice. But Jade had gotten me quite hooked on \"Fuck, Marry, Kill\", without the second part of course. It was always so much better if they had experienced some of life's greatest pleasures before I finished with them. And I'll admit I enjoyed it a bit too. So I waited, while Sam wanted to go to the movies and eat pizza, until I could finally convince her to spend a night out at the motel.\n\nIt may have been worth it. Samantha was very happy, and I think she trusted me more after all that extra time. With that, and her shyness, there's no way she told anyone about our \"last night out\". \n\nI was still nervous. Samantha was shy, new in town, bad at making friends, and not on the greatest of terms with her family. But her checking her background had been annoying, and I was still certain I was missing something. Some old acquaintance, perhaps an ex-lover, she had that look in her eye sometimes, like when I catch the mirror thinking about Amanda.\n\nThe doorbell rang as I was getting dressed. I checked my phone to see an image of Samantha standing on my porch. \"The shit?\" I was *certain* I had told her I would pick her up. I pressed the intercom button. \"I'll be right there\"\n\nI opened the door and she dashed in. \"I thought I said I would pick you up?\"\n\nShe crossed her arms and looked at the floor. \"I know, I'm sorry. I just got so nervous, I thought I'd come here and wait.\"\n\nI sighed. She really did seem nervous. \"Alright, just let me finish getting dressed\" I thought about killing her right there, but I held back. I had waited this long, I wasn't going to waste all that extra effort.\n\n\"Thank you. I'll wait down here.\"\n\nI went back upstairs and turned my phone on so I could watch her. She seemed really uncomfortable being in my house. She would sit down one moment, then get up, move the chair, and sit down again. I wondered if she would be alright just ordering pizza and then going into the spare bedroom. The location wasn't that important, right? As long as it wasn't *my* bed, we could do it anywhere. \n\nI walked down the stairs. \"Hey, Sam,\" I called. \"Mind helping me with my tie?\"\n\nSamantha was pacing back and forth, but she stopped when she heard me. \"Oh, sure. I can do that.\"\n\nHer voice was trembling a little, and I could see her hands shake as she neatly straightened my tie. \"Are you alright dear?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, umm. Actually, could I have a little wine before we go.\"\n\n\"Sure, absolutely.\" I turned towards the kitchen. Wine, of course. Why had I never thought of alcohol before? It would make any woman so much easier.\n\nSamantha laughed. \"Thank you... Ears.\"\n\nI flinched. Something struck me in the back and I went down. I went for my knife, but she was faster. She grabbed my arms and pinned me down. She was FBI, I was going to jail. I had to get out.\n\nSam dug her knee into my spine and stuck a needle in my neck.\n\n\"You know the thing about killers, baby?\" she asked.\n\nI grunted, and she laughed again, nervousness gone. \"Killers are the easiest to make disappear, they do half the work for you.\"\n\nShe wasn't FBI. She wasn't a cop.\n\nShe stopped laughing. \"Now, where is your basement?\"\n\nI'm sorry, Amanda."], [2, "I usually know within minutes if it is the one. Not always of course, but once I know, it is little I can do about it.\n\nWe are talking. Exchanging pleasantries about who we are, sharing minor self-depreciating flaws in a humorous manner and competing in subverting the other one's flaws and explain how they are strengths. Travel. Future dreams. Common interest in horticulture.\nAnd there it is. The smile. Not any smile. The smile that tells me that all this is not just superficial banter to pass the time, but code for something deeper, and that she is probing the ground just as much as I am.\nI look into her eyes, my heart races, and it feels like I could drown. It's a little like falling in love, I guess. Maybe it is falling in love, I can never tell.\n\nI have been invited over for tea. I didn't expect things to go as fast, but I was nevertheless able to make necessary preparations. I would have preferred something entirely without taste, but there are only so many things you can prepare in a hurry.\nI comb my hair once more in the mirror by the hat rack, despite spending at least twice my usual time before the bathroom mirror. What is this? Me? Nervous?\n\nShe opens the door in a wonderful dress, and with a smile she accepts the suddenly so inadequate flower I offer her. With it delicately touching her upper lip, she shows me to the living room area of the small but cozily furnished appartment. On a tray on the low table by the large window is placed two mismatched teacups, and a tea cozy hints of a pot already prepared.\n\nAs we position ourselves on opposide sides of the table, she in an armchair on one side, me trying for a slightly nonchalant slouch in the sofa on the other, trying to mask the nervosity that does not seem to want to go away. As she pour the tea our code grows more transparent and we air deeper thoughts, and while she points out a particularly interesting book I make my move. A slight swiping motion over her teacup, and the kind of magic one uses to make coins disappear in one's hands is all that is needed.\n\nMy hand brushes against her's and I freeze like a deer in the headlights. She doesn't immediatey withdraw her hand. Neither do I. After an eternity we both withdraw, and as two sides of a single mirror we both take a sip of the tea.\nIt is bitter, but that's what you get if it steeps too long. I don't complain, it should mask the taste. I reach for two lumps of sugar from the sugar bowl. She has the slightest of frowns and does the same. I look at her. She looks at me. I see her. She sees me. I see her eyes. They are dilating slightly. My heart races. It feels like I could drown.\n\n~~~  \nno idea if good or bad, but I couldn't sleep once the idea had taken root"], [1, "[removed]"], [1, "Well, like the Soviet Union, one of us has to go down.

Also, what he didn't realize is that while we gathered info on each other, I also constructed a nuclear proof bunker. I've won you communist bastard. "], [1, "My stabbin'wagon was giving me trouble once again as the dark rusted insides howled and cranked while it backfired down the one way streets. I came to a stop light and used my time to spit on the windshield and wipe off the dust; my faded red 70's party van had seen better days. I reached behind me into the dark cab and felt around until I palmed a few 8-track tapes on the flooring. I was surprised that they hadn't fallen into the abyss of rust holes riddled throughout the hull. I looked up and the light had turned green, I popped in my favorite song.\n\n\nI hit the gas lightly and started cruising the sidewalks of the downtown market area. It was a college town and I always had my pick of young girls, but these days it was just for watching. I could hear my shopping music begin to fill the van as I trolled along patiently \"I'm a girl watcher, I'm a girl watcher, watching girls go by... My, my, my.\" the Okaysions really knew how to get me hard. Each girl jogging by wearing short running spandex, some smiling and shopping. Each one looked as visually tasty as I knew they would be held down in the back of my van.\n\n\nToday was different, and I knew this right off the bat because I had pulled right behind a new pearl blue minivan. This one's back window was covered in stick figure versions of each member of the family. I could see that there was a dog, a little boy, a daughter, and a mother. I wondered where daddy could be? This for me, was the only way to shop for victims. I knew exactly how many members of the family to expect when I followed them home. My confidence in this evening's events were making me excited. I was sure to slow down and ease up in my nonchalant chase.\n\n\nI followed the adorable family to a small suburb, they pulled into the perfect little split-level home complete with a white picket fence. Sure enough, mother and children bailed out of the car and went inside. I was breathing heavily as sweat dripped from my face to my undone pants. I didn't even realize my hand was already fumbling with my undercarriage. The thought of going home to use my metal tuning rod didn't hold a candle to what I planned on doing to this local family.\n\n\nI let my 8-track flip back to \"Deal Me In\" as the sun began to set behind me. When night finally fell I emerged from the van with my cordage and knife. The house was unlocked in the back, which was the greatest perk of living in this relaxed town. I let myself into their home, it smelled of cooked liver and onions. But to me, it smelled like the game. I dashed across the living room full of bullshit family photos and cheesy craft decor. Stopping for a listen I could only hear the breeze through the windows and a low contented snore from one of the bedrooms. Daddy is home children.\n\n\nSuddenly my head was pulled back at the neck and I struggled to even snort a breath. A sharp grinding wire was wrapped around my throat by someone who was very strong. \"You pathetic son of a bitch\" a voice said in a calm whisper, \"Do you really think I didn't notice you trailing us? My fucking family is here and you think you can get the best of me while they sleep!?\"\n\n\nAt this point I was turning blue, I struggled to put my fingers between my neck and the wire. I knew the voice behind me was the mother but for some reason I could not escape her grip. I had to reach for my knife and stab wildly, I had to make her whisper muffle into cries of pain.\n\n\n\"Uh uh uh, my silly boy. You aren't reaching for that knife! I'm tired of your shit. Come with me this way...\" she said as she began dragging me backwards. My knife was removed and tossed to the floor like a discarded newspaper. The lengthening hallway was getting darker and darker, my boots kicking about as I stumbled along with her tight grip. I heard a door open as I was pulled into a dimly lit room. I was tossed into a chair and quickly (expertly) tied down with more wire. The door closed in front of me while I was trying to focus on my surroundings. The room didn't smell like the game anymore, it smelled of piss and dry blood.\n\n\n\"So you're the girl watcher huh? I expected more but I guess a sweaty man in overalls that smells of unkempt taint and old diesel fuel should have been expected. You're disgusting, you're unprofessional, you don't deserve to be in my town anymore.\" she said as she circled me menacingly, then loomed closer. I refused to speak, I wasn't known for talking but this certainly was a surprising moment for me. I knew the rules; don't kill your own brothers and sisters. But how was I supposed to know? She took low profile to a whole new level.\n\n\n\"You're gonna be in here until the others arrive. You've been shitting where you eat long enough and it's time you are punished.\" She rose from my gaze and left the room, slamming the door behind her. Probably to go to sleep or check on her children, I'd expect she was just that calm about everything. I'd yell for help but what was my alibi? Who would hear me? All I could do was sit and wait until I got what was coming to me. Sit and wait while I thought over my mistakes and the sins that I don't regret."]], [[{"comment": "Seventeen people in 6 years- that's how many lives I've ended since I started all this. Whenever I see myself on the news, a part of me excites that doesn't normally exist. I feel the way I imagine a child does when it wakes up on Christmas day to a nice present; perhaps a more matured feeling, such as what flows through a mother does when her child graduates college. I guess that's all speculation, since I've known none of it myself. Now that I think about it, that's probably why I am the way I am.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, it's not enough. It's never enough; I am not satiated by the petty deaths of passing strangers who look at me the wrong way. I love the hunt, the thrill and the adrenaline, but it's the *content* that really matters. I want to pry the life from someone's body with force and feel like I've accomplished something.\n\nAnd so now is the cultivation of all my efforts and learnings- tonight is what my life has lead up to. I will no longer be afraid of him and take my frustrations out on worthless lives...I will kill my father, and take a scalpel to the prideful arrogance in his heart.\n\nHe, like me, was a serial killer. His body count was close to 200 by now, since he'd been doing it since I was a kid, and he was a true professional. No criminal investigators of any kind have even deemed him as a suspect since he started his work, if that gives you an idea of his skill. However, I know something no one else does: I know where he lives.\n\nIf you're wondering how, it's far more flagrant than interesting. I didn't track him down, he literally told me where to find him. Eight years ago, I was escaping the hellhole he called a household to be free and live a life outside of fear and pain. Before I even made it past the front gate, he'd somehow gotten in front of me.\n\n\"This is the address of where I stay before a hunt,\" he told me, shoving a slip of paper into my shirt pocket. \"If you aren't dead within a year, seek me. If you hate me so much, come to me with skill and determination. But let me warn you, child. If you come to this address, and you cannot end my life, I will end yours. You mean nothing to me.\"\n\nThat's my father, in all his greatness. Everyone else in my family had died years before, so it was just the two of us for most of my life. I tried to run from home so that I wouldn't end up like him, but I guess it was too late for me. I've killed innocent people to prepare myself for this night, but I know that somewhere, deep within my soul, I enjoyed it. That scares me more than the prospect of death.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNight fell upon the city, and I set out after packing my toolkit. *Tonight's going to be a long, long night.*\n\nI'd watched his little townhouse from a distance for the past year, and I know the rituals he holds as habit. Every Friday night, he goes into the house and checks on his inventory- I know he's also checking to make sure no one has been inside. Some nights, he decides to go hunting. Other nights, he simply heads home. Tonight, I saw him packing a small pouch with blades, lockpicks and tools to cover his tracks with.\n\n*He's found a victim. This is my chance.*\n\nBefore my father sets out on a hunt, he always meditates at this creepy altar in a closet with candles and incense lit on it. I can't fully make out what else is in that closet, but that doesn't matter- when he's meditating, he has no weapons on him. That's when I'll strike.\n\nSure enough, he sat by the wooden alter after lighting several candles and sticks of incense. When his hands raised above his heads and clapped together, I knew he was focused on his meditation, and I slipped in through the kitchen window with a long, sharp blade in my hands. I slithered up to him, pressing the coldness of steel against his neck. \n\n*This is it. This is the end.*\n\nVillainous laughter filled my ears, echoing through the small bedroom. He didn't try to fight back or disarm me, he just...laughed, and lifted his head up toward the closet. I followed his eyes and realized that the candle light was enough to see inside.\n\nKaren. Robbie. John. Grandma. Mom. Faces I hadn't seen since I was a child, yet memories of them became clear as day in my mind. Their heads were in jars of greenish liquid, bobbing ever so lightly. All were grimacing, as if aware of their fate. Their faces had been peeling slightly, the bits of skin floating near the lids.\n\nHis laughter grew louder as I reeled back in a horror few have known. My father stood up and turned to me, with an empty jar in his hand and a look of pure, murderous insanity on his face.\n\nThere was a small sticker on the jar that I somehow noticed, despite my fear. It had been written on.\n\n'*James*'.", "id": "czllaqc"}, {"comment": "You know what makes it even better? We were never really told if \"James\" was the father or the son.

But, I can endure all this; I can endure their emotions and their appreciation for one another, as long as they make no attempt to extend their perverse, caring appendages towards me. Leave me to my shadows; leave me to apricate within the dark that no one else can see. The light of kindness burns. I am, despite what people say, a most fragile individual. I can bend, I can twist with the blows and lacerations thrown by caring coevals, but I feel every twist, it sends cold frissons down my hunched spine. I kill. Have I mentioned that yet? No? Well now you know. Now you cannot plead ignorance in regard to the person to whom you're listening. Look how close we are. Look. I type, you read. I think, you understand. We are one, you and I, connected more than any other two individuals can be. \n\nMy licentiousness, the repugnancy of my thought, does not render the exterior world as being some hermetically sealed utopia into which I may never be granted access. Granted! How amusing that you should think that I would wish entry into your stygian city. I pass through on occasion, I have to, *I* still have to live. That can't be said for everyone, you know. But I can walk past a thousand people, each time I do I cringe, their presence cuts me, draws the air from my lungs into the surrounding atmosphere, where it encircles my body, dancing around, taunting my breathless attempts to inhale. Eventually my ambulation takes me past, and my breath, having finished its derision, returns to its resting place beside my heart. These people, they do not invoke within me the feelings that have made me famous. I am famous you know? My name is known by all, passed on only in whisper. *\"Don't give him what he desires\"* they say to one another, in cautious self-righteousness, as if *they* have anything *I* might want. How arrogant, would you not agree? To acquit them of their lives may be warranted, true, but it would be no work of art, no thing of beauty. And is not that the point of everything, beauty? It is for me.\n\nI said that I could pass by the faces that stumble through streets, from home to work, and work to home. They're hardly even faces; ideas, perhaps, a careless thought. But, the beautiful individual, I cannot simply pass *her* by. No, certainly not. She is not innocent. Well, no one is, are they reader? I am struck by beauty, not in the appreciative sense, but by a most motivating paroxysm, which induces in the langorous sinews of my pale body, an inimical intention. How can I let beauty exist; how can I let beauty haunt the world, taunt the world. You hate it don't you? They way it smiles, the way it laughs with a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders, and an inclination of the head such that the white teeth are revealed between the parted, pink swellings that sit beneath that infuriating, breathing, nose. And it always laughs, have you noticed that? Beauty never seems to suffer, at least, not without me. That is why I exist. Everyone, it is said, exists for a reason. Just as your purpose is to read what I write, and nothing more, my purpose is simple, rid the world, *my* world, of that  chancre of beauty. And so, whenever I see her, in all her different forms - perhaps today she wears blonde hair and a skin polished by the sun's careful caress, or maybe, she adorns herself in a brunette wig and caesious eyes, with a redolence that is oh so most appealing - it is my duty, my one purpose, to rid us, rid *you*, of this pestilential problem.\n\nThere was, I noted the other day, one individual in particular. Her hair possessed all the blackness of a sky that sits in dreary anticipation of the dawn, the sun not yet having revealed herself from her hiding place, and the moon lying, scratching, clawing at the horizon in hope that she would soon give way to light; but she doesn't. Her skin was pale, a white that seemed it would have had the capacity to inspire the blind with new-found vision. A labrose female was she, strolling in her high-heeled gait that inclined itself so perfectly in a straight line that would might suspect she were on rails - but who isn't? Oh beauty, do you never learn? Why do you keep walking before me like this, you know it will end the same way? I have returned your anthropomorphic appendages to you before, and I shall do so again with this one. I followed her, and before long she arrived at what as assuredly her home. I noted the address, colour of the door (black, who would have guessed?), and the shutters on the window that seemed a quasi-military in their strength. I suppose she too detests the light; every thorn has its rose I suppose.\n\nI returned that evening. Indeed, I'm here now. I can see a silhouette, a feminine adumbration through the slits of the window. The door is ajar. How naive, but they always are, aren't they reader? I pushed it and it crept open as if it knew the urgent nature of my silence. Within my left hand was sat, most calmly, my faithful friend; 7 inches in length, and glistening in a hushed way beneath the moon's weary gaze. The door on the left. Yes. She must be there. Her silhouette was. She had not moved, could not have moved. She was against the rear window. My foot steps were silent, my heart, as if in perfect harmony with the silence that my carefulness was singing, beat in a muffled caution. Step. Inhale. Step. Exhale. My breath must have been singeing her hair as she stared, unaware, into the distance. I could feel her, not with my hands, but by the mere observation of her proximity to death, I could feel it. Step. Step. Raise my blade. Raise my right hand. I lunged. Calculated. The blade sank into my victim. She did not scream. She did not flinch. She was not stabbed. She was not there. I withdrew my knife from the cushion, but I then heard the silence of a killer. I felt beauty's nauseating breath upon my shoulder, her sibulent exhalations were suffocating, but it was the entry of something sharp into the skin with which I had so delicately covered my bony back that truly stole my life from me.

But not for much longer.\n\nIt took hours, but I finally found her.  The woman of my dreams, the object of my desires.  I don't know who she is, but she'll know me in ways she can't even imagine.  As I follow her now, tracing behind in the shadows, waiting for her to lead me somewhere we begin, my heart races at the thought of that first incision.

I was just going to drug you so I could slice you open in your bed.  When you'd have the table installed?\"\n\n\"Just last month!

Shut up. Don't make me slit your throat.\n\nAs we rounded the corner into her neighborhood, Kate pressed her body close to mine and whispered by my ear, \"I'm going to do crazy things to you tonight.\" \n\nI smiled genuinely for the first time. \"Me too.\" Good lord. I love Tinderellas.\n\nFinally we reached her house; her 90 square feet coffin. Kate unlocked the door while gazing at me with lustful thirst. I leaned in to kiss those sweet lips one last time. Our hands roamed each other's bodies, her torso pushed against mine, and we kissed like young teenagers kissing for the first time. \n\nGasping for air, Kate grinned foxily and exhaled, \"Go on in.\" She eyed the door, signalling me to enter first.\n\nNo way I was doing that. I learnt this rule the hard way: never turn your back on your mark. It's too much exposure.\n\nInstead, I spun Kate around forcefully so her back was turned on me.

There was no mistaking it: I was Kate's prey, and her four walls were waiting to taste my blood.\n\nI stared at her. She was eyeing me with a look of shock and fury.\n\n\"What the fuck? You're a killer too?\" I said.\n\n\"What are you talking-\" Kate suddenly fell silent. \"Did you just say 'too'?\"\n\nI couldn't help it. I burst out laughing.\n\n\"Fuck, man. This is unreal.\"\n\nShe started to laugh as well, in a fashion quite similar to Kate, surprisingly.\n\n\"Well, I'm Mike.\" I approached her with an extended hand. \"Nice to meet you...\"\n\n\"Kelly.\" She shook my hand. \"I can't believe this.\" \n\n\"So, did you hire help for this?\" I said, pointing at the room.\n\n\"Nah. Did it myself. It's amazingly efficient.\" She paused and smiled coyly. \"I can show you just how efficient it is, if you'd like.\"\n\n\"Nice try.\"\n\n\"A girl has to try,\" she sighed. \"Anyway, how were you going to kill me?\"\n\nI smiled wryly and held up my stiletto proudly.\n\nKelly giggled, then held a hand to her mouth. \"Sorry, Mike. I just didn't expect such a... traditional tool.\"\n\n\"The hell did you just say?\" I snapped.\n\n\"No offense meant. Just surprised that you would use a knife when guns are so easy to get nowadays.\"\n\nPretentious bitch. *Knife*? This was a fucking custom-made stiletto. With 12 girls' blood on it.\n\n\"Did you know that there are many ways to kill with a 'knife'?\"\n\n\"Really?\" She rolled her eyes so slightly, she thought I wouldn't notice. What a joke. She may have been Kelly, but there was so much Kate in her as well. Too much.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, casually raising the stiletto to eye-level and keeping my eyes trained on her. She still stood there, leaning comfortably against the wall.\n\nThen I hurled the stiletto at that bitch.\n\nIt struck dead center in her forehead and she fell limp to the floor with a sound caught dead in her throat. As crimson blood began flowing out from the wound, she clawed at her neck in a desperate attempt to breathe. From the floor, she stared aghast, gasping for air, straining to say something. Even now, she still wanted to talk. Talk talk talk. Kelly, Kate, they talked too much. Finally, her body twitched. Then a calm swept across her and she rested. Just a pile of bones and skin now.

I turned around to see a lumbering old man, the kind of overweight that\u2019s not necessarily obese but more reminiscent of a landslide that got bottlenecked at the waist. With a great wheeze to his voice he asked, \u201cWhat size are your shoes young man.\u201d Pondering the various avenues to which this question originated from, without much thought I blurted, \u201cTwelve, sometimes eleven and a half depending on the brand.\u201d A noise that guttural doesn\u2019t quite fully describe almost flew out of his mouth, \u201cahh yea, that\u2019s what I thought. I\u2019m always right.\u201d\n\n\nNow the self-checkout line is simultaneously meditative and infuriating. A current dramatically shifting between shuffling feet, crinkled bags, a steady line of beeps and chatter. A trance into a simple mundanity, so harshly broken by the screech of a misplaced item in the bagging area. The kind of Sunday morning ritual that would eventually drive anybody crazy. Though of course my senses were heightened by the fact that two people were about to murder each other just a few feet to my left. And I knew it was going to happen, and so did they. I was simply a moderator to make sure no one chickened out.\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how it started. Well mostly it\u2019s unclear in the sense that there\u2019s no way I\u2019d write it down. But for better or for worse, I get a rise out of hiring hitmen to kill each other. Plotting carefully orchestrated situations to cause simultaneous death (meaning no payment required) and to create maximum spectacle. My dad always used to lecture me every day before school, \u201cnow son, a half-assed job isn\u2019t accomplishing anything at all.\u201d So I guess I will pinpoint that as the specific moment that jumpstarted this whole hobby. Because of course, as everyone recognizes, Freud was correct in all his assertions.\n\n\nYou know what always gets me though? It\u2019s the fucking jalapenos. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have the code memorized by now. I\u2019m always amazed at how the cashiers can remember all the produce codes when I can\u2019t even remember four digits. You gotta place them on the scanner/weight thing, and spend thirty seconds looking for it. And the goddamn jalapenos aren\u2019t even on the list. So you gotta call an attendant over, but it takes a minute to get their attention because everyone needs their ID checked at the same time buying their rack of Coors Light. And before they have a chance to enter the code in for you, there\u2019s two men\u2019s entrails splayed out all over the ground before you.\n\n\nSo yea, I blame my arrest on the jalapenos. I have this bad habit of coming across as a sociopath to people I meet. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s cause I\u2019m a sociopath, looking at the studies I really doubt it, but the police came and took a statement, and I must have said something wrong. I think it\u2019s cause I told them my jalapeno rant. I mean I confessed, I was too charged up, adrenaline makes you do crazy shit. And I was kinda excited to explain everything to them.

I really hated the thought of throwing them out, maybe I could find some way to restore them.\n\nI should have finished with Sam weeks ago. She was starting to make friends in town, friends would notice. But Jade had gotten me quite hooked on \"Fuck, Marry, Kill\", without the second part of course. It was always so much better if they had experienced some of life's greatest pleasures before I finished with them. And I'll admit I enjoyed it a bit too. So I waited, while Sam wanted to go to the movies and eat pizza, until I could finally convince her to spend a night out at the motel.\n\nIt may have been worth it. Samantha was very happy, and I think she trusted me more after all that extra time. With that, and her shyness, there's no way she told anyone about our \"last night out\". \n\nI was still nervous.

I had waited this long, I wasn't going to waste all that extra effort.\n\n\"Thank you. I'll wait down here.\"\n\nI went back upstairs and turned my phone on so I could watch her. She seemed really uncomfortable being in my house. She would sit down one moment, then get up, move the chair, and sit down again. I wondered if she would be alright just ordering pizza and then going into the spare bedroom. The location wasn't that important, right? As long as it wasn't *my* bed, we could do it anywhere. \n\nI walked down the stairs. \"Hey, Sam,\" I called. \"Mind helping me with my tie?\"\n\nSamantha was pacing back and forth, but she stopped when she heard me. \"Oh, sure. I can do that.\"\n\nHer voice was trembling a little, and I could see her hands shake as she neatly straightened my tie. \"Are you alright dear?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, umm. Actually, could I have a little wine before we go.\"\n\n\"Sure, absolutely.\" I turned towards the kitchen. Wine, of course. Why had I never thought of alcohol before?

I came to a stop light and used my time to spit on the windshield and wipe off the dust; my faded red 70's party van had seen better days. I reached behind me into the dark cab and felt around until I palmed a few 8-track tapes on the flooring. I was surprised that they hadn't fallen into the abyss of rust holes riddled throughout the hull. I looked up and the light had turned green, I popped in my favorite song.\n\n\nI hit the gas lightly and started cruising the sidewalks of the downtown market area. It was a college town and I always had my pick of young girls, but these days it was just for watching. I could hear my shopping music begin to fill the van as I trolled along patiently \"I'm a girl watcher, I'm a girl watcher, watching girls go by... My, my, my.\" the Okaysions really knew how to get me hard. Each girl jogging by wearing short running spandex, some smiling and shopping. Each one looked as visually tasty as I knew they would be held down in the back of my van.\n\n\nToday was different, and I knew this right off the bat because I had pulled right behind a new pearl blue minivan. This one's back window was covered in stick figure versions of each member of the family. I could see that there was a dog, a little boy, a daughter, and a mother. I wondered where daddy could be? This for me, was the only way to shop for victims. I knew exactly how many members of the family to expect when I followed them home. My confidence in this evening's events were making me excited. I was sure to slow down and ease up in my nonchalant chase.\n\n\nI followed the adorable family to a small suburb, they pulled into the perfect little split-level home complete with a white picket fence. Sure enough, mother and children bailed out of the car and went inside. I was breathing heavily as sweat dripped from my face to my undone pants. I didn't even realize my hand was already fumbling with my undercarriage. The thought of going home to use my metal tuning rod didn't hold a candle to what I planned on doing to this local family.\n\n\nI let my 8-track flip back to \"Deal Me In\" as the sun began to set behind me. When night finally fell I emerged from the van with my cordage and knife. The house was unlocked in the back, which was the greatest perk of living in this relaxed town. I let myself into their home, it smelled of cooked liver and onions. But to me, it smelled like the game. I dashed across the living room full of bullshit family photos and cheesy craft decor. Stopping for a listen I could only hear the breeze through the windows and a low contented snore from one of the bedrooms. Daddy is home children.\n\n\nSuddenly my head was pulled back at the neck and I struggled to even snort a breath. A sharp grinding wire was wrapped around my throat by someone who was very strong. \"You pathetic son of a bitch\" a voice said in a calm whisper, \"Do you really think I didn't notice you trailing us? My fucking family is here and you think you can get the best of me while they sleep!?\"\n\n\nAt this point I was turning blue, I struggled to put my fingers between my neck and the wire. I knew the voice behind me was the mother but for some reason I could not escape her grip. I had to reach for my knife and stab wildly, I had to make her whisper muffle into cries of pain.\n\n\n\"Uh uh uh, my silly boy. You aren't reaching for that knife! I'm tired of your shit. Come with me this way...\" she said as she began dragging me backwards. My knife was removed and tossed to the floor like a discarded newspaper. The lengthening hallway was getting darker and darker, my boots kicking about as I stumbled along with her tight grip. I heard a door open as I was pulled into a dimly lit room. I was tossed into a chair and quickly (expertly) tied down with more wire. The door closed in front of me while I was trying to focus on my surroundings. The room didn't smell like the game anymore, it smelled of piss and dry blood.\n\n\n\"So you're the girl watcher huh? I expected more but I guess a sweaty man in overalls that smells of unkempt taint and old diesel fuel should have been expected. You're disgusting, you're unprofessional, you don't deserve to be in my town anymore.\" she said as she circled me menacingly, then loomed closer. I refused to speak, I wasn't known for talking but this certainly was a surprising moment for me. I knew the rules; don't kill your own brothers and sisters. But how was I supposed to know? She took low profile to a whole new level.\n\n\n\"You're gonna be in here until the others arrive. You've been shitting where you eat long enough and it's time you are punished.\" She rose from my gaze and left the room, slamming the door behind her. Probably to go to sleep or check on her children, I'd expect she was just that calm about everything. I'd yell for help but what was my alibi? Who would hear me? All I could do was sit and wait until I got what was coming to me.

It was a cold feeling, but in all of our interrogations I would tell him where I lived back in El Paso. \n\nEvery time.\n\nI was never so sad to see other Americans as I was when those jeeps tore down the barbed wire castle Hugo built for us.\n", "id": "czeajbe"}], [{"comment": "I let my rifle rest and look up at my scout.\n\n\"He's non-threatening. Looks like a cook. We should try the chapel vantage. Bet we get a better shot,\" I say. Without waiting for Eddie's response, I begin unscrewing the mount so I can pack up my sniper. A few minutes of ammo boxing and we'd be ready to go.\n\n\"If you say so, guy,\" Eddie responds. He sidles up close to the crumbling edge of this seventh floor and looks down toward the encampment. Without glancing for it, he reaches into his pocket and retrieves a pair of binoculars\u2014dusty and used\u2014raising them slowly to his face, his eyes frozen on the space allowing us to see Emmerich. *Sweet, sweet Emmerich.*\n\n\"Don't look like much a cook to me, guy. I say you slow down your roll there, take a second gander, eh?\" Eddie never looks at me as he says this and his tone implies I may have missed something. I have to sell this and he's the one with his focused glare on Emmerich. I give it my best.\n\n\"You missed him dropping a heap of potatoes in a pot, Ed. It's done. We're switching vantage. Get packing,\" I say, attending my every intonation, policing my every pronunciation. *Potatoes? Oh, God, don't make me murder Emmerich.*\n\n\"I say, guy, I ain't seen\u2014\"\n\n\"*Ed*, you call me *guy* one more time and we'll see how much longer you scouting in the next four. Now, get your shit together and pull out. Got me?\" \n\nIf Eddie doesn't like my tone or deems my threat abusive, he fails to show it. Moving as smooth as a snake, he pockets his binoculars and gets packing up the rest of the gear. I soon sit up and pull out my smokes, gesturing Eddie to grab one. He does. We turn away from the encampment, slide into a mostly shuttered room on the opposite end of the dilapidated hotel, and light up.\n\nEddie's watching me. I don't like it. \n\n\"Look, guy, this ain't personal, but I just gave you an out and you fucked it up,\" Eddie says, taking a strong drag off his cigarette and sighing in exhalation.\n\nSteady, now: \"What do you mean, Ed?\"\n\n\"What I mean is: I saw you and that Jerry. What was it, 0500 this morning? How'd you even meet? I mean, how'd you even... *Cook, ha!*,\" Eddie shakes his head, continuing, \"Nevermind. I don't wanna know. But I ain't gonna sit by, guy. Tried to fix it for you. You're a good guy, in spite of, you know. Taking your flowery ass in,\" he says and reaches for his holster. Poor bastard may have seen me with Emmerich but he evidently has never seen me in combat. I have him on the ground quickly and disarm him. His smoke falls out of his mouth and he starts a laugh that is stymied by my elbow. Blood spurts out his nose.\n\n\"You fucking guy,\" he says, adding, \"*YOU FUCKING GUY!*\"\n\nI'm confused. I need a moment to calculate my next action, but there's so little in my disposal. Eddie has to die. *Emmerich, I will kill for you.* He has to. There's no other way.

He was a good guy, polite and well-mannered, and would always told you the truth. He was the biggest asshole in the entire Northwest.\n\nIt was about eight-o-forty-seven in the morning when I walked out in my usual jammies to check on the neighborhood. It was Sunday. Sunday was when fucking Jarrod, my left-door neighbor, would run around with his kid singing Disney songs. \n\nThe melody tore into my little ears like an axe splitting wood. It was not only the worse goddamned experience I've ever had in my life, it was the most heartwarming scene I've ever seen in the past two days. My heart filled with content.\n\nSo, when I saw Jeremy next door, teary-eyed and sobbing like a little bitch while he was hanging up a rope on the tree in the backyard, I knew exactly what I had to do.\n\n\"Hey, Wickerson!\" I called out to my fellow desk-buddy from high school. To be honest, I had no idea at all how I knew his name.\n\n\"My name's not Wickerson, it's Gary! You fucking asshole!\" he calls back, an aggravated sort of tone to his voice.\n\nOh wow. Gee. Where's all this negativity coming from? I'm trying to be a nice guy here with my coffee and Vault 111 jammies, and this guy's killing my vibe and everything.\n\nThat ain't right man. You don't kill a girl's vibe unless she follows you four miles home one day from school because you forgot your bag of tissues in the locker rooms. I mean, god Stacy. It's just tissues. That's fucking creepy. You've got issues.\n\nI poked my head over to see Jeremy/Gary pull over some steps and make a weird knot. He's bawling like a little bitch-boy the whole time.\n\nTalk about angst. What am I in? Some shitty melodramatic wish-fulfillment where some crazy, beautiful girl talks a guy out of killing himself? Nuh-uh honey. Good old Henrietta Lynette's might be hella crazy. But I'm a good six outta ten at the most.\n\nHe's making a noose it appeared, that Jeremy/Gary/Barry. He stared at me with his big blood-shot eyes as if he's expecting me to say something.\n\n\"Your parents home?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nah. They're away. Honeymoon. Took my little brother with them. Told me to stay inside and do my homework.\"\n\n\"Mhmm,\" I slurped at my sugary-sweet coffee, coated with two packs of sugars, heavy creamer, condensed milk, regular milk, whip cream, and ice.\n\nI checked my shoes and pulled up my phone to see my eyes.\n\nNope, I'm definitely not white and I do not have Uggs on. Goddamned shame.\n\nI shouted at him again, \"You know if we had any English homework over the break due for Mrs. Hinderson?\"\n\nI should really have just called Jackie about it. Don't know why I asked him. Maybe it's my soft side showing. Maybe I was  too lazy to pick up the phone and scroll over to contacts. Maybe hearing a grown man and a little girl singing \"Let it Go\" in the backyard's gave me brain damage.\n\nI did't care, I awaited his answer.\n\n\"Will you just leave me alone?! Screw you! You're an asshole! Go away!\"\n\n...\n\nWow. That's harsh man. I could feel the pain in his words. I didn't give a shit. He still sounded kinda whiny. Like Order of the Phoenix Harry, or Holden. Fuck those two.\n\n\"Hey, Jeremy!\" I called out to him.\n\n\"It's Gary!\" he sat his neck in the noose, standing on his tip toes over the stepstool.\n\nThis was it. My moment to be a hero.\n\nI braced myself mentally and emotionally. My coffee's getting cold. I can taste the diabetes tasting worse and worse.\n\n\"You're too low to snap your neck hanging! Might just wanna try slitting your hands in the bathtub! Drinking bleach maybe! If you're really hardcore, you can just stick your face in a lawnmower gas-tank and toss a match in it.\"\n\nHe stared at me, mortified.\n\nI sipped my coffee, the sound of \"People are Better than Reindeer\" fills my ears with the handsome single father's warm, honeylike voice, interrupted only by the screeching of his baby-girl.\n\nJeremy continued to stare dumbfounded. I walk back inside. I think my hot pockets were done, but they weren't. Son of a bitch microwave lied to me, it never even turned on.\n\nIt was unplugged the whole time.\n\nIf there's one thing I remembered that day, it was that Jeremy's first suicide attempt had successfully helped me to realize something important to myself.\n\nHot pockets are a load of shit. Fuck hot pockets. If I wanted a warm, meaty-cheese breakfast, I could just order a real fucking pizza. Why didn't I just order a pizza? I have a phone. I have money. It's forty degrees out. Hell yeah, I'd like some pizza.\n\nYou know what? Screw this story. Forget everything I just said. Pizza is the most important thing you'll ever get out of this.\n\nBecause even though stress can kill you, disappointment can shatter you, and depression can turn you inside-out and shake your mind, there's nothing like good old pizza to save your soul.\n\nUnless, you know, pizza's related to some traumatic event.\n\nThen just stick with hot pockets in that case."], [3, "Title: It Won't Be Long Now\n\n\"Hey Scott!\"\n\nScott dropped the rope he was hanging up.

Scott could see Mr. Frink wasn't buying it. \"All right they're just burst blood vessels.

Scott smiled politely then walked towards his backdoor when suddenly Mr. Frink said:\n\n\"Those people you left with yesterday,\" said Mr. Frink.\n\nScott stopped walking. He looked around again then threw his hands lazily in the air. \n\n\"Some classmates,\" said Scott. \n\n\"They weren't teenagers,\" said Mr. Frink. \n\nScott walked slowly up to Mr. Frink. His red eyes were even more disturbing up close. \n\n\"I'm gonna have to ask you to stop asking so many questions Mr. Frink.\"\n\nThen Mr. Frink stopped his charade. He rolled up the newspaper he was holding. He smiled and took off his glasses.

He looked down, then threw the rope across his yard as far as he could. \n\n\"WHAT THE HELL,\" shouted Scott. \n\nThe rope had become a hissing snake. He breathed fast. Then he felt the hands of Mr. Frink gripping his shirt. He stared into his eyes. \n\nMr. Frink's eyes were red like blood.

Now get out of here so I can swing alone.\"\n\nThis kid, Jack Mulligey. If I could say three things about him, they'd all be screwed one way or another. The worst part is, when you think of this Mulligey boy, your thoughts go to his abusive mother. His older twin bothers, the ones who push him around. Not the brotherly way, I mean they knock him to the floor, with kicks and saliva falling shortly after. You can take one look at this Mulligey kid, and you'll know it. By the way his dark skin cracks at the corner of his lips, or bloodied fingernails that sit at the peak of long, slender fingers, or the gaps between his bottom teeth, not because they haven't grown in yet, but because he's lost both the baby pair and the adult pair from some tussle with a violent stranger.

No, he wasn't sad. He was angry. I've seen it before. \"Now get lost.\"\n\n\"Jack.\"\n\n\"Roy, get outta here!\" He dropped the rope from his dark hands and ran towards me, jumping over a smalled pile of raked leaves piled neatly on the dry grass and tackling me. I held his wrists, lightly, allowing him to get a few punches into my chest. He needed it. I wanted this for him, more so than a knotted rope. But his punches were pure. He was a soft fifteen year old, and here I was in my mid-twenties allowing this teen kid to pound my chest like some primal beast. Had any of our neighbors heard the rustling in the leaves or the cursing from Mulligey's lips, they would have thought to call the cops and break it up. But it was mid-day on a warm Sunday. The neighbors were all at church. Mulligey's twin brothers weren't home. His mother, I could only guess. He picked a good time to knot that rope. It probably would have been better had I not skipped church. \n\nHis pounding stopped. He fell off to the side and laid on his back, tears rolling backwards down his cheeks and neck. The collar on my shirt was stretched, torn. There was spots of spit marking my chest. \n\nI laid there next to him. He didn't say a word for some time, but he was there and he was quiet. \n\n\"Jack?\"\n\n\"What is it, Roy?\"\n\n\"Where'd you get that rope?\"\n\n\"My momma gave it to me. Why do you care?\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\n\"She said a lot and gave me the rope.\"\n\nI closed my eyes and sighed. \n\n\"Do you know I skipped church today, Jack?\"\n\n\"You never skip church, Roy.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nThere was silence. We heard a few cars drive down past our street. The neighbors were returning from mass. And we stayed there on the green grass, laying in crispy leaves of brown and yellow. The stains on my shirt were fading. \n\n\"Hey, Jack?\"\n\n\"Mhm?\"\n\n\"Can I have that rope you knotted?\"\n\n\"That's my rope, Roy. My momma gave it to me.\" \n\n\"I know, but I think I want it.\"\n\n\"You just don't want me to hurt myself.\"\n\n\"Would you want me to hurt myself?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want that, Roy.\" He paused. I knew what he was thinking. \"That's not right.\"\n\n \"Jack.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Do you still want me gone? I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"No. But I'm hungry, too. Is church over?\"\n\nWe had been laying in the grass for an hour. \"Yeah, Jack, church is over. It always ends at this time, don't you know? You want some lunch? I'll make you some.\"\n\n\"Let's go eat some lunch.\"\n\n\"Head on inside and wash up. I'm gonna lay here a bit longer. It's nice today.\"\n\nHe rolled onto his side and sprung up quickly, then ran onto his porch and through the back door. When he was gone, I sat up and saw the rope twisted into a pile on the ground. The other half hung over the tree lazily on a low, weak branch. I got up, dusted my backside and grabbed it. It was thick. I pulled the knot and it came loose immediately. \n\nHe came running down his porch. I smiled. "], [1, "\"You don't have to do this.\"\n\nGod damn that sounds so cheap. He knows he doesn't have to do it, but he wants to. If he was about to eat a burger and I said, \"You don't have to do this,\" the motherfucker would have still bit into that burger. So now, standing in the freezing, crisp December air, I have to think of something better to say to my boyfriend.\n\n\"I wanted to kill myself too, you know this. We've all had it rough. Just please step down from that ladder baby.\" \n\nHe just kept tying that noose. Carefully, methodically. \n\nI've known him for years. We've lived next to each other for years.

We had a hard time facing each other in middle school, but after all the awkwardness subsided we accepted our feelings in freshman year of high school.\n\n\"Baby I'm sorry! I know what you're feeling, I really do! That's why I just want to talk to you! PLEASE come down!\"\n\nWe had been through four homecomings, two proms, and a graduation. His love for me never wavered in those years. Even when his dad never came back from vacation. Or when he lost his mom to a Sunday drive to church. He still loved me. His goofy smile never dimmed. His eyes betrayed the demons inside. \n\nUntil this moment.\n\nAt this moment he was holding the key to letting his demons out, and with one final tug of the noose, he was ready to turn the lock. \n\n\"PLEASE! NO!\"\n\nThe tears stung my eyes.\n\nAs he grabbed the noose and pulled it towards him, I could think of only one thing to do. \n\nI kicked the ladder. \n\nIt swayed two or three times before he finally slipped off the top rung and landed silently in the snow in front of me. \n\nI started to mutter a lame apology when I noticed the pristine white around him turning a dark crimson. The rich color ate everything in its path before pooling around my boots. I shook and sobbed, and feared what I would see if I turned my boyfriend over. \n\nTurns out I didn't have to. His body-temp blood melted away the snow around him and shifted his body sideways. The once bright eyes and goofy smile were now caved in from the rock that sat beside them. \n\n\"You don't have to do this,\" I said.\n\nI picked up the ladder.\n\n\"You don't have to do this.\"\n\nI climbed to the top.\n\n\"You don't have to do this.\"\n\nI didn't have to, but I sure as hell wanted to. \n\nI took the noose in my hands, and turned the lock. "]], [[{"comment": "Jeremy Wickerson was a particular annoying son of a bitch from Montana. He was a good guy, polite and well-mannered, and would always told you the truth. He was the biggest asshole in the entire Northwest.\n\nIt was about eight-o-forty-seven in the morning when I walked out in my usual jammies to check on the neighborhood. It was Sunday. Sunday was when fucking Jarrod, my left-door neighbor, would run around with his kid singing Disney songs. \n\nThe melody tore into my little ears like an axe splitting wood. It was not only the worse goddamned experience I've ever had in my life, it was the most heartwarming scene I've ever seen in the past two days. My heart filled with content.\n\nSo, when I saw Jeremy next door, teary-eyed and sobbing like a little bitch while he was hanging up a rope on the tree in the backyard, I knew exactly what I had to do.\n\n\"Hey, Wickerson!\" I called out to my fellow desk-buddy from high school. To be honest, I had no idea at all how I knew his name.\n\n\"My name's not Wickerson, it's Gary! You fucking asshole!\" he calls back, an aggravated sort of tone to his voice.\n\nOh wow. Gee. Where's all this negativity coming from? I'm trying to be a nice guy here with my coffee and Vault 111 jammies, and this guy's killing my vibe and everything.\n\nThat ain't right man. You don't kill a girl's vibe unless she follows you four miles home one day from school because you forgot your bag of tissues in the locker rooms. I mean, god Stacy. It's just tissues. That's fucking creepy. You've got issues.\n\nI poked my head over to see Jeremy/Gary pull over some steps and make a weird knot. He's bawling like a little bitch-boy the whole time.\n\nTalk about angst. What am I in? Some shitty melodramatic wish-fulfillment where some crazy, beautiful girl talks a guy out of killing himself? Nuh-uh honey. Good old Henrietta Lynette's might be hella crazy. But I'm a good six outta ten at the most.\n\nHe's making a noose it appeared, that Jeremy/Gary/Barry. He stared at me with his big blood-shot eyes as if he's expecting me to say something.\n\n\"Your parents home?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nah. They're away. Honeymoon. Took my little brother with them. Told me to stay inside and do my homework.\"\n\n\"Mhmm,\" I slurped at my sugary-sweet coffee, coated with two packs of sugars, heavy creamer, condensed milk, regular milk, whip cream, and ice.\n\nI checked my shoes and pulled up my phone to see my eyes.\n\nNope, I'm definitely not white and I do not have Uggs on. Goddamned shame.\n\nI shouted at him again, \"You know if we had any English homework over the break due for Mrs. Hinderson?\"\n\nI should really have just called Jackie about it. Don't know why I asked him. Maybe it's my soft side showing. Maybe I was  too lazy to pick up the phone and scroll over to contacts. Maybe hearing a grown man and a little girl singing \"Let it Go\" in the backyard's gave me brain damage.\n\nI did't care, I awaited his answer.\n\n\"Will you just leave me alone?! Screw you! You're an asshole! Go away!\"\n\n...\n\nWow. That's harsh man. I could feel the pain in his words. I didn't give a shit. He still sounded kinda whiny. Like Order of the Phoenix Harry, or Holden. Fuck those two.\n\n\"Hey, Jeremy!\" I called out to him.\n\n\"It's Gary!\" he sat his neck in the noose, standing on his tip toes over the stepstool.\n\nThis was it. My moment to be a hero.\n\nI braced myself mentally and emotionally. My coffee's getting cold. I can taste the diabetes tasting worse and worse.\n\n\"You're too low to snap your neck hanging! Might just wanna try slitting your hands in the bathtub! Drinking bleach maybe! If you're really hardcore, you can just stick your face in a lawnmower gas-tank and toss a match in it.\"\n\nHe stared at me, mortified.\n\nI sipped my coffee, the sound of \"People are Better than Reindeer\" fills my ears with the handsome single father's warm, honeylike voice, interrupted only by the screeching of his baby-girl.\n\nJeremy continued to stare dumbfounded. I walk back inside. I think my hot pockets were done, but they weren't. Son of a bitch microwave lied to me, it never even turned on.\n\nIt was unplugged the whole time.\n\nIf there's one thing I remembered that day, it was that Jeremy's first suicide attempt had successfully helped me to realize something important to myself.\n\nHot pockets are a load of shit. Fuck hot pockets. If I wanted a warm, meaty-cheese breakfast, I could just order a real fucking pizza. Why didn't I just order a pizza? I have a phone. I have money. It's forty degrees out. Hell yeah, I'd like some pizza.\n\nYou know what? Screw this story. Forget everything I just said. Pizza is the most important thing you'll ever get out of this.\n\nBecause even though stress can kill you, disappointment can shatter you, and depression can turn you inside-out and shake your mind, there's nothing like good old pizza to save your soul.\n\nUnless, you know, pizza's related to some traumatic event.\n\nThen just stick with hot pockets in that case.", "id": "cyk1wrw"}, {"comment": "Not sure how to feel about this, not sure if I'm supposed to.", "id": "cyk2pc3"}, {"comment": "Just roll with it.

Especially the heel slice that faces the wall. Especially when you've been with the same loaf your entire life.\n\nMy loaf had been raised in Aisle 2, just like all the other loaves. We were at the back of the shelf, but the other slices never seemed to notice. They were always boasting about how fluffy their insides were and smoothly cut they were on each side, completely oblivious to how deep on the shelf we had been stuffed. The middle slices passed away the days by talking shit to the wheat bread and saying things to the marbled rye that, honestly, I found unsettling and racist. \n\nBut I never said anything. They were middle slices. Of course they thought they were the best. I mean, they were the best. I knew that was true, because they always told me. Or at least, they told the slice next to me. Nobody talks to the heel slice. Especially the heel slice that faces the wall.\n\nOne day, we were picked up by a man with a thin mustache and greasy hair. I didn't like the look of him, but he tossed us in his cart anyway. The middle slices roared in triumph. They were right, of course. They usually were. Being picked out is a great honor. The middle slices hurled a few final slurs at the marble rye and said something I can't repeat to the gluten-free bread as we were wheeled away from Aisle 2. I, of course, was pressed against the back of the cart. And the back of the trunk. And, when we got to Greasy Man's apartment, the back of the cupboard. That's how things always are for a heel slice that faces the wall.\n\nAs the days passed, Greasy Man began to make sandwiches. The cupboard would creak open, and the middle slices crowed. Greasy Man would flip through a few, like a student sorting index cards, before picking a pair of robust slices that would howl in triumph. It was a great honor, of course, to be picked. It also meant they would be eaten and brutally killed, but the middle slices lived for that. There was no honor in bread that lived a long life. There was only honor in death.\n\nI, of course, was not meant for such honor. I had learned that long ago. When our loaf first found a place on the shelf of Aisle 2, I had asked one of the middle slices if we could be on a sandwich together one day. The entire loaf laughed at me for a week. The other loaves heard about it and laughed at me too. Even the bagels caught wind of how stupid I was, and those idiots had holes in their heads. The entire assortment of grain products laughed and screamed and the middle slice who I had asked the question to, because I had foolishly thought he was a decent guy with an open mind, said the only place I would ever go is the bottom of a trash can, where I would be pressed against the back of a terrible black bag, much worse than the nice yellow one I got to live in now. I would sit in that black bag and and slowly rot away. There would be no honor for me. There is no honor in being a heel slice. Especially a heel slice that faces the wall.\n\nGreasy Man chose one middle slice after another. Even the other heel was pulled out to be part of a bread pudding (I never really talked to that heel slice, since he lived so far away, but from what I had heard life was a little bit easier for a heel slice that faced the open air). Finally, there were only two slices: myself, and the middle slice who had ridiculed me so long ago.\n\nThe other slice never talked to me. Sometimes when the cupboard creaked open, only to have Greasy Man retrieve one of the bean cans or a cowardly banana, the middle slice would grumble that he would never get to be on a sandwich because of \"that lousy fucking heel in the back.\" I think he knew I could hear him. And perhaps he was right. Deep down, I wanted him to be right. I knew we would be thrown away soon. Maybe, just maybe, that middle slice would have to sit in the garbage with me. And maybe, just maybe, when I was turning to dust, I could get a little bit of pleasure from knowing that the cruelest slice of bread I had ever known was turning to dust in the same exact way.\n\nThe day came where I could hear voices outside the cupboard. I noticed the voices because usually, there weren't any. Greasy Man was not one to have visitors. But, as he opened up the cupboard, today I could hear his words clearly echoing against the wood: \"I need to throw this bread away, it's going to mold soon.\"\n\nI braced myself. The middle slice trembled. And then, for the first time since Greasy Man had taken us in, I heard a woman's voice.\n\n\"Oh, before you do, could I grab one? A slice of bread with just a little butter would taste really good right now.\"\n\nMy heart sank. The middle slice roared as Greasy Man reached for him.\n\n\"Oh, actually, can I have the heel?\"\n\n\"You want the heel?\"\n\n\"Yeah, my parents always made me eat the heels, it's kind of a thing for me.\"\n\n\"Sure, whatever.\"\n\nTime stopped.\n\nFor a split second, as Greasy Man's fingers pressed against me, I swear the world was enveloped in silence. Silence broken by the middle slice screaming, first in disbelief, then in anger. \"You can't take HIM! He's a fucking HEEL SLICE! He faces the WALL! What the FUCKING SHIT!?\"\n\nBut the screams faded away as I soared away from the bag, up through the sky. Light ripped into my vision and I became dizzy, so dizzy that I almost missed being handed off to a girl. She had pale skin and green eyes and red hair with a streak of purple shooting down the side. The way the light bounced off her many colors dazzled me. She was beautiful. She was perfect. She made every wall I had ever stared at seem meaningless and stupid and pedestrian. She was everything that a black bag isn't. \n\nAnd she was going to eat me. This beautiful, amazing, perfect creature was going to eat me, leading to painful, violent, and sudden death.\n\nThe kind of painful, violent and sudden deaths rarely experienced by heel slices. Especially a heel slice that faces the wall."], [2, "She bought me at the store 5 days ago.  I remember the way she grabbed my bag, the words she said as she placed me into the cart next to the loaf of thin-sliced white. \n\n\"In case I feel like *actually* trying to lose weight this week,\" she said to me.  She doesn't need it though, the weightloss, I mean. She's perfect the way she is.  She has Italian loaf skin and rye crust hair, and eyes that remind me of cinnamon raisin.  She sings when she slices lettuce and tomatoes, this lovely melody that reminds me of the baker the day I came out of of the oven.  She makes me feel freshly baked.\n\nBut, sadly, the whole grain loaf I'm cursed to be in will never be the apple of her eye.  Any time she reaches onto the counter to make a sandwich, or a melt, or garlic toast..I know she'll go for the white bread.  But..maybe today will be different.  I caught her looking at my loaf yesterday...she actually stopped and looked.. at *my* loaf... at *me.*  \n\nToday might be my day.  According to the spices, every Tuesday she makes herself a turkey sandwich, just two pieces of bread and the usual fixings.  But as my hopes go up, I'm reminded of the other thing the spices said: she always buys whole grain, but has never once actually *chosen* it.  But, I'm not crazy...am I?  She *did* look at me.  She did, didn't she?  \n\nMy self doubt is confirmed as I watch her walk into the kitchen.  If I had blood it would be rushing as I watch her reach into the refrigerator for all the ingredients, then reach into the silverware drawer for the butter knife.  I've never been so nervous.  The end slice tells me to calm down but I can barely register the words as she approaches us.  My crust wants to scream in a mixture of panic and anticipation.\n\nThen, all at once, I watch in horror, my hopes shatter into a million pieces, as she grabs the loaf of white bread.  I can't bear the sight of watching her assemble her sandwich using the *white bread.* But as much as it hurts...I'm too torn to look away.  Defeated...broken...like I had been left out all day and was snapped in half on the way to the trash can.  Yeah...exactly like that.  \n\nShe walks out of the room.  I can hear the clock ticking: tick..tock..tick..tock.  Each second feels like another soul-crushing hour of rejection.  Just seconds later though, I hear her speak from the living room.  I can barely hear it from where I'm at, but I do hear her speak.  \n\n\"You know what?  Screw this...I need to make a change.\"  She sounds annoyed, bitter.  \n\nI see her enter the kitchen again, discarding the sandwich she had already made into the trashcan as she approaches me fast.  I barely have time for everything I'm feeling to completely reverse as she reaches for the bag my loaf is in.  *My* loaf.  The bag *I'm* in.  \n\nAll the excitement is coursing through me again, surging through me as her hand reaches in and grabs the slice ahead of me and, more importantly, *me*.  I can't even describe the feeling as she lays me down on the paper plate.  I feel like heaven itself is stroking me as she gracefully spreads Miracle Whip onto me with her butter knife.  I've never felt joy as immense as the joy I feel as she lays the turkey on top of me and flips me over, completing a sandwich with *me.*\n\nI can't imagine the possibility of feeling better, but I know I will soon.\n\nSoon, she will sit with her legs crossed on the sofa, her favorite blanket over just her lap.  Soon, she will turn on the television and find something to watch.  And soon, she will lift me off of the plate and take her first bite.  And though with each bite she will take more and more out of me, every time her teeth go through my body, I will feel more complete."]], [[{"comment": "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "d5ezrpq"}], [{"comment": "It's not easy, you know, being the heel slice.

The pink one!\"\n\nWell, I do love blue, so more for me. I pressed another quarter into her pudgy toddler fingers, waiting until they clasped shut before taking a step back.\n\n\"Go, Asty, go, go Asty, go!\" My hands clapped in a waltzing beat as she turned the machine wheel with both hands. The clicks grew closer together, then a ping and clunk. My hands pressed together, hoping that my baby would have her wish granted like Dragonball Z.\n\nThe plastic gem was green but by the widening of her eyes I think she likes it more than the two blues in my hands.\n\n\"Mom, it's done!\" One of my boys called, can't tell which without seeing whose mouth was moving or what shirt the speaking one wore.\n\n\"Okay, Max!\" I called back.\n\n\"It's Lex, we switched shirts!\"\n\nI wasn't checking which shirt, but that's good info to know should it come time to the twins proper. Yet when my eyes locked on them, I noticed the minute differences between them. The white shirt was sullied with a soda spill, Max. The neat, hands behind his back, and waiting for orders, Lex. Both have blond hair and green eyes, and they seem to blink at me at the same time.\n\nI reached my hand down for the baby of the group, and she reached up with her sticky toddler hands.\n\n\"Green...\"\n\n\"Yes, green-\" I would've added 'It goes well with pink.' but I didn't want to remind her of her failed conquest and beg for more quarters. I rolled the two blue 'jewels' in my palms before tucking it into my pocket; They're mine and no one's going to deny me that.\n\nMax sat on one of the many washers, hopping off and followed me to the dryers. Folding laundry was a quiet task, sleeve, sleeve, half, half then drop into a basket. Then there was a yap-yap at the door. Honestly, who'd bring a dog to a dingy laundromat?\n\n\"Pepper! Calm down Pepper!\" The nappy woman slapped the tiny tan pooch on the back but it kept on yapping, snarling in a low growl too.\n\nI hoisted Asty on the shelf where we're folding laundry; The rules of 'no sitting on the tables' doesn't matter as much when there's a yapper running loose.\n\n\"You wanna fold a shirt?\" I smiled, handing her one of her pink shirts.\n\n\"Mom.\"\n\n\"There you go! Nice and neat!\"\n\n\"Mom?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" I turned to- White shirt, Max.\n\n\"Can I have a soda?\" He pointed to the vending machine.\n\nI gave my answer though my actions, digging into my pocket and pulling out three quarters. His thanks was a nod and a brisk walk away.\n\n\"He's slacking off again.\" Lex sighed, folding one of Dad's underwear's.\n\nFor all the intelligence Lex seemed to have, he forgets that his brother doesn't plan that far. He was on his way back to join the folding team when that yapper- His harrowing wails-\n\nThe world swooshed by me as I swooped my second oldest son under my arm. Pain snapped though my thin stocking and it threw me into a Belmont spree, with my belt. The buckle was undone in a single motion and it snapped on the gray tiles, until it whapped the yapper on the nose.\n\nThe owner screeched as her precious little puppy yiped like a frog zapped by an electric fence, bolting, fleeing from my charging pursuit. I had half the nerve to whip the owner too for scooping and protecting my prey in her scrawny arms.\n\n\"Keep that thing away from my babies!\" I pointed, pulling my finger away when the mutt snapped, braver in it's owner's arms.\n\n\"And you keep that boy away!\" She retorted, jabbing my son's back.\n\nWap! I went Boondocks with the belt, cracking it on her hallowed cheek. As her body twirled and crashed into the dryers in seeming slow motion, I regretted my decision.\n\n\n----\n\nGrats!

I retrieved them from the mad lord's armory, after destroying his phylactery.  I recognized them for what they were.  They are currently stored in the trunk at the foot of the bed,\"     \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attempted to rise from the bed to retrieve them, only to be held back by a gentle hand.  Literally.

You're in no condition to bear them.\"     \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded in response, and at the same time, there was a brisk knock on the door.

He wore a fitted black suit with a tie so firmly roped that it seemed to be choking him. A smile crept across his face that reminded Jamie of a slowly turned flip-book. \"Hello, young man. My name is Al Gore. Do you like things?\""], [224, "*Knock, knock, knock.*\n\nEach bang on the door progressively became louder. Mason was sitting quietly in his living room only feet away, mindlessly flipping through television stations. Infomercials, reruns, and talk shows flashed across the screen, only for him to stop on Good Morning America. The knocks startled him and his head snapped towards the door. The brief moment of panic settled and he stood up, muttering to himself as he went to look through the peephole. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 7:30. Can\u2019t you Jehovah\u2019s wait until I leave for work\u2026\u201d\n\nTwo well-dressed men stood at his door, both nearly identical in appearance; tinted aviators, a charcoal suit and tie, and a brass tie bar which held their silky accessory in place. \n\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Mason asked the two as he cracked the door, trying his best to sound polite through his groggy voice. \n\n\u201cMister McCormick, this is First Lieutenant Figueroa, and I\u2019m Captain Underwood. We\u2019re with the United States Air Force Security Forces. Would you mind stepping outside for a moment?\u201d \n\nMason had opened the door completely at this point, placing himself between the airmen and his living room. Captain Underwood had removed a wallet-sized badge from his jacket pocket and offered it to Mason as he stepped outside and closed the door behind him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d Mason asked, seeming a bit less polite than before. He grabbed the badge hastily and opened it, looking it over curiously. \n\nFigueroa piped up, \u201cWe\u2019ve been ordered to bring you in for questioning. Please come with us.\u201d he said, turning sideways and motioning towards the nondescript white Chevrolet that was parked in front of the home. \n\n\u201cQuestioning for what? I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d Mason replied, tilting his head a bit as he slipped the badge back into Underwood\u2019s palm. \u201cDo you have a warran- do you even have the authority to do that?\u201d he asked loudly, backing up a bit towards the door. \n\nUnderwood sighed and slowly pulled the left-side of his suit jacket back, revealing a holstered handgun. He rested his hand on the grip and fixed his eyes on Mason.\n\n\u201cMister McCormick, you need to come with us. You can walk yourself to the car or we can bring you there ourselves.\u201d the Captain insisted, stepping back a bit to give Mason room to comply.\n\nAnd he did. \n\nMason swore up and down underneath his breath as he walked towards the car with Figueroa in tow. Confused, angry, and tired, Mason wasn\u2019t sure what he had gotten himself into. The door slammed quickly as he was placed in the backseat, Underwood taking the helm and Figueroa riding shotgun. The car began moving as a quick exchange went out via radio between the First Lieutenant and a staticy female voice:\n\n>\u201cThis is First Lieutenant Figueroa, Spaceman has been secured.\u201d\n>\n>\u201c[Inaudible] ...unharmed?\u201d\n>\n>\u201cAffirmative.\u201d\n\nMason fidgeted with his fingers as he stared out of the car\u2019s window, both of the suits remaining completely silent. They passed over the Spokane River and Latah Creek before Mason finally spoke. \n\n\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d he asked, leaning forward in his seat, head almost parallel to the two in front of him.\n\n\u201cSit back.\u201d Figueroa said quickly.\n\nAssisted by a harsh shove from the Captain, Mason rested against the backseat, eyes focused on the ceiling of the car. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening. This can\u2019t. What did I even do wrong?\u201d he thought to himself, sighing heavily. The reality of the situation starting to set in.\n\nThirty minutes passed before the car began to slow to a crawl, the trio passing through a gate with two armed guardsmen on each side. Mason glanced out of the window at the sign near their booths: *Fairchild Air Force Base* it read, the emblem matching the one on Captain Underwood\u2019s badge.\n\nThe car moved quickly through the base afterwards, passing a grounded pair of tanker planes before coming to a complete halt inside of a dark, nearly-empty hangar. The door of the hangar began to slowly descend, the two suits refusing to exit the vehicle until it was closed entirely. \n\n\u201cGet out.\u201d Figueroa said, pulling the backdoor open. \u201cQuickly now.\u201d he insisted, watching Mason step out onto the concrete ground. \n\n\u201cGeneral Jamerson.\u201d Underwood said loudly, closing his door and offering a salute to the man in blue who had begun to approach them. \n\n\u201cCaptain Underwood.\u201d the figure said, returning the salute briefly before his attention turned to Mason. He stared for a moment before a grin crossed his face, turning on his heel. \u201cGood. Get him to the table.\u201d he said, starting back towards the center of the hangar. \n\nFigueroa quickly grabbed Mason\u2019s arm and shoulder, and Mason quickly yelped at the sudden forcefulness. \n\n \u201cGet the fuck off of me!\u201d he yelled, writhing and trying to escape the First Lieutenant\u2019s grip, but to no avail. He was pulled towards the center of the structure and tossed hastily into a folding chair in front of a plastic table. Figueroa and Underwood exchanged nods and fixed their eyes on Mason, hands resting on the grips of their weapons. \n\n\u201cMister McCormick\u2026\u201d General Jamerson said, thumbing through a manila folder that rested on the table. \u201cHave you ever heard of a game called *No Man\u2019s Sky*?\u201d he asked, placing his fingers together as he looks up at Mason with a grin.\n\n\u201cYe- why does that matter? Why am I here?!\u201d Mason said quickly, irritated by the General\u2019s seemingly irrelevant question. Sweat started to slowly drip down his face and he felt his stomach begin to turn. This was really happening.\n\nGeneral Jamerson looked between the Captain and First Lieutenant, then back to Mason. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been selected for an incredibly important national security initiative, Mister McCormick. You\u2019ve shown that you have just the sort of can-do attitude that\u2019s needed for this program. We can offer you unmatched benefits and an excellent salary, and all you need to do is spend some time abroad.\u201d Jamerson said, closing the manila folder and sliding it back towards himself. A red *TOP SECRET; CLASSIFIED MATERIAL* header was visible.\n\nMason\u2019s face twisted as he settled back in the chair, realizing he would be unable to flee no matter how hard he tried. His face turned pale and his heart pounded faster than normal.\n\n\u201cWhy me? What could I possibly do for you?\u201d he asked slowly, arms falling to his side.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, if we could have gotten better, we would have. But you, Mason, you\u2019re the best we\u2019ve got. We even had Secretary Mabus discuss this with Scott Kelly, but he wasn\u2019t able to make it through training.\u201d Jamerson said, standing up from his seat and slowly moving to the other side of the table.\n\n\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d he asked, placing his hand on Mason\u2019s shoulder in an attempt to comfort the captive.\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Mason replied, looking Jamerson\u2019s face over. \u201cYou have to have the wrong guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you, of all people, make it to 46 hours in *No Man\u2019s Sky*? I tried it. These two tried it\u2026\u201d he motioned to Figueroa and Underwood. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our best pilots try it. The Navy had their best submariners and aviators try it. Two of them went completely mad at 20 hours.\u201d the General sighed and paused for a moment, taking a deep breath. His grip tightened.\n\n\u201cSo tell me, Mason, how did you do it?\u201d\n\nMason quirked a brow at the General, looking between both of the suits that had taken him from his home and then back to Jamerson. He opened his mouth briefly before slamming it shut, still trying to process everything that\u2019s happened so far. The sweating stopped for the most part and the stomach pain had nearly subsided. \n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d he fixed his eyes on General Jamerson again. \u201c...haven\u2019t played it since launch. I just turned my computer off last night and noticed it was still running.\u201d \n\n\n\n____\n\nI rarely write, so if I could get some feedback, I'd really appreciate it.

Tell the shuttle scientists to prepare a zero gravity litter box\""], [12, "\"It's beautiful, isn't it,\" Sean Murray said as we watched the curve of the Earth sink beneath us, a parabola completing its arc into a sphere. My whole world sunk away and became just another planet spinning in its place through the cosmos, then a marble, then a distant point of light. Sean was at peace now, all the nervous energy of the buildup to launch dissipated, his scraggly work-beard shaved clean. It was if time itself had turned backwards and undone entropy, undone disappointment and resentment, turned back time to that single moment of hope.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" I said. \n\nWe were aboard a Korvax freighter - not that the Korvax necessarily existed -  but the gleaming architecture was so familiar, like the dozens of space stations I had visited except infinitely more complex. Around us there was the constant bustle of military personnel, scientists, the familiar floating Sentinel drones. Sean and I stood on the observation bay, watching the stars stretch out and return to pure light, their gleaming aftertrails clinging to us as we warped past at hyperdrive. It was real. It was all so beautifully real. \n\n\"Well,\" Sean said, and coughed. \"We ought to get you suited up, hm?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, sure,\" I said, and tore my eyes away from the majesty of space. Playing No Man's Sky had been a meditative experience, a gentle meander through the universe, stopping to stock up on minerals and name a bunch of species after dicks. I should have been nervous, seeing it for real, being torn away from my home. But instead there was a familiar tranquility to the scene. I walked, Sean leading me by the hand, down to the launch bay with barely a thought in my head. There was a music sounding in the back of my skull, a reverberation. There were half a dozen ships at dock, flight crews wandering back and forth, other pilots strapping in...\n\n\"Your ship,\" Sean Murray said, and presented me with a boxy little craft. It looked sweet, almost homey, but there was something wrong. Something not quite right. \n\n\"Yeah, sure,\" I said. The music was getting louder - no, not louder. Deeper. A more intense reverberation. It almost hurt. Other pilots. Why were there other pilots? \"I thought-\" I said, and gestured vaguely around the launch bay. \"Why are there other people here? I thought you said I was the only one. The most time logged, right?\" \n\n\"Hm,\" Sean Murray said, and boosted me up into the cockpit. I slid in almost instinctively, the glass sealing shut around me. \"I did tell you that, didn't I?\" Sean's voice said in my ear. I shifted uncomfortably. It was tiny in here, almost claustrophobic, barely bigger than a cubicle. There was a small sharp prick at the back of my neck, something cold slipping in-between my vertebrae, and the tension vanished almost instantly. I sunk back down into the seat. \n\n\"You understand what to, don't you?\" Sean Murray's voice said. I blinked. The world was shifting color. Green blue pink orange. \"You mine. You bring back resources. Just like you were trained to do. Just like you've always done.\" \n\nI brought my hand down loosely on the controls, felt the autopilot shift into life, felt the ship respond beneath me. \"Who were all those other people?\" I said. The ship rocked soothingly under me. There was a sudden lurch forward and my ship was launched out into the vacuum, floating effortlessly to space. It was so lonely. So empty. I saw a coordinate light up and pushed forward by instinct, shooting forward through space. The planetoid ahead of me was grey, barren - and then the thing in my spine pulsed cold for a second, and the world shifted. The planetoid lit up in a pastel haze. \"Sean,\" I muttered through my headset. \"Sean. Am I being drugged?\"\n\n\"It's for the best,\" his voice said quietly, and there was the old nervous hitch to it, the smiling edge of a lie. \"It'd be a bit much to expect you to function otherwise. Every planet a new experience. Every rocky terrain a new hallucinogenically-generated world.\" My ship touched down automatically on the surface, and there were horses with wings flying past, skittering things with the heads of bananas dashing past my ship. The cockpit slid open and I took the first instinctive steps out. \n\n\"You wanted to explore the universe,\" Sean said, as I took out my mining laser and began cutting through the ore. There was a hysteric string threaded through his voice, vibrating madly and making it hitch. \"But you couldn't have known. I couldn't have known. It was true, all of it, all of it. The outposts. The Sentinels. Mankind stepped into the final frontier and discovered that there was nothing left to discover. That someone had been there before us and claimed it all first.\" \n\n\"I don't mind,\" I muttered, jetpacking lazily across the surface. There were birds with six wings flapping overhead. The sky was a whistling green. I took a picture. There was a whole world - a whole galaxy - to explore. \"That's why you picked me, isn't it? Why you picked us?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" he said, his voice sounding calmer, more resigned. \"The government - they trained a generation on these Skinner box games, picked out the best of the best. We were trying to be kind. That's all I wanted to do. I was trying to be kind. Earth's been a Korvax colony since the nineteen-sixties. They've been conscripting us for slave labor, using us to fuel their empire. Do you know what it's been like knowing that? You know what it's been like looking around at the whole unsuspecting world and knowing that we are owned?\" \n\n\"There's no need to be worried,\" I said. The tower of Heridium stretched up before me, and I aimed up my laser and began to mine. All the lights were beeping, all the voices in my ear, as I switched between screens and refueled my shields, my filters, my mining beam, keeping the delicate balance carefully in order. \"This is great. I'm having a good time. You made a great game.\" \n\n\"You would think that, wouldn't you?\" Sean said, his voice a sigh. \"Better to be hated, right? Better to be hated and thought a liar, than to tell everyone an incomprehensible truth.\" The sobs started, low and rhythmic, through the comm. \"I had to. I had to find you. I had to find people who wouldn't mind being lied to.\" \n\nMy hand found the switch next to my ear, and I pressed it and cut Sean Murray off. I liked him, I really did, and I wished he would be happy with what he had made. But he was talking too much, and distracting me from the task at hand. With the whole world floating hallucinogenic around me, I watched the mountain of Heridium slowly disappear beneath my beam, and took the first step forward to the rest of my life.

And it's boring.\n\nAs someone who appreciates game design, especially when designed to look like space, I decided that No Man's Sky was really shitty. It was a really shitty game with no cool space graphics. \n\n\"Wow, it really is No Man's Sky, because there's no one here,\" I mumbled into my mic, walking around.\n\nI decided to play more, advancing to see if the game got more interesting. It didn't.\n\nIt was so unfortunate, after $60 and a few good critic reviews, I had ended up buying a bland game with bland design. It's been around 47 hours of gameplay later, because I really wanted this game to be good. Almost everyone has stopped playing at this point, but I haven't.\n\nEven at this point, I've removed my mic headset because there's no one to talk to. Suddenly, I heard loud static in my earphones, overpowering my eardrums. I winced and took them off, only to hear:\n\n\"Can you hear me? My name is Charlie.\"\n\nI decided to plug in my mic headset and talk to him. I mean , this was my first player encounter. \n\n\"Hi, I'm Mark,\" I said warily.\n\n\"I work for the government. The NSA, to be exact.\"\n\nI dropped my controller, backing away from my screen. How the hell did the government find me?\n\n\"We've been using this game as a survey. The bland landscape is intentional. It allows us to monitor people's perception to boring landscapes. You haven't had your headset on as much as we would like, so we don't have many exact brainwaves. But, your timer reads around 47.5 hours.\"\n\n\"What does this mean for me?\" I asked.\n\n\"It means we're choosing you to go into space and lead the colonization of Mars,\" Charlie said. He then shouted off to his coworkers, \"We've got one!\"\n\nI pulled out my phone, and looked at my messages. I had 15 missed calls from a blocked number. As I went to unlock my phone, the number rang me again. I picked up.\n\n\"Hello, this is Mark.\"\n\n\"Hi, Mr. Fischbach. My name is Gunnar, and we want you to start today.\"\n\nTo be continued maybe??????"], [4, "\"Commander,\" Captain Shelley's voice came over the intercomm, \"They've found our pilot.\"\n\nCommander Quinn had been waiting for this announcement. He picked up his phone and started making the appropriate phone calls.\n\nJulie had just packed a second bowl. She had bought this game called No Man's Sky for her boyfriend, but he found it \"boring.\" The store wouldn't refund her the money for the game, so she decided that she could make it tolerable and play it herself, hence \"sparking it up.\" I'll show him, she thought to herself, that this game is playable and that I don't waste money! So, she'd been smoking up and playing every night since she got it. It was pretty fun, and easy to lose herself in the world when she was taking bong rips.\n\nShe heard noise outside of her window while she took a big hit. Not two seconds later, her front door kicked in.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she started sobbing, \"it was just a little bit of weed, I thought I'd try it...\"\n\n\"Julie Baker? Don't worry, we don't care about the weed. You need to come with us.\" Commander Quinn said to Julie. Julie just started at him blankly.\n\n\"She's baked, sir.\" Said Captain Quinn.\n\n\"Which is exactly how we need her to survive the trip. Stock the Replicator with stoner food and get me extracts of the highest quality bud you can find! Buy out whole stores in Colorado if you must! Julie has a long trip ahead of her.\" The agents nodded, two of them scurrying off to Colorado while the rest of them started packing Julie's things for aboard the spacecraft; they had decided a long time ago that familiarity would help the pilot keep their sanity.\n\n\"What are you talking about, man? Why are you guys in here and packing my things?\" Julie said, finally breaking out of her stupor for two seconds.\n\n\"You are the one who is going to revolutionize space travel! We needed someone to go and make first contact, but without hypersleep, it's a long, boring task. You have to...\" Commander Quinn realized that she had gone back into her stupor again and was playing No Man's Sky and not really paying attention to him.\n\n\"So, if I go with you, can you buy me a pizza on the way?\" Julie asked him, breaking the silence. "], [4, "\"Damn dude...this game sucks...you want to go see Suicide Squad?\" \nMy friend nods in mutual agreement. I sit down the controller and head to the car. As my friend Jeff and I drive to the movie theater we continue to talk about No Man's Sky. My friend was originally going to buy the game that evening and we were going to have a killer time playing multiplayer and finding planets, the only problem is that there is no multiplayer.\n\"Damn dude...that movie sucked. I'm just going to give up and go to sleep, maybe tomorrow won't be such a let down.\" I say to my friend as I drop him off at his house.\n\nWhen I get home, I crawl into bed, throughly disappointed in all the money I wasted that day.\n\nI wake up to my bedroom full of U.S. Army generals and NASA specialists standing around my bed. \"Brian Murphy?\" one of the bigger military men says in an unsure voice. I still wiping the sleep out of my eyes in disbelief of what is actually happening. \"Are you the Brian Murphy that has been playing No Man's Sky for the past 20 hours?\" I look over at my Playstation and see that it's still on. \"Uh...I guess\" I say back to the man. \"Good, we have a special mission for you. We need to discover the center of the universe.\" It's the last thing I hear him say before a bag is thrown over my head and I'm knocked unconscious.\n\nI wake up in a ship that looks exactly like that garbage from No Man's Sky. \"Alright Brian, prepare for takeoff.\" I hear through my headset. \"B-but but what do I do? How to I fly this thing.\" It's too late to ask questions now, the ship has already taken off. \"Don't worry the controller is in front of you, it's EXACTLY like the game. Do you copy?\"\nSilence.\n\"Brian...?\"\nSilence. Suddenly the radar blip disappears from the mission control screen.\n\"Sir, I think we lost him.\"\n\n\"Dammit, he was our only hope...\""], [5, "\"So - what do you say, son?\"\n\nThe man who asked me that question was what I imagined a stereotypical career military man would be - immaculately pressed uniform, medals and ribbons galore, and a classic look straight from the Tommy Lee Jones School of Facial Expressions.  The other two people flanking him at the large table in front of me had introduced themselves as NASA researchers.  And there I was, sitting on a little folding chair like I was at a group interview - or getting grilled by a Congressional committee.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" I stammered, nervously clearing my throat.  \"I wouldn't mind taking part.  I do have some concerns....\"\n\n\"If you're concerned with means of transport and survival, that will be provided,\" one of the NASA people replied.  \"Our R&D branch has designed all the necessary equipment - exosuit, faster-than-light drive, multitool - everything you are familiar with from the simulation.\"\n\n\"You mean the game?\" I raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Well, son, you're part right,\" the senior Air Force officer nodded.  \"It was released as a game.  But it was all part of our selection and recruitment process.  Once the news that it didn't have all the features promised, it narrowed down our selection pool rather easily for us.\"\n\n\"So, I spent $60 on a government-funded simulation?\"\n\n\"You did, and on behalf of the United States government, we'd like to apologize for it,\" the other scientist chimed in.\n\n\"Pfeh, typical bait-and-switch.\"\n\n\"But it was with good intentions,\" the other scientist riposted.  \"You are aware that NASA is trying to secure funding for exploration outside of our Solar System.  You would be making history with this project.\"\n\nI sat there for a while, thinking it over.  My fantasies of exploring the cosmos were coming true, all on the government's dime.  The trio at the table sat silent, waiting for me to say \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\n\"Okay.  I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Alright.  We'll get started right away.\"\n\n\n~~~~~\n\nThe following few days were a bit of a whirlwind.  Physicals, psychological evaluations, security clearance background checks.  The next thing I knew, I was standing in a hangar in a place I'd never thought I'd be.\n\n\"Welcome to Groom Lake,\" a man in aviator sunglasses smiled.  \"My name's Weller.\"\n\n\"Name's Sam.\"  We shook hands.  \"I guess I can't ask you your first name?\"\n\n\"Just call me Weller,\" my guide replied.  \"Need-to-know basis.  I'm sure you understand.\"\n\n\"It was crazy enough to get security clearance to get here, so I'm not worried.\"  I gestured toward the further interior of the hangar.  \"So - what do you have for me?\"\n\n\"Options.  We've examined the telemetry - you are capable with all three classes of spacecraft.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I smirked, \"I did play a fair bit of X-Wing vs TIE Fighter in my day, so I think I can handle flying.  Hopefully I don't need an instrument rating.\"\n\n\"With your telemetry, I don't think you'd need worry,\" Weller smiled.  \"With forty-plus hours of data, I think you'll be fine.\"\n\n\"To think I logged on to kill time after work,\" I joked.\n\n\"Funny how that works, huh?\"  Weller replied. \"Come on.  We need to get you settled in.\"\n\nWeller led me deeper into the hangar, where technicians were busying themselves with three craft - which I immediately recognized as Explorer, Fighter, and Trader type ships from the game.  Weller paused to let me take it all in.\n\n\"What do you think, Sam?\" he rumbled from over my right shoulder.\n\n\"Jesus, they're almost exactly like the ones in the game.\"\n\n\"We figured you'd like them; the designs you saw in the game were actually based on a couple of mock-ups and prototypes.  These are based on the ones that you preferred the most.\"\n\n\"Walk me through it, Q.\"\n\nWe made our way to the ships and Weller picked up the explanation.\n\n\"This right here is the X85 Echo,\" Weller began.  \"This is similar to the Explorer ships you saw in the game.  Pretty rudimentary; good sized cargo holds for whatever resources you can scrounge, decent defense systems.  We've installed all the basics on there, and if you find upgrades, there's a basic AI installed to guide you through installation.\"\n\n\"Communications?\" I asked.\n\n\"We've got that covered,\" Weller replied.  \"Sub-space comms array.  Complicated stuff.  But the important thing is, it works.\"\n\n\"Faster than radio waves?\"\n\n\"Much faster.  Not my department, but the eggheads tell me that we could easily communicate with you in almost real-time.  Just a very slight delay - couple seconds max.\"\n\nI was intrigued.  I was apprehensive when I got the suits knocking at my apartment door, saying they were government representatives and I should go with them.  Now, here I was, getting the Q briefing at Area 51.  The hand in my pocket pinched my thigh without me thinking.  It hurt - this wasn't a dream.\n\nWeller kept on talking.  \"Here, Sam, is the X85 Foxtrot.  Fighter equivalent.  Speedier, better hull armor.  Similar armaments and usual perks.\"\n\n\"Sleek.\"\n\n\"The guys here enjoyed making that one.  Pays to be working at a place like this.\"\n\n\"I can tell.\" I gestured at the craft.  \"I can see Oxcart and Have Blue influences in this one.\"\n\nWeller smiled enigmatically.  Granted, those projects were declassfied years ago, but I got the feeling he was impressed.  It was either No Man's Sky or browsing Wikipedia between my mind-numbing retail job and my equally desolate social life.\n\n\"What about that third one?\"  I pointed to the last of the three.  \"Reminds me of the Serenity.\"\n\n\"Oh, the X85 Tango?\" Weller glanced over at it.  \"Pretty basic.  Lots of space, but it's a bit slow.  Good armor and shields, though.\"\n\n\"Surely the guys here at Groom Lake can hot-rod it, can they?\"  I didn't want to be exploring the deep expanse of interstellar space flying a milk truck.\n\n\"It would take time,\" Weller admitted.  \"But I don't see why not.\"\n\n\"Well, there's funding.\"  I knew damn well that big secret projects like this could be canceled at a moment's notice.\n\n\"We've got that covered.  Black budgets have a way of sticking around, provided the suits don't pull the plug.\"\n\nThe Tango was calling to me.  I turned to Weller with a resolute look on my face.\n\n\"I think I've made my choice, Weller.\"\n\n\"We'll get that souped up and ready to fly.\"\n\n\n~~~~\n\n\"KXTA Control to Forerunner, final systems check.\"\n\nI ran through the systems on the control panels in front of me.  Despite my worries, the first flights with one of Groom Lake's test pilots flying driver's ed with me were surprisingly easy.  There was a bit of those virtual training wheels left, mostly because I was still a civilian.  Thankfully, it was laid out as simply as the engineers could make it.  Everything I needed to know was on the three separate binnacles that formed a boundary between me and the viewports.  As I wrapped my exosuit-gloved hands around the center stick and the throttle, I felt the power of the engines reverberate through me.  And the spike of adrenaline ran like greased lightning through my veins.\n\n\"Forerunner to KXTA, all systems green. Requesting clearance for takeoff, over.\"\n\n\"Affirmative, Forerunner.  You are clear for victor tango.\"\n\n\"Roger that, out.\"  I switched off the comms and quickly double-checked my exosuit HUD.\n\nI paused.  This was the culmination of all the science-fiction dreams I had when I was a small boy.  And they were coming true.\n\n\"I am a leaf on the wind,\" I whispered to myself.  \"Watch how I soar.\""], [3, "Jim craned his neck and looked up at the building. It was an enormous concrete block, stretching out a hundred feet in every direction. There were three silver plaques about midway up the wall, each featuring some kind of heraldry, and there were some large letters carved above the centre plaque.\n\n    Brooklyn Battery Tunnel\n          Triborough\n            Bridge\n               &\n            Tunnel\n           Authority\n\nJim turned back to his Uber driver. \"You sure this is the right place?\"\n\nThe driver shrugged and tapped his GPS console. \"I just go where it tells me. 504 Battery Drive, here you are.\"\n\nJim nodded and thanked the driver. He paid his fare, and turned back to the building. There was a set of wooden doors at the base. Jim approached the doors and hesitated for a moment, not sure if it were appropriate to knock. He shrugged and pulled the door open. The hinges squeaked loudly and there was a rush of air. Jim stepped inside, and let the door fall shut. It looked to be some kind of ventilation tunnel. There was a massive fan on Jims right hand side, thrumming along loudly.\n\nA middle aged black man sat at the base of the fan. He was bald, wearing a black suit, and reading the newspaper. \"Help you?\" he asked, glancing up at Jim.\n\n\"Yeah, this lady gave me this phone call an--\"\n\"Elevator\" the man said, cutting Jim off. He gestured towards a pair of metallic doors before returning his attention to the newspaper.\n\nJim approached the elevator and pressed the call button. The doors slid open, and Jim stepped cautiously inside. There was a single button on the wall. Jim pressed it, and the doors closed and the elevator lurched into motion. It stopped a few moments later, and the doors opened.\n\n\"You're late\", a voice called. Jim stepped out of the elevator. The room was empty save for a couple egg-shaped chairs. There was a man standing next to one, and he gestured to it. \"Sit down\", he said.\n\nJim sat down.\n\n\"You're probably wondering why you're here\", the man said. He had brown hair and a greying beard, and looked to be in his early 60s. He wore a white shirt, a black suitjacket and a tie.\n\n\"Er, yeah. Kind of. The lady on the phone mentioned some kind of opportunity?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Dianne. I heard you hung up on her the first time she called.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you? I mean, well, \"I'm calling to offer you a unique and lucrative opportunity\", that whole spiel? Does anyone actually get through it the first time?\"\n\nThe man grinned, \"You called back quickly after you checked your bank account, though.\"\n\n\"My name is Zed\", he continued. \"Five years ago an alien spacecraft crashed outside the port of Manhattan. Most of the wreckage was completely destroyed, but we were able to recover a small portion of it, and we have been reverse engineering and testing it ever since. It became apparent early on that we were onto something big - Instantaneous transportation, and quite a detailed map detailing the locations of several solar systems capable of sustaining life.\"\n\nJim stared blankly for a moment, and realised he should probably say something. \"Oh. Uh, cool. But...why am I here?\"\n\n\"You're here because we need you. In order to open this technology up for mass transportation, we need an initial jumper to set up a series of relays. We discovered early on that using this technology and setting up the relays would take a man of particular talent, and so we started developing a test. Something that would weed out those unfit for duty. You are here, Jim, because you are the best of the best. You alone have the greatest chance of succeeding. And we need you to succeed. Frankly, we still don't fully understand what we're working with, and failure could result in a complete loss of this technology.\"\n\n\"And, er, there was some money involved?\"\n\nZed sighed. \"Yes, Jim. There is a lot of money involved.\"\n\nJim thought for a moment. \"Okay. I mean. I guess I can do it. You said there was a test?\"\n\n\"Yes, and you've aced it. You are, of course, familiar with the game 'No man's sky'?\"\n\nJim's eyes finally lit up, \"Oh! Yes! I can't wait to play it!\"\n\n\"Well, your mastery o--\" Zed frowned \"...Wait, what was that?\"\n\n\"I can't wait to play it!\" Jim exclaimed, \"I started the download, but I had this stupid work thing and had to go away for the weekend.\"\n\nZed stared at Jim and began to speak slowly \"...You mean you haven't played?\"\n\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\nZed slowly pulled out his phone, pressed a button, and held it to his ear. There was a moment of silence and then he said, \"Hello Dianne, could you pull up the winning Steam profile for me please?\"\n\nThere was a brief pause and then a faint noise at the other end, \"Yes, thank you Dianne. One moment.\"\n\nZed turned to Jim, \"You're JimmyJim32?\"\n\nJim nodded.\n\n\"No Man's Sky play time, 42 hours?\"\n\nJim frowned, \"No...Oh! I must have ticked the box to open it as soon as the download completed. I haven't been home since then!\"\n\nZed closed his eyes and took a deep breath.\n\n\"Dianne, dear? Did you check the winners achievements before you called him?\"\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\"Yes, that is a bit of a problem, isn't it? We'll have to go with the runner up. Could you check his play time for me, and possibly confirm that he's actually *played the game*? Yes, thank you Dianne.\"\n\nZed sat down and leaned back, closing his eyes. He pressed the speaker phone button, and set his phone on his lap. A few minutes passed in silence, and then Dianne's voice came back to the phone. \u201cYou there, Zed? I've found the runner up. Let me see here, looks like he's played uhh...13 hours...Oh dear.\""], [3, "Rob sat at his chair, gazing at the screen. Just another day of playing No Man's Sky, exploring the vast galaxies. Chips were scattered across the Oriental carpet, also stained by booze and soda. He was just having a fun time, but what he didn't know, was that 500 miles away, in a secret military base, a general was looking at his Steam account. \n\n*Somewhere, in Nevada*\n\n\"What the-\" General Waller said. \n\nHe rubbed his eyes. Maybe the countless hours searching for a player had gotten to him. \n\n\"Chang! Are you seeing what I'm seeing?\" \n\nThe general slowly raised his head from his desk, then stumbled over drunkenly to his fellow general. His eyes widened as he read the time on the screen. In an instant, the general went from semi-hangover to energetic. He did a celebration dance, but General Waller stopped him. \n\n\"We have to confirm this.\"\n\nRob was looking at his screen, all relaxed, when suddenly, there was a stinging pain, then the world went black. He later woke up in a empty room, with a light hanging over his head, like in horror movies. A figure approached from the darkness, and Rob  fainted. The last words he heard were, \"God dammit, Rob!\"\n\nRob woke up yet again, but this time in a well conditioned room. The room was illuminated with light this time, and the was a working air conditioner. General Waller approached Rob.\n\n\"We saw that you have 42 hours put into the game No Man's Sky. Is this true?\"\n\nRob was confused. \"Wha.. Wha.. Uhh..\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I should introduce myself. My name is General Waller, part of the U.S. Armed Forces. No Man's Sky was a test made by our scientists to determine who was capable of enduring extended periods of boredom before succumbing to insanity. You have put the most time into the game, an astounding *42 hours* straight. Our test results show you are capable of surviving 20 years of boredom, double the amount of time needed to make the trip to another galaxy.\"\n\nRob took a long time to understand what the general was saying. After a long silence, he said, \"Uhh.. ok?\"\n\nGeneral Waller's eyes brightened, and he exclaimed, \"Great! You will be leaving in roughly 2 hours.\"\n\n\"Wait, what about my friends and family? Don't I get to say goodbye?\"\n\n\"Nah, too heartbreaking. Besides, you barely interacted with them.

Before he took his last breath of air, he looked around the room at the only people who ever agreed with him on his favorite game."], [2, "\"Rick, come watch Camera 893.\"\n\nRick shuffled over, adjusting his glasses slightly, stuffing a potato chip into his mouth, and set his gaze towards a gigantic wall of monitors.\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"893, right there.\" Thomas pointed at a screen showing a large bald man, sitting eerily on a couch which he mostly occupied, in a room filled with cans, discarded food containers.\n\n\"Ohhhh yeah... oh I gotcha you little fucker!\" Barry exclaimed as he chased after a pig shaped mammal.\n\n\"Thumpawumpasaurus... Junior. Haha. \", he swiftly grabbed a notebook next to him, and started furiously writing.\n\n\"He... he's enjoying it.\" Rick said, with a dumbfounded look on his face.\n\nSuddenly a shriek came through the monitor, causing Thomas and Rick to pause.\n\n\"God damn it Barry! You no good, fat, stupid, waste of space! I told you to get the hell up, and go get some Groceries. You been playing that game for 42 straight hours! Your kids are starving, and I am at my wits end!\"\n\nRick gasped, \"Did she... did she say 42 hours!\"\n\nThomas nodded, shaking his head with a faint smile on his face, his hand pointing towards a line on his own monitor.\n\nRick looked down towards it, reading swiftly.\n\n\"Barry Darringer, married, white, male, 38 years old. 42.327 hours logged.\"\n\n\"I'll go in a minute Wanda! Jeez. Can't I just have a minute to play my game. Let me catalogue this last animal, and I'll go.\" Barry exclaimed, fiddling with his notebook.\n\n\"Get a move on buddy, or I'm taking me and the kids to Momma's house again.\"   And with that Wanda stomped out the door.\n\n\"Huhuh...\" Barry raced towards a rotund purple dinosaur like creature.\n\n\"Wandabitchus Rexmaxiumus Fatmington\" he giggled to himself.\n\n\"This... this is the one.\" Thomas said, turning to Rick, \"You fucking found him.\"\n\nBarry and Rick raced out to their surveillance van, wearing their usual black suits and ties, and sped towards Barry's address.\n\n*Knock* *Knock*\n\n\"Damnit Wanda! Just open the door, I'm still busy naming this Galocksmosaurus!\"\n\n\"Hi... it's not Wanda, we... we are here looking for Barry.\"\nThomas yelled through the screen.\n\nBarry grunted as he pulled himself off the couch, and wandered towards the door.\n\n\"Look guys, I'm kind of in the middle of some important work here, okay? I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone so I can get back to it.\"\n\n\"You mean, the work of naming the Wandabitchus Rexmaxiumus Fa...\"\n\nBarry interrupted, \"Oh bullshit! There is no way you found my planet! The developers said that was like, almost impossible!\"\n\n\"We... we are part of a firm that created No Man's Sky, Barry.\" Thomas said, \n\n\"Alright, great thanks for the game, but I really got to get back to it alright, I have a whole goddamn universe to name.\"\n\n\"Barry... Barry listen... We created No Man's Sky as a social experiment. We were looking for humans that would be ideal for a mission of utmost importance to the fate of hum...\"\n\nBarry interrupted, \"Holy shit, you just aren't listening to me... this shit isn't just going to name itself!\"\n\n\"B...Barry.. hold on!\" Rick exclaimed,\n\n\"It's all pointless, we wipe the server every two weeks anyways. The whole fucking system is stored on a forty gigabyte drive we bought at Walmart. It was programmed by Indian Outsource engineers in two weeks. We really didn't expect anyone to still be playing longer than twenty hours.\"\n\n\"But you did... Barry.. you did... you beat everyone's expectations, you're the perfect candidate.\"\nThomas said, raising his hands towards Barry.\n\n\"The.. the monotony, it's based off of our missions. We sent a probe thirty years ago towards Alpha Centari, in it carrying the hope of humanity, our best and brightest. We have cataloged potentially habitable planets, but the multitudes are desolate, uninhabited, wastelands.\"\n\nRick said, looking pleadingly towards Barry.\n\n\"We were so wrong, their brilliant minds, every one of them, cracked... They joined the trip thinking they would be like Captain Kirk, heading out into the great unknown, but with every planet, it was that same red dust, the empty space, the nothingness. All while knowing their children are aging, their lives dwindling, and it would all be for nothing. They landed on the surface of those desolate worlds, breathed the dust, the empty atmospheres, and in the nothingness lost themselves to it. But in the end... in the end we have to find that habitable planet, that precious blue dot floating in the midst of the infinite dreck of nothingness and blight.\"\n\nAnd with this Thomas paused. Looking towards Barry.\n\n\"We need you Barry. Your country needs you.\"\n\n\"You're just like Wanda... Won't give me a goddamn minute to play my game, and catalog.\"\n\nBarry said, turning away from both of them, fidgeting his notebook in one hand as he sighed.\n\n\"Barry.. no... we.. you heard us, they wipe it! It's pointless, meaningless, it...\"\n\n*SLAM* Barry slammed the door in their face, fiddling with the lock, jamming it behind him wandering back to the couch.\n\n\"Barry! Barry, you're our only hope!\"\nThomas yelled, before hearing the volume raised, the same blaring nonsense music spinning endlessly in a loop of tortured meaninglessness.\n"], [-1, "As I place my bottle of Jack on the coffee table and sat on my comfy sofa, I realized buying this game wasn't worth it.\n\nFuck!\n\nAll it offers is procedurally-generated planets to explore while riding your fancy spaceship and nothing more.

Mason was sitting quietly in his living room only feet away, mindlessly flipping through television stations. Infomercials, reruns, and talk shows flashed across the screen, only for him to stop on Good Morning America. The knocks startled him and his head snapped towards the door. The brief moment of panic settled and he stood up, muttering to himself as he went to look through the peephole. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 7:30. Can\u2019t you Jehovah\u2019s wait until I leave for work\u2026\u201d\n\nTwo well-dressed men stood at his door, both nearly identical in appearance; tinted aviators, a charcoal suit and tie, and a brass tie bar which held their silky accessory in place. \n\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Mason asked the two as he cracked the door, trying his best to sound polite through his groggy voice. \n\n\u201cMister McCormick, this is First Lieutenant Figueroa, and I\u2019m Captain Underwood. We\u2019re with the United States Air Force Security Forces. Would you mind stepping outside for a moment?\u201d \n\nMason had opened the door completely at this point, placing himself between the airmen and his living room. Captain Underwood had removed a wallet-sized badge from his jacket pocket and offered it to Mason as he stepped outside and closed the door behind him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d Mason asked, seeming a bit less polite than before. He grabbed the badge hastily and opened it, looking it over curiously. \n\nFigueroa piped up, \u201cWe\u2019ve been ordered to bring you in for questioning. Please come with us.\u201d he said, turning sideways and motioning towards the nondescript white Chevrolet that was parked in front of the home. \n\n\u201cQuestioning for what? I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d Mason replied, tilting his head a bit as he slipped the badge back into Underwood\u2019s palm. \u201cDo you have a warran- do you even have the authority to do that?\u201d he asked loudly, backing up a bit towards the door. \n\nUnderwood sighed and slowly pulled the left-side of his suit jacket back, revealing a holstered handgun. He rested his hand on the grip and fixed his eyes on Mason.\n\n\u201cMister McCormick, you need to come with us. You can walk yourself to the car or we can bring you there ourselves.\u201d the Captain insisted, stepping back a bit to give Mason room to comply.\n\nAnd he did. \n\nMason swore up and down underneath his breath as he walked towards the car with Figueroa in tow. Confused, angry, and tired, Mason wasn\u2019t sure what he had gotten himself into. The door slammed quickly as he was placed in the backseat, Underwood taking the helm and Figueroa riding shotgun. The car began moving as a quick exchange went out via radio between the First Lieutenant and a staticy female voice:\n\n>\u201cThis is First Lieutenant Figueroa, Spaceman has been secured.\u201d\n>\n>\u201c[Inaudible] ...unharmed?\u201d\n>\n>\u201cAffirmative.\u201d\n\nMason fidgeted with his fingers as he stared out of the car\u2019s window, both of the suits remaining completely silent. They passed over the Spokane River and Latah Creek before Mason finally spoke. \n\n\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d he asked, leaning forward in his seat, head almost parallel to the two in front of him.\n\n\u201cSit back.\u201d Figueroa said quickly.\n\nAssisted by a harsh shove from the Captain, Mason rested against the backseat, eyes focused on the ceiling of the car. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening. This can\u2019t. What did I even do wrong?\u201d he thought to himself, sighing heavily. The reality of the situation starting to set in.\n\nThirty minutes passed before the car began to slow to a crawl, the trio passing through a gate with two armed guardsmen on each side. Mason glanced out of the window at the sign near their booths: *Fairchild Air Force Base* it read, the emblem matching the one on Captain Underwood\u2019s badge.\n\nThe car moved quickly through the base afterwards, passing a grounded pair of tanker planes before coming to a complete halt inside of a dark, nearly-empty hangar. The door of the hangar began to slowly descend, the two suits refusing to exit the vehicle until it was closed entirely. \n\n\u201cGet out.\u201d Figueroa said, pulling the backdoor open. \u201cQuickly now.\u201d he insisted, watching Mason step out onto the concrete ground. \n\n\u201cGeneral Jamerson.\u201d Underwood said loudly, closing his door and offering a salute to the man in blue who had begun to approach them. \n\n\u201cCaptain Underwood.\u201d the figure said, returning the salute briefly before his attention turned to Mason. He stared for a moment before a grin crossed his face, turning on his heel. \u201cGood. Get him to the table.\u201d he said, starting back towards the center of the hangar. \n\nFigueroa quickly grabbed Mason\u2019s arm and shoulder, and Mason quickly yelped at the sudden forcefulness. \n\n \u201cGet the fuck off of me!\u201d he yelled, writhing and trying to escape the First Lieutenant\u2019s grip, but to no avail. He was pulled towards the center of the structure and tossed hastily into a folding chair in front of a plastic table. Figueroa and Underwood exchanged nods and fixed their eyes on Mason, hands resting on the grips of their weapons. \n\n\u201cMister McCormick\u2026\u201d General Jamerson said, thumbing through a manila folder that rested on the table. \u201cHave you ever heard of a game called *No Man\u2019s Sky*?\u201d he asked, placing his fingers together as he looks up at Mason with a grin.\n\n\u201cYe- why does that matter? Why am I here?!\u201d Mason said quickly, irritated by the General\u2019s seemingly irrelevant question. Sweat started to slowly drip down his face and he felt his stomach begin to turn. This was really happening.\n\nGeneral Jamerson looked between the Captain and First Lieutenant, then back to Mason. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been selected for an incredibly important national security initiative, Mister McCormick.

A red *TOP SECRET; CLASSIFIED MATERIAL* header was visible.\n\nMason\u2019s face twisted as he settled back in the chair, realizing he would be unable to flee no matter how hard he tried. His face turned pale and his heart pounded faster than normal.\n\n\u201cWhy me? What could I possibly do for you?\u201d he asked slowly, arms falling to his side.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, if we could have gotten better, we would have. But you, Mason, you\u2019re the best we\u2019ve got. We even had Secretary Mabus discuss this with Scott Kelly, but he wasn\u2019t able to make it through training.\u201d Jamerson said, standing up from his seat and slowly moving to the other side of the table.\n\n\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d he asked, placing his hand on Mason\u2019s shoulder in an attempt to comfort the captive.\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Mason replied, looking Jamerson\u2019s face over. \u201cYou have to have the wrong guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you, of all people, make it to 46 hours in *No Man\u2019s Sky*? I tried it. These two tried it\u2026\u201d he motioned to Figueroa and Underwood. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our best pilots try it. The Navy had their best submariners and aviators try it. Two of them went completely mad at 20 hours.\u201d the General sighed and paused for a moment, taking a deep breath. His grip tightened.\n\n\u201cSo tell me, Mason, how did you do it?\u201d\n\nMason quirked a brow at the General, looking between both of the suits that had taken him from his home and then back to Jamerson. He opened his mouth briefly before slamming it shut, still trying to process everything that\u2019s happened so far. The sweating stopped for the most part and the stomach pain had nearly subsided. \n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d he fixed his eyes on General Jamerson again. \u201c...haven\u2019t played it since launch.

My whole world sunk away and became just another planet spinning in its place through the cosmos, then a marble, then a distant point of light. Sean was at peace now, all the nervous energy of the buildup to launch dissipated, his scraggly work-beard shaved clean. It was if time itself had turned backwards and undone entropy, undone disappointment and resentment, turned back time to that single moment of hope.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" I said. \n\nWe were aboard a Korvax freighter - not that the Korvax necessarily existed -  but the gleaming architecture was so familiar, like the dozens of space stations I had visited except infinitely more complex. Around us there was the constant bustle of military personnel, scientists, the familiar floating Sentinel drones. Sean and I stood on the observation bay, watching the stars stretch out and return to pure light, their gleaming aftertrails clinging to us as we warped past at hyperdrive. It was real. It was all so beautifully real. \n\n\"Well,\" Sean said, and coughed. \"We ought to get you suited up, hm?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, sure,\" I said, and tore my eyes away from the majesty of space. Playing No Man's Sky had been a meditative experience, a gentle meander through the universe, stopping to stock up on minerals and name a bunch of species after dicks. I should have been nervous, seeing it for real, being torn away from my home. But instead there was a familiar tranquility to the scene. I walked, Sean leading me by the hand, down to the launch bay with barely a thought in my head. There was a music sounding in the back of my skull, a reverberation. There were half a dozen ships at dock, flight crews wandering back and forth, other pilots strapping in...\n\n\"Your ship,\" Sean Murray said, and presented me with a boxy little craft. It looked sweet, almost homey, but there was something wrong. Something not quite right. \n\n\"Yeah, sure,\" I said. The music was getting louder - no, not louder. Deeper. A more intense reverberation. It almost hurt. Other pilots. Why were there other pilots? \"I thought-\" I said, and gestured vaguely around the launch bay. \"Why are there other people here? I thought you said I was the only one. The most time logged, right?\" \n\n\"Hm,\" Sean Murray said, and boosted me up into the cockpit. I slid in almost instinctively, the glass sealing shut around me. \"I did tell you that, didn't I?\" Sean's voice said in my ear. I shifted uncomfortably. It was tiny in here, almost claustrophobic, barely bigger than a cubicle. There was a small sharp prick at the back of my neck, something cold slipping in-between my vertebrae, and the tension vanished almost instantly. I sunk back down into the seat. \n\n\"You understand what to, don't you?\" Sean Murray's voice said. I blinked. The world was shifting color. Green blue pink orange. \"You mine. You bring back resources. Just like you were trained to do. Just like you've always done.\" \n\nI brought my hand down loosely on the controls, felt the autopilot shift into life, felt the ship respond beneath me. \"Who were all those other people?\" I said. The ship rocked soothingly under me. There was a sudden lurch forward and my ship was launched out into the vacuum, floating effortlessly to space. It was so lonely. So empty. I saw a coordinate light up and pushed forward by instinct, shooting forward through space. The planetoid ahead of me was grey, barren - and then the thing in my spine pulsed cold for a second, and the world shifted. The planetoid lit up in a pastel haze. \"Sean,\" I muttered through my headset. \"Sean. Am I being drugged?\"\n\n\"It's for the best,\" his voice said quietly, and there was the old nervous hitch to it, the smiling edge of a lie. \"It'd be a bit much to expect you to function otherwise. Every planet a new experience. Every rocky terrain a new hallucinogenically-generated world.\" My ship touched down automatically on the surface, and there were horses with wings flying past, skittering things with the heads of bananas dashing past my ship. The cockpit slid open and I took the first instinctive steps out. \n\n\"You wanted to explore the universe,\" Sean said, as I took out my mining laser and began cutting through the ore. There was a hysteric string threaded through his voice, vibrating madly and making it hitch. \"But you couldn't have known. I couldn't have known. It was true, all of it, all of it. The outposts. The Sentinels. Mankind stepped into the final frontier and discovered that there was nothing left to discover. That someone had been there before us and claimed it all first.\" \n\n\"I don't mind,\" I muttered, jetpacking lazily across the surface. There were birds with six wings flapping overhead. The sky was a whistling green. I took a picture. There was a whole world - a whole galaxy - to explore. \"That's why you picked me, isn't it? Why you picked us?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" he said, his voice sounding calmer, more resigned. \"The government - they trained a generation on these Skinner box games, picked out the best of the best. We were trying to be kind. That's all I wanted to do. I was trying to be kind. Earth's been a Korvax colony since the nineteen-sixties. They've been conscripting us for slave labor, using us to fuel their empire. Do you know what it's been like knowing that? You know what it's been like looking around at the whole unsuspecting world and knowing that we are owned?\" \n\n\"There's no need to be worried,\" I said. The tower of Heridium stretched up before me, and I aimed up my laser and began to mine. All the lights were beeping, all the voices in my ear, as I switched between screens and refueled my shields, my filters, my mining beam, keeping the delicate balance carefully in order. \"This is great. I'm having a good time. You made a great game.\" \n\n\"You would think that, wouldn't you?\" Sean said, his voice a sigh. \"Better to be hated, right? Better to be hated and thought a liar, than to tell everyone an incomprehensible truth.\" The sobs started, low and rhythmic, through the comm. \"I had to. I had to find you. I had to find people who wouldn't mind being lied to.\" \n\nMy hand found the switch next to my ear, and I pressed it and cut Sean Murray off. I liked him, I really did, and I wished he would be happy with what he had made. But he was talking too much, and distracting me from the task at hand. With the whole world floating hallucinogenic around me, I watched the mountain of Heridium slowly disappear beneath my beam, and took the first step forward to the rest of my life.

You would be making history with this project.\"\n\nI sat there for a while, thinking it over.  My fantasies of exploring the cosmos were coming true, all on the government's dime.  The trio at the table sat silent, waiting for me to say \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\n\"Okay.  I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Alright.  We'll get started right away.\"\n\n\n~~~~~\n\nThe following few days were a bit of a whirlwind.  Physicals, psychological evaluations, security clearance background checks.  The next thing I knew, I was standing in a hangar in a place I'd never thought I'd be.\n\n\"Welcome to Groom Lake,\" a man in aviator sunglasses smiled.  \"My name's Weller.\"\n\n\"Name's Sam.\"  We shook hands.  \"I guess I can't ask you your first name?\"\n\n\"Just call me Weller,\" my guide replied.  \"Need-to-know basis.  I'm sure you understand.\"\n\n\"It was crazy enough to get security clearance to get here, so I'm not worried.\"  I gestured toward the further interior of the hangar.  \"So - what do you have for me?\"\n\n\"Options.  We've examined the telemetry - you are capable with all three classes of spacecraft.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I smirked, \"I did play a fair bit of X-Wing vs TIE Fighter in my day, so I think I can handle flying.  Hopefully I don't need an instrument rating.\"\n\n\"With your telemetry, I don't think you'd need worry,\" Weller smiled.  \"With forty-plus hours of data, I think you'll be fine.\"\n\n\"To think I logged on to kill time after work,\" I joked.\n\n\"Funny how that works, huh?\"  Weller replied. \"Come on.  We need to get you settled in.\"\n\nWeller led me deeper into the hangar, where technicians were busying themselves with three craft - which I immediately recognized as Explorer, Fighter, and Trader type ships from the game.  Weller paused to let me take it all in.\n\n\"What do you think, Sam?\" he rumbled from over my right shoulder.\n\n\"Jesus, they're almost exactly like the ones in the game.\"\n\n\"We figured you'd like them; the designs you saw in the game were actually based on a couple of mock-ups and prototypes.  These are based on the ones that you preferred the most.\"\n\n\"Walk me through it, Q.\"\n\nWe made our way to the ships and Weller picked up the explanation.\n\n\"This right here is the X85 Echo,\" Weller began.  \"This is similar to the Explorer ships you saw in the game.  Pretty rudimentary; good sized cargo holds for whatever resources you can scrounge, decent defense systems.  We've installed all the basics on there, and if you find upgrades, there's a basic AI installed to guide you through installation.\"\n\n\"Communications?\" I asked.\n\n\"We've got that covered,\" Weller replied.  \"Sub-space comms array.  Complicated stuff.  But the important thing is, it works.\"\n\n\"Faster than radio waves?\"\n\n\"Much faster.  Not my department, but the eggheads tell me that we could easily communicate with you in almost real-time.  Just a very slight delay - couple seconds max.\"\n\nI was intrigued.  I was apprehensive when I got the suits knocking at my apartment door, saying they were government representatives and I should go with them.  Now, here I was, getting the Q briefing at Area 51.  The hand in my pocket pinched my thigh without me thinking.  It hurt - this wasn't a dream.\n\nWeller kept on talking.  \"Here, Sam, is the X85 Foxtrot.  Fighter equivalent.  Speedier, better hull armor.  Similar armaments and usual perks.\"\n\n\"Sleek.\"\n\n\"The guys here enjoyed making that one.  Pays to be working at a place like this.\"\n\n\"I can tell.\" I gestured at the craft.  \"I can see Oxcart and Have Blue influences in this one.\"\n\nWeller smiled enigmatically.  Granted, those projects were declassfied years ago, but I got the feeling he was impressed.  It was either No Man's Sky or browsing Wikipedia between my mind-numbing retail job and my equally desolate social life.\n\n\"What about that third one?\"  I pointed to the last of the three.  \"Reminds me of the Serenity.\"\n\n\"Oh, the X85 Tango?\" Weller glanced over at it.  \"Pretty basic.  Lots of space, but it's a bit slow.  Good armor and shields, though.\"\n\n\"Surely the guys here at Groom Lake can hot-rod it, can they?\"  I didn't want to be exploring the deep expanse of interstellar space flying a milk truck.\n\n\"It would take time,\" Weller admitted.  \"But I don't see why not.\"\n\n\"Well, there's funding.\"  I knew damn well that big secret projects like this could be canceled at a moment's notice.\n\n\"We've got that covered.  Black budgets have a way of sticking around, provided the suits don't pull the plug.\"\n\nThe Tango was calling to me.  I turned to Weller with a resolute look on my face.\n\n\"I think I've made my choice, Weller.\"\n\n\"We'll get that souped up and ready to fly.\"\n\n\n~~~~\n\n\"KXTA Control to Forerunner, final systems check.\"\n\nI ran through the systems on the control panels in front of me.  Despite my worries, the first flights with one of Groom Lake's test pilots flying driver's ed with me were surprisingly easy.  There was a bit of those virtual training wheels left, mostly because I was still a civilian.  Thankfully, it was laid out as simply as the engineers could make it.  Everything I needed to know was on the three separate binnacles that formed a boundary between me and the viewports.  As I wrapped my exosuit-gloved hands around the center stick and the throttle, I felt the power of the engines reverberate through me.  And the spike of adrenaline ran like greased lightning through my veins.\n\n\"Forerunner to KXTA, all systems green. Requesting clearance for takeoff, over.\"\n\n\"Affirmative, Forerunner.  You are clear for victor tango.\"\n\n\"Roger that, out.\"  I switched off the comms and quickly double-checked my exosuit HUD.\n\nI paused.  This was the culmination of all the science-fiction dreams I had when I was a small boy.  And they were coming true.\n\n\"I am a leaf on the wind,\" I whispered to myself.  \"Watch how I soar.\"", "id": "d6xwq44"}, {"comment": "Love it! Now I wanna go watch Serenity.

He paid his fare, and turned back to the building. There was a set of wooden doors at the base. Jim approached the doors and hesitated for a moment, not sure if it were appropriate to knock. He shrugged and pulled the door open. The hinges squeaked loudly and there was a rush of air. Jim stepped inside, and let the door fall shut. It looked to be some kind of ventilation tunnel. There was a massive fan on Jims right hand side, thrumming along loudly.\n\nA middle aged black man sat at the base of the fan. He was bald, wearing a black suit, and reading the newspaper. \"Help you?\" he asked, glancing up at Jim.\n\n\"Yeah, this lady gave me this phone call an--\"\n\"Elevator\" the man said, cutting Jim off. He gestured towards a pair of metallic doors before returning his attention to the newspaper.\n\nJim approached the elevator and pressed the call button. The doors slid open, and Jim stepped cautiously inside. There was a single button on the wall. Jim pressed it, and the doors closed and the elevator lurched into motion. It stopped a few moments later, and the doors opened.\n\n\"You're late\", a voice called. Jim stepped out of the elevator. The room was empty save for a couple egg-shaped chairs. There was a man standing next to one, and he gestured to it. \"Sit down\", he said.\n\nJim sat down.\n\n\"You're probably wondering why you're here\", the man said. He had brown hair and a greying beard, and looked to be in his early 60s. He wore a white shirt, a black suitjacket and a tie.\n\n\"Er, yeah. Kind of. The lady on the phone mentioned some kind of opportunity?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Dianne. I heard you hung up on her the first time she called.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you? I mean, well, \"I'm calling to offer you a unique and lucrative opportunity\", that whole spiel? Does anyone actually get through it the first time?\"\n\nThe man grinned, \"You called back quickly after you checked your bank account, though.\"\n\n\"My name is Zed\", he continued. \"Five years ago an alien spacecraft crashed outside the port of Manhattan. Most of the wreckage was completely destroyed, but we were able to recover a small portion of it, and we have been reverse engineering and testing it ever since. It became apparent early on that we were onto something big - Instantaneous transportation, and quite a detailed map detailing the locations of several solar systems capable of sustaining life.\"\n\nJim stared blankly for a moment, and realised he should probably say something. \"Oh. Uh, cool. But...why am I here?\"\n\n\"You're here because we need you. In order to open this technology up for mass transportation, we need an initial jumper to set up a series of relays. We discovered early on that using this technology and setting up the relays would take a man of particular talent, and so we started developing a test. Something that would weed out those unfit for duty. You are here, Jim, because you are the best of the best. You alone have the greatest chance of succeeding. And we need you to succeed. Frankly, we still don't fully understand what we're working with, and failure could result in a complete loss of this technology.\"\n\n\"And, er, there was some money involved?\"\n\nZed sighed. \"Yes, Jim. There is a lot of money involved.\"\n\nJim thought for a moment. \"Okay. I mean. I guess I can do it. You said there was a test?\"\n\n\"Yes, and you've aced it. You are, of course, familiar with the game 'No man's sky'?\"\n\nJim's eyes finally lit up, \"Oh! Yes! I can't wait to play it!\"\n\n\"Well, your mastery o--\" Zed frowned \"...Wait, what was that?\"\n\n\"I can't wait to play it!\" Jim exclaimed, \"I started the download, but I had this stupid work thing and had to go away for the weekend.\"\n\nZed stared at Jim and began to speak slowly \"...You mean you haven't played?\"\n\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\nZed slowly pulled out his phone, pressed a button, and held it to his ear. There was a moment of silence and then he said, \"Hello Dianne, could you pull up the winning Steam profile for me please?\"\n\nThere was a brief pause and then a faint noise at the other end, \"Yes, thank you Dianne. One moment.\"\n\nZed turned to Jim, \"You're JimmyJim32?\"\n\nJim nodded.\n\n\"No Man's Sky play time, 42 hours?\"\n\nJim frowned, \"No...Oh! I must have ticked the box to open it as soon as the download completed. I haven't been home since then!\"\n\nZed closed his eyes and took a deep breath.\n\n\"Dianne, dear? Did you check the winners achievements before you called him?\"\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\"Yes, that is a bit of a problem, isn't it? We'll have to go with the runner up. Could you check his play time for me, and possibly confirm that he's actually *played the game*? Yes, thank you Dianne.\"\n\nZed sat down and leaned back, closing his eyes. He pressed the speaker phone button, and set his phone on his lap. A few minutes passed in silence, and then Dianne's voice came back to the phone. \u201cYou there, Zed? I've found the runner up.

Just another day of playing No Man's Sky, exploring the vast galaxies. Chips were scattered across the Oriental carpet, also stained by booze and soda.

Maybe the countless hours searching for a player had gotten to him. \n\n\"Chang! Are you seeing what I'm seeing?\" \n\nThe general slowly raised his head from his desk, then stumbled over drunkenly to his fellow general. His eyes widened as he read the time on the screen. In an instant, the general went from semi-hangover to energetic. He did a celebration dance, but General Waller stopped him. \n\n\"We have to confirm this.\"\n\nRob was looking at his screen, all relaxed, when suddenly, there was a stinging pain, then the world went black. He later woke up in a empty room, with a light hanging over his head, like in horror movies. A figure approached from the darkness, and Rob  fainted. The last words he heard were, \"God dammit, Rob!\"\n\nRob woke up yet again, but this time in a well conditioned room. The room was illuminated with light this time, and the was a working air conditioner. General Waller approached Rob.\n\n\"We saw that you have 42 hours put into the game No Man's Sky. Is this true?\"\n\nRob was confused. \"Wha.. Wha.. Uhh..\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I should introduce myself. My name is General Waller, part of the U.S. Armed Forces. No Man's Sky was a test made by our scientists to determine who was capable of enduring extended periods of boredom before succumbing to insanity. You have put the most time into the game, an astounding *42 hours* straight. Our test results show you are capable of surviving 20 years of boredom, double the amount of time needed to make the trip to another galaxy.\"\n\nRob took a long time to understand what the general was saying. After a long silence, he said, \"Uhh.. ok?\"\n\nGeneral Waller's eyes brightened, and he exclaimed, \"Great! You will be leaving in roughly 2 hours.\"\n\n\"Wait, what about my friends and family? Don't I get to say goodbye?\"\n\n\"Nah, too heartbreaking. Besides, you barely interacted with them.

Let us not fight it out with our enemies! Instead, let us do the opposite.\"\n\n\"I've tried turning their cheeks and whipping that side, Jesus.

Like many times before, I had chosen a direction in random, set my ship to hyperdrive, and flew in a straight line until I found myself face to face with another planet to explore.\n\nIt had been years since the initial release of No Man\u2019s Sky. The Internet had buzzed with excitement for many months beforehand, only for many to disappointed with the shallow breadth of the game. For a while, it had done well. Thousands of gamers had preordered the game, and many more found themselves purchasing it regardless of its mediocre reviews. Within a year however, its player base had dropped considerably. Hello Games, in an effort to revitalize their creation, added more and more features as the months passed -- cities, more alien races, and many secrets not revealed to the public. But after the first few years they had came to a sad conclusion: No Man\u2019s Sky was simply not the cash cow they had hoped for.\n\nThat is not to say it became an unplayed game. A small but dedicated group of fans, myself included, continued to play the game religiously, more and more satisfied with each new patch. And so here I was, years later, still exploring the vast universe that had been created for us.\n\nIn the distance, a speck of blue slowly grew larger and larger in my monitor. Snapping back to attention, I slowed the acceleration on my ship as I approached the looming planet. Compared to the countless other planets I had explored, it seemed unexceptional. A planet composed of mostly water, with a few green continents. Shrugging, I scanned the planet. According to my on ship computer, it had already been discovered and named 'Earth' by a fellow player. I chuckled to myself at the uncreative alias.\n\nSlowing my ship even further, I began to circle the planet, searching for an interesting area to land. As my eyes scanned the various landmasses, I felt my heart begin to beat faster. It all seemed so\u2026 familiar. There! That landmass looked just like Australia, and below that, Antarctica. Circling the planet completely, I had recognized each and every continent. I laughed nervously to myself. It must have been an easter egg added by Hello Games years ago. It was the only logical explanation.\n\nDipping the nose of my aircraft, I approached the surface of the planet. Circling closer and closer towards the United States, I watched as more and more familiar details filled my window. The Rocky Mountains, the Mississippi River, all the major landmarks were accounted for. Perhaps even more peculiar, I could see the outlines of skyscrapers, exactly where major cities were supposed to be.\n\nMy hands shook as I approached downtown Seattle. Below me, I could just make out the occasional life form walking along the dimly lit streets. Just like in reality, it was the dead of night. In the distance, I recognized the Space Needle, not so far from my apartment.\n\nHolding my breath, I quickly located and landed on the roof of my apartment building. Immediately after my character exited his space craft, I walked over and peered over the edge of the high rise. On the streets, individuals walked along under the night sky. Each neighboring building was accounted for, the same ones I walked past each and every day.\n\nEntering the building through the roof, my character descended the staircase towards the 15th floor, my floor. By this point I was dizzy with anticipation and fear. Slowly, surely, I approached room 1518. My avatar reached towards the old, bronze knocker bolted to the oak paneling on my door. I hesitated for a moment, gathering my wits, before I hit the Interact button.

Then everything went to black.   \n\n"], [8, "My heart quickened as I approached the planet mirroring my own. My eyes must have been deceiving me, no doubt. I entered into Earth's orbit, and as I did, the satellites and space junk came into view. Was it possible? Normally there would be space debris such as asteroids or ice, but the satellites were unmistakeable in shape and detail.\n\nThe detail. There was something ominous about it. I couldn't quite place it, but it was unsettling, to say the least. My sweaty hands clenched the controller tighter, my joints and knuckles cracking after 4 hours of uninterrupted gameplay. I rolled my neck around and took the moment to stretch as my spacecraft was entering into the planet's atmosphere. Sure enough, the iconic continental outlines appeared into my view as I attempted to slow my descent. It was incredible: I had perhaps been the only player to find our home planet. Does that mean the game is based on actual scientific information of the universe?\n\nMy curiosity got the better of me, and since I had spent hours on Google Maps before I figured it would be similar on No Man's Sky. I explored the Earth in it's entirety, stopping by my favorite spots first. I visited Paris, and sure enough, the Eiffel Tower emerged in view with its towering peak swaying realistically with the wind conditions I was facing. The rust appearing on the metal as I came dangerously close seemed too good to be true. I was internally applauding the game developers for how much thought they had put into the game. I parked my ship in the nearest open field and just admired the scenery. In the distance, I saw the Louvre and imagined myself touring it with the unmistakable masterpieces inside. Perhaps I could see the Mona Lisa, or Faith Ringgold's quilt picturing the Louvre itself? \n\nAs I was lost in thought a small movement caught my eye on the screen. It was a person walking by my ship. As it moved past I saw it pull out a small device (most likely a cell phone). I had decided it was probably time for me to go. I may receive a Wanted level and the sentinels would be on my ass. \n\nI departed from my dream city, and had a small cringey realization that I was having the most basic fantasies for travel that a person could possibly have. The number of people who dreamed of Paris was too high for me to take my dreams seriously.\n\nI then decided to do the unbelievable: visit my own house. As every Google Maps user can attest, seeing your own house in another medium has some unknown appeal, perhaps a meta-feeling one cannot shake. I travelled to the small town in Oregon, my home city that I had grown up in. Incredibly, there was the banner hung downtown in all its glory; the updated version hung up merely 2 months prior. The detail, as I've said before, was eerie. \n\nSweeping down the Main Street, I took my time and took in the sights. I could easily travel downtown myself but I'm too much of a geek to be seen in sunlight. My skin might burn, and then my YouTube let's play's would be marred with my malformation. \n\nI swept past the Dairy Queen and iconic antique shop that my grandmother spent so much time at. I bulldozed my way through traffic and was amazed once again at the realistic NPC's driving along the roads. As my street came into view, I took a pause. There was a noise coming from the game.\n\nOr was it the game?\n\nWas it outside?\n\nI couldn't identify it.\n\nI hadn't left the washing machine on.\n\nWhat on Earth?\n\nI glanced out the window and saw what I can only describe as a machine; a machine that directly paralleled my spacecraft in the game.\n\nThe game had come to life. \n\nAs I caught my breath, my hands started to shake. Nothing made sense at the moment and I was convinced the entire occurrence was a hallucination. Yes, that's what it was. A hallucination brought on by the massive amounts of Doritos and Mountain Dew I had consumed that afternoon. I shook my head and decided to test it. I moved my craft in the game forward, and the humming noise of the engine grew louder. As expected, the ship was directly outside my house. I felt a nauseating feeling swell up inside of me. How was this possible? What was I supposed to do? Do other people know about this? Should I go public with this knowledge? Was No Man's Sky a development brought by NASA to explore space deeper? \n\nSuddenly, the game crashed. The loading screen was broken and my moniter exploded, shooting debris straight through the empty Mountain Dew cans. \n\nA knock came from my bedroom door.\n\n\"Mark Diamond? Please open the door.

I chuckled to myself at the uncreative alias.\n\nSlowing my ship even further, I began to circle the planet, searching for an interesting area to land. As my eyes scanned the various landmasses, I felt my heart begin to beat faster. It all seemed so\u2026 familiar. There! That landmass looked just like Australia, and below that, Antarctica. Circling the planet completely, I had recognized each and every continent. I laughed nervously to myself. It must have been an easter egg added by Hello Games years ago. It was the only logical explanation.\n\nDipping the nose of my aircraft, I approached the surface of the planet. Circling closer and closer towards the United States, I watched as more and more familiar details filled my window. The Rocky Mountains, the Mississippi River, all the major landmarks were accounted for. Perhaps even more peculiar, I could see the outlines of skyscrapers, exactly where major cities were supposed to be.\n\nMy hands shook as I approached downtown Seattle. Below me, I could just make out the occasional life form walking along the dimly lit streets. Just like in reality, it was the dead of night. In the distance, I recognized the Space Needle, not so far from my apartment.\n\nHolding my breath, I quickly located and landed on the roof of my apartment building. Immediately after my character exited his space craft, I walked over and peered over the edge of the high rise. On the streets, individuals walked along under the night sky. Each neighboring building was accounted for, the same ones I walked past each and every day.\n\nEntering the building through the roof, my character descended the staircase towards the 15th floor, my floor. By this point I was dizzy with anticipation and fear. Slowly, surely, I approached room 1518. My avatar reached towards the old, bronze knocker bolted to the oak paneling on my door. I hesitated for a moment, gathering my wits, before I hit the Interact button.

My eyes must have been deceiving me, no doubt. I entered into Earth's orbit, and as I did, the satellites and space junk came into view. Was it possible? Normally there would be space debris such as asteroids or ice, but the satellites were unmistakeable in shape and detail.\n\nThe detail. There was something ominous about it. I couldn't quite place it, but it was unsettling, to say the least. My sweaty hands clenched the controller tighter, my joints and knuckles cracking after 4 hours of uninterrupted gameplay. I rolled my neck around and took the moment to stretch as my spacecraft was entering into the planet's atmosphere. Sure enough, the iconic continental outlines appeared into my view as I attempted to slow my descent. It was incredible: I had perhaps been the only player to find our home planet. Does that mean the game is based on actual scientific information of the universe?\n\nMy curiosity got the better of me, and since I had spent hours on Google Maps before I figured it would be similar on No Man's Sky. I explored the Earth in it's entirety, stopping by my favorite spots first. I visited Paris, and sure enough, the Eiffel Tower emerged in view with its towering peak swaying realistically with the wind conditions I was facing. The rust appearing on the metal as I came dangerously close seemed too good to be true. I was internally applauding the game developers for how much thought they had put into the game. I parked my ship in the nearest open field and just admired the scenery. In the distance, I saw the Louvre and imagined myself touring it with the unmistakable masterpieces inside. Perhaps I could see the Mona Lisa, or Faith Ringgold's quilt picturing the Louvre itself? \n\nAs I was lost in thought a small movement caught my eye on the screen. It was a person walking by my ship. As it moved past I saw it pull out a small device (most likely a cell phone). I had decided it was probably time for me to go. I may receive a Wanted level and the sentinels would be on my ass. \n\nI departed from my dream city, and had a small cringey realization that I was having the most basic fantasies for travel that a person could possibly have. The number of people who dreamed of Paris was too high for me to take my dreams seriously.\n\nI then decided to do the unbelievable: visit my own house. As every Google Maps user can attest, seeing your own house in another medium has some unknown appeal, perhaps a meta-feeling one cannot shake. I travelled to the small town in Oregon, my home city that I had grown up in. Incredibly, there was the banner hung downtown in all its glory; the updated version hung up merely 2 months prior. The detail, as I've said before, was eerie. \n\nSweeping down the Main Street, I took my time and took in the sights. I could easily travel downtown myself but I'm too much of a geek to be seen in sunlight. My skin might burn, and then my YouTube let's play's would be marred with my malformation. \n\nI swept past the Dairy Queen and iconic antique shop that my grandmother spent so much time at. I bulldozed my way through traffic and was amazed once again at the realistic NPC's driving along the roads. As my street came into view, I took a pause. There was a noise coming from the game.\n\nOr was it the game?\n\nWas it outside?\n\nI couldn't identify it.\n\nI hadn't left the washing machine on.\n\nWhat on Earth?\n\nI glanced out the window and saw what I can only describe as a machine; a machine that directly paralleled my spacecraft in the game.\n\nThe game had come to life. \n\nAs I caught my breath, my hands started to shake. Nothing made sense at the moment and I was convinced the entire occurrence was a hallucination. Yes, that's what it was. A hallucination brought on by the massive amounts of Doritos and Mountain Dew I had consumed that afternoon. I shook my head and decided to test it. I moved my craft in the game forward, and the humming noise of the engine grew louder. As expected, the ship was directly outside my house. I felt a nauseating feeling swell up inside of me. How was this possible? What was I supposed to do? Do other people know about this? Should I go public with this knowledge? Was No Man's Sky a development brought by NASA to explore space deeper? \n\nSuddenly, the game crashed. The loading screen was broken and my moniter exploded, shooting debris straight through the empty Mountain Dew cans. \n\nA knock came from my bedroom door.\n\n\"Mark Diamond? Please open the door.

It's eyes glowed a savage black and red, the shadows revealing the tiny claws, and the heavy sounds of traffic being overshadowed by a constant chittering sound.\n\nTodd looked down past the mugger. The mugger looked behind himself and turned around. He barely let out a cry as the furry beast lunged at him with all its might, unleashing a rabid rage against the man who dared lay a hand on the average Joe who saved it. A Tarantino-esque spectacle was unfolding, the knife thrown away by the squirrel; Todd simply backed away in fear.  The squirrel, a furry blur, bit, scratched, and kicked, spraying blood wherever possible with its sharp claws. And then it was gone.\n\nThe mugger stood back up, the squirrel having disappeared as quickly as it arrived. Blood streaked his face, his eyelids a floppy ruin, shredded cheeks, a nose with big tears going through it.

All that nut-burying - that's forward planning. \n\nNo one makes these criticisms about Lassie. Everyone just accepts that one. \n\nNo, dogs can't climb trees. That makes squirrels smarter.

As the seconds flicked buy I eagerly checked my watch as I crammed down today's Full English Breakfast. What's weird is that nothing seemed out of the ordinary that day, well, this was my first time travelling by air on \"business\" but an airport is an airport - everyone looks either very stressed or very relaxed depending on the circumstances of their flight. I was the former. Television screens dotted around the waiting room showed live footage of the airport that I was sitting in; one of America's newest and popular politicians was also making a flight today from an adjacent terminal to mine. Watching the TV crew opposite the canteen interviewing said politician, and then casting my eyes to the TV mounted on the wall opposite me kept me amused for most of the morning as I played a game with myself to catch the delay on the live news coverage. Was it 5 seconds, or 7? I couldn't remember.\n\nThen \"it\" happened\".\n\nA flash of white light cracked to the right of my peripheral vision, exactly where the TV crew was standing. Chairs and hand luggage littered the air as I was thrown across the canteen floor, my breakfast joining the chairs in it's flight path to any wall or ceiling it would collide with first.

I won't lie, I started to cry and blubber immediately whilst I begged for my life. Pulling me by my forearm he dragged me to where the politician stood in the center of the airport waiting room. Other men circled the remaining living bodies into a group.

Then, I blinked and his rifle was gone, knocked from his hands.A brown blur.

It would silently dart from nowhere, and once it's work was done it left behind nothing but a little sonic \"pop\" from its speed as it vanished. Soon this mini hero began taunting them.

An acorn.\n\t\nJesus Christ, and that little fucker's crawling up her dress then he jumps onto the altar. And he turns to her and, no shit, he holds the nut out to her. Like a wedding gift!\n\t\nI'm too shell shocked to do much. 'Cause in my head this is the squirrel I supposedly 'risked lives' to not hit. And i still think it was him. It had that bit of gray in his tail. So I'm not even looking at Shirley.\n\t\nFinally I see her move. She's been creepin' while I stare at the critter so I didn't see her take her shoe off.\n\t\nAnd the poor little guy is lookin' at her like she's a queen. And she takes that white goddamn shoe and just - I've never seen her move like that she was like fuckin' Bruce Lee - she just fuckin' crushes him with it.\n\t\nI broke it off after that.

The mugger looked behind himself and turned around.

And then it was gone.\n\nThe mugger stood back up, the squirrel having disappeared as quickly as it arrived. Blood streaked his face, his eyelids a floppy ruin, shredded cheeks, a nose with big tears going through it.

There I was, facing down this gigantic robot, and suddenly this squirrel rocks up.\n\nYeah, a squirrel. \n\nYou remember, I saved a squirrel's life like, three years ago. \n\nYeah, swerved into a ditch. Cost a fortune to fix the car - we checked later, and it would have been more economical to scrap it and get a new one. \n\nThe way I see it, the squirrel thought he owed me, and turned up in my hour of need.\n\nI mean, they have to be a bit smart. All that nut-burying - that's forward planning. \n\nNo one makes these criticisms about Lassie. Everyone just accepts that one. \n\nNo, dogs can't climb trees. That makes squirrels smarter. And they've got bigger tails, relative to their size.\n\nI don't know, do I? I'm not a squirrel biologist. I just thought it might be important. \n\nI'm telling you, that's what I think happened. I saved a squirrel, and it tried to repay. Nothing else fits the facts.\n\nAnyway, so there I am. The robot - you must have seen it - it's about eight storeys tall, right, with whirling axe blades instead of hands and, like, laser beams. Just shooting out of its eyes - like \"pew pew\" and a bus blows up. Crazy shit.\n\nI don't know who made it. I'm not a robot biologist either. \n\nOr a robot psychologist. I don't know what it wanted. \n\nOf course it was irresponsible - what kind of nutter releases a death robot during a parade?\n\nNo, I can have an opinion of the guy without knowing who it is. \n\nI don't know!

There I am, standing in front of this killer robot, and I am absolutely bricking it. And he's loo-\n\nI'm not a coward. Anyone would have been scared. \n\nNo you wouldn't. Because Taekwondo is bullshit, for one thing, and because you aren't even a yellow belt yet. \n\nIt would have crushed you. With its massive metal feet. \n\nYeah, you would definitely have done that.

It's not part of the story.\n\nJust forget it, okay? I didn't die then, so it doesn't matter. We don't need to talk about it. \n\nI cannot believe you would accuse me of that. My best mate, thinking I'd sink that low. \n\nI'm not even going to dignify that with a response. \n\nSo the laser beams are charging up, and I've got my whole life flashing before my eyes.

I was just joking!\n\nGod, you're a bit touchy. \n\nRight, yeah. So this squirrel. it just comes out of nowhere. One minute I'm ready to die, and then there's this furry blur charging the robot. \n\nAnd the robot is like a billion times the size of it, and for a few seconds, it doesn't even notice. And I'm just standing there, watching this furry ball of rage charge a robot to save me. It was epic. \n\nIt was like chittering, sort-of high-pitched rage noises. \n\nThen it gets within about ten metres of the giant robot and it just leaps. Straight off the ground, like ten feet upwards, still moving forwards. \n\nIt was the bravest thing I've ever seen. Just charging an unstoppable death machine, for me. You know, like the courage you'd need to do that. Mad respect to squirrels, I'm telling you. I will never underestimate their bravery again. \n\nWhat? \n\nOh, it died. \n\nYeah, got drop-kicked into a building by a foot the size of a truck. What did you think was going to happen? \n\nUh, it was a squirrel, fighting a robot with saws for hands. That's not even a competition. \n\nWell of course it would be great if it had won. But it didn't. That's ridiculous. \n\nHow would it even hurt it? It can't bite through titanium or whatever. \n\nI'm not saying it wasn't brave! I was very clear on that. I even said it was incredible. It just didn't work. \n\nBecause this is the real world, not bullshit-Taekwondo fantasy wonderland where squirrels are ninjas. \n\nBut it wasn't a magic squirrel.

As the seconds flicked buy I eagerly checked my watch as I crammed down today's Full English Breakfast. What's weird is that nothing seemed out of the ordinary that day, well, this was my first time travelling by air on \"business\" but an airport is an airport - everyone looks either very stressed or very relaxed depending on the circumstances of their flight. I was the former. Television screens dotted around the waiting room showed live footage of the airport that I was sitting in; one of America's newest and popular politicians was also making a flight today from an adjacent terminal to mine. Watching the TV crew opposite the canteen interviewing said politician, and then casting my eyes to the TV mounted on the wall opposite me kept me amused for most of the morning as I played a game with myself to catch the delay on the live news coverage. Was it 5 seconds, or 7? I couldn't remember.\n\nThen \"it\" happened\".\n\nA flash of white light cracked to the right of my peripheral vision, exactly where the TV crew was standing. Chairs and hand luggage littered the air as I was thrown across the canteen floor, my breakfast joining the chairs in it's flight path to any wall or ceiling it would collide with first.

I won't lie, I started to cry and blubber immediately whilst I begged for my life. Pulling me by my forearm he dragged me to where the politician stood in the center of the airport waiting room. Other men circled the remaining living bodies into a group.

Zeeeeeeee-----thwack. Dummmmmm.*\n\nAmong the terrorists shouting orders at people crawling on the floor, the strange noises that I could faintly hear grew in volume and frequency. \n\nTo the left.

Collectively I think everyone assumed that these were the noises of special forces preparing to counter-attack. I don't think any of us could've guessed that those noises were being made by a super-sonic squirrel.\n\nGun shots. An armed man bent over himself, winded from the impact of... something. The pain caused him to clench the rifle gripped in his hand and fire off rounds.\nScreams, another, spinning around shooting at the roof rafters.\n\n\"What is it, what is it!!!\" screamed the man that had thrust his rifle into my forehead seconds earlier. Then, I blinked and his rifle was gone, knocked from his hands.A brown blur. An acorn appeared in mid-air and dropped in its wale.\n\nWe all stood gobsmacked as this, thing, picked them off one by one. It would silently dart from nowhere, and once it's work was done it left behind nothing but a little sonic \"pop\" from its speed as it vanished. Soon this mini hero began taunting them. Aiming for the crotch, the neck, the legs. Anything to make them keel over and cry for mercy.... all broadcast on Live Television.

I mean, Jesus Christ, it's a fucking peace sign. We've got assholes roaming around with Confederate flags and bible verses plastered onto their minivans - I'm sorry. I'm gonna leave the the little bit of positiveness I'm able to bring to the world. I don't care if she thinks it looks 'gay' or whatever.**\n\t\nI dunno it was weird. I never swerve to avoid animals. I mean it's the first thing they teach you. Don't brake hard, don't swerve. Just hit 'em. Better them than you. I mean, you remember that raccon. \n\t\nWell for whatever reason, I DID swerve. And when I checked the rearview...Okay. This is dumb, but...I knew the thing was thankful. I knew the thing was gonna go home to its little squirrel wife or little squirrel husband and its little squirrel kids and it was gonna cry and hug them as hard as it could with its little squirrel hands.\n\t\nShirl was pissed. She almost broke up with me that day, two weeks from our wedding and she wanted to break it off because I swerved to miss a fuckin' squirrel. She'd been bitching about the sticker all day but the squirrel pushed her into another level. By the time we got home she was screamin' and slammin' doors and all that. \n\t\nI told her I was tired and I pretended to take a nap. I just don't do good with that stuff.\n\t\nAnyway. Couple weeks later, time to get hitched. We're in the hall at the Dogwood Castle. \n\t\nI mean, it looks like a castle, but it's real small. Like a cottage made out of stone.\n\t\nAnd we're saying our vows. And mine were all short and I didn't talk very loud but I was nervous and that doesn't mean I didn't mean 'em, 'cause I did. I just get nervous. Even though it's only like forty people I get nervous.\n\t\nShirley finishes hers and, I dunno, they sound like she had someone write them for her. Like it has words she never uses, you know? And the rent-a-priest is finishing up and I swear to God. In comes the squirrel from the bumper sticker day. And he's got a little nut in his hands. An acorn.\n\t\nJesus Christ, and that little fucker's crawling up her dress then he jumps onto the altar. And he turns to her and, no shit, he holds the nut out to her. Like a wedding gift!\n\t\nI'm too shell shocked to do much. 'Cause in my head this is the squirrel I supposedly 'risked lives' to not hit. And i still think it was him. It had that bit of gray in his tail. So I'm not even looking at Shirley.\n\t\nFinally I see her move. She's been creepin' while I stare at the critter so I didn't see her take her shoe off.\n\t\nAnd the poor little guy is lookin' at her like she's a queen. And she takes that white goddamn shoe and just - I've never seen her move like that she was like fuckin' Bruce Lee - she just fuckin' crushes him with it.\n\t\nI broke it off after that.

Nobody even fired a round, then!  And is it a big surprise that Murder Dog is white?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but be fair,\u201d Firebolt turned to Riddle.  \u201cShooting Murder Dog\u2019s not going to stop him.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, true. But they didn\u2019t even try.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but what happened next?\u201d Jasper asked.  \u201cQualm showed up, saved the day and everyone thanked her and she went on to do a week of interviews.  There was no racism, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d said Riddle.  \u201cLike anyone\u2019s going to get mad at Qualm.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m just saying,\u201d Jasper raised his armor defensively.\n\n\u201cWhat about Gwardian?  He died in police custody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re just being a fucking idiot,\u201d Riddle clawed his way across the ceiling, away from the conversation.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to destroy stuff,\u201d Firebolt called out, \u201cgo to the training room, please!\u201d\n", "id": "czrckio"}]]], "435qk1": ["[EU] Eager to learn through your ancestors how to fight oppressive organisations, you hop into an ANIMUS.

I live in the United States of America. I don't know if anyone will read this, in fact, it would be best if no one did. If I'm forced to keep this bottled up though, it may kill me. \n\nThis story really starts about fifty years ago. There was a massive change in the political make up of the country. Previous political parties fell, cannibalized by their own members. What emerged from the wreckage seemed like a step forward. Initially there was several new parties, though that didn't last. They all coalesced into two main parties: the Libertarian Party, and the Social Justice Party. Sadly, it quickly devolved into the same old partisan bickering that had plagued us before the shift. \n\nAfter twenty years of even more intense political battles, it seemed our country was on the brink of another Civil War. Then she came along. Jessica Lewis was the daughter of then Frito-Lay CEO Franklin Lewis. She was a rising star in the Social Justice Party, frequently at odds with her father and his company. Franklin was a strong supporter of the Libertarian Party and close friends with President Harken. None of this was particularly noteworthy until the Amtrak Incident. \n\nIt was late July, and the general election was just kicking off after a fierce primary on the Social Justice side. President Harken was traveling up to New York with Franklin Lewis on a campaign stop for his second term. A fringe leftist group, Justice Now, had planted explosives on the train. The outcry was enormous, and then Vice President Walters handily won the election. Using Amtrak as a call to arms he waged a massive campaign against leftist ideologies, even imprisoning many key figures of the Social Justice Party on trumped up charges of conspiracy. Jessica Lewis only managed to avoid the same fate by taking up the CEO position at Frito-Lay and seemingly adopting a more Libertarian philosophy. \n\nThe next election year was widely considered a farce at first, though few would say it openly for fear of reprisal. Then Jessica joined the race on the Social Justice side. Through her father's connections and her time as Frito-Lay CEO, President Walters must have seen her as moderate enough to let run. That was a big mistake on his part. Jessica won with a surprising number of votes given how scared people were of getting on the wrong side of President Walters, or perhaps that was the reason. It doesn't matter anymore of course, she became President and that's when it all went to shit. \n\nTurns out Jessica wasn't nearly as moderate as she'd let Walters believe. After being sworn in she launched the largest investigation into a previous President that had ever been seen. It's hard to know how much of what she found was true, and how much was fabricated to suit her agenda. Nobody expected what happened next, and she was cunning and ruthless in her execution. First she went after former President Walters and a core group of Libertarians for perpetrating the Amtrak Incident and blaming it on leftists and using it against them. \n\nBy the time the Social Justice Party realized she had turned on them as well it was too late. People tried to rationalize her behavior at first, and tried to convince her to change her mind. She was raised in the household of an influential CEO, but she knew they were wrong in their ways. That's what they told themselves, and her. They were wrong. She was incredibly sociopathic, telling everyone just what they wanted to hear, until she came to power. \n\nOver the next thirty years she abolished both political parties and formed her own: the Unification Party. While other political parties weren't strictly outlawed, few were dumb enough to try, and those who did disappeared. She enshrined protection for minority sexualities in the constitution, now easily amendable by herself alone. Fat shaming was explicitly outlawed, which coupled with the institution of Frito-Lay as the official corporation of government led to an even more obese population. Eventually she even abolished gender, replacing it instead with her own twisted system. \n\nThis is where my story begins. My name is James, and I live in the United States of America.

Bastard has already learned everyones name. This guy is good. I take the chair in my office and ponder what his reaction is going to be when I call him out? Will he react poorly? Try to start a fight? or will he realize that this isn't the place for him and take off? I really hope it is the latter. I can't deal with something like this at the current time. I just hope he doesn't make a big deal out of it and go to the boss if he doesn't want to leave on his own.\n\nDerek walks in with that same big smile plastered across his face, he is still mid-conversation with someone outside my office, but quickly tells them he will be right back. He hurriedly shuts the door and turns to face me, the large smile quickly fades into a blank expression. Without even waiting for me to offer, Derek takes the seat opposite my desk. This is how it's going to be huh? I may enjoy this I think to myself.\n\n\"So, Derek. The reason I call\"\n\n\"Cut the shit,\" Derek chimes in, cutting me off mid-sentence.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I respond a little baffled.\n\n\"I said to cut the shit,\" Derek repeats, his words dripping confidence. \"I know why you called me in here. It's because of this right?\" Derek points up at where the number 10 floats above his head.\n\n\"Uh.. Yeah, but how do you know about it?\" I say, truly a little taken back for the first time ever. \"I thought I was the only one who could do that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" He says smugly, \"A lot of people can see them. We can't see our own, this is true, but I happen to know mine. Would you like to know what yours is?\" Derek says, somehow finding a way to fit more narcissism into the words.\n\nI lean back into my chair and lock my fingers together, I try very hard not to smile back at Derek. I can tell by the smug little smile thats spreading across his face that he thinks he has the upper-hand. He thinks he is scaring me. \"Nope.\" I simply state.\n\nDerek looks a little confused at my response. \"Nope?... Uh, are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm sure. I don't need to know. I actually have no interest in knowing.\" I say back. I can tell that Derek wears his number as a badge of honor. That his entire being evolves around knowing that he is a 10. I decide to go in for the kill.\n\n\"I can tell that you take pride in your number, I can also tell by your response that you've been around a lot of other people with high numbers too, right?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah actually,\" Derek says with almost no trace of the narcissism present in his voice this time, \"I have a club where a lot of us higher digits go to hang out and tell stories.\" The look of confusion leaves his face now, but I can see that smugness returning as he says, \"You're no 10, but I think you should come by. We would always welcome a\"\n\n\"I said no, Derek,\" I cut him off before he says my number out loud, \"See, the thing is. I've been around a shit ton of high rated people too. Now I can't say that I've ever met anyone over a 7 in person before, but I have done quite a bit of extensive research on the numbers. There are extensive materials out there on the subject if you know where to look, and between my research and personal experience, I just want to ask you something?\"\n\n\"Okay...\" Derek says sheepishly.\n\n\"Do you even know what they are about Derek? I mean, I know as well as you do that the numbers are a scale that represent the individuals danger level. But do you know the difference after you hit 7? For instance, the difference between, say a 7 and a 10?\" \n\nDerek looks around with a confused expression before responding. \"I really can't say that I do know.. What is it?\"\n\n\"Ah, thank you for asking. Well, Derek, as we know, a 7 is a trained assassin. Numbers 1-7 represent the inviduals physical prowess, the effectiveness of his combat training, combat capabilities, et cetera.\"\n\nDerek looks at me with a look that says \"No shit\", and begins to say something.\n\n\"BUT!,\" I cut him off before he even speaks, \"But, 7 and up have nothing to do with any of that at this point.\"\n\nDerek sits with his mouth wide open and a look like he is about to protest. \n\n\"Hear me out Derek, this will make sense. A 7 is considered to be an extremely well trained assassin. An 8, some would say, would be the epitome of the perfect assassin on a purely physical scale. Its the difference between a 9 and a 10 that make the biggest differences.\" I pause to make sure he catches the full meaning.\n\n\"How so?\" He says eventually.\n\n\"Well Derek, after rank 7, or really in my opinion rank 8, a person has achieved damn near perfection on the threat level. They have mastered physical combat and are well equipped to handle any confrontation. After that though, it all boils down to psyche. See what most people don't know is that the higher you are, you become full blown psychopaths. A rank 10 feels no fear, they don't hesitate to kill, say women and children, they don't recognize that they are in danger and like to Rambo it everywhere they go. Quite frankly, 10's are egotistical assholes who aren't smart enough to realize that fear is a tool as well as a weapon.\" As I'm speaking I watch Derek's face turn to anger.\n\n\"Are you fucking insulting me?\" Derek yells as he hops up out of my chair, I see him reaching into his jacket.\n\n\"Uh, yes, I am.

Bastard has already learned everyones name. This guy is good. I take the chair in my office and ponder what his reaction is going to be when I call him out? Will he react poorly? Try to start a fight? or will he realize that this isn't the place for him and take off? I really hope it is the latter. I can't deal with something like this at the current time. I just hope he doesn't make a big deal out of it and go to the boss if he doesn't want to leave on his own.\n\nDerek walks in with that same big smile plastered across his face, he is still mid-conversation with someone outside my office, but quickly tells them he will be right back. He hurriedly shuts the door and turns to face me, the large smile quickly fades into a blank expression. Without even waiting for me to offer, Derek takes the seat opposite my desk. This is how it's going to be huh? I may enjoy this I think to myself.\n\n\"So, Derek. The reason I call\"\n\n\"Cut the shit,\" Derek chimes in, cutting me off mid-sentence.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I respond a little baffled.\n\n\"I said to cut the shit,\" Derek repeats, his words dripping confidence. \"I know why you called me in here. It's because of this right?\" Derek points up at where the number 10 floats above his head.\n\n\"Uh.. Yeah, but how do you know about it?\" I say, truly a little taken back for the first time ever. \"I thought I was the only one who could do that?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" He says smugly, \"A lot of people can see them. We can't see our own, this is true, but I happen to know mine. Would you like to know what yours is?\" Derek says, somehow finding a way to fit more narcissism into the words.\n\nI lean back into my chair and lock my fingers together, I try very hard not to smile back at Derek. I can tell by the smug little smile thats spreading across his face that he thinks he has the upper-hand. He thinks he is scaring me. \"Nope.\" I simply state.\n\nDerek looks a little confused at my response. \"Nope?... Uh, are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm sure. I don't need to know. I actually have no interest in knowing.\" I say back. I can tell that Derek wears his number as a badge of honor. That his entire being evolves around knowing that he is a 10. I decide to go in for the kill.\n\n\"I can tell that you take pride in your number, I can also tell by your response that you've been around a lot of other people with high numbers too, right?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah actually,\" Derek says with almost no trace of the narcissism present in his voice this time, \"I have a club where a lot of us higher digits go to hang out and tell stories.\" The look of confusion leaves his face now, but I can see that smugness returning as he says, \"You're no 10, but I think you should come by. We would always welcome a\"\n\n\"I said no, Derek,\" I cut him off before he says my number out loud, \"See, the thing is. I've been around a shit ton of high rated people too. Now I can't say that I've ever met anyone over a 7 in person before, but I have done quite a bit of extensive research on the numbers. There are extensive materials out there on the subject if you know where to look, and between my research and personal experience, I just want to ask you something?\"\n\n\"Okay...\" Derek says sheepishly.\n\n\"Do you even know what they are about Derek? I mean, I know as well as you do that the numbers are a scale that represent the individuals danger level. But do you know the difference after you hit 7? For instance, the difference between, say a 7 and a 10?\" \n\nDerek looks around with a confused expression before responding. \"I really can't say that I do know.. What is it?\"\n\n\"Ah, thank you for asking. Well, Derek, as we know, a 7 is a trained assassin. Numbers 1-7 represent the inviduals physical prowess, the effectiveness of his combat training, combat capabilities, et cetera.\"\n\nDerek looks at me with a look that says \"No shit\", and begins to say something.\n\n\"BUT!,\" I cut him off before he even speaks, \"But, 7 and up have nothing to do with any of that at this point.\"\n\nDerek sits with his mouth wide open and a look like he is about to protest. \n\n\"Hear me out Derek, this will make sense. A 7 is considered to be an extremely well trained assassin. An 8, some would say, would be the epitome of the perfect assassin on a purely physical scale. Its the difference between a 9 and a 10 that make the biggest differences.\" I pause to make sure he catches the full meaning.\n\n\"How so?\" He says eventually.\n\n\"Well Derek, after rank 7, or really in my opinion rank 8, a person has achieved damn near perfection on the threat level. They have mastered physical combat and are well equipped to handle any confrontation. After that though, it all boils down to psyche. See what most people don't know is that the higher you are, you become full blown psychopaths. A rank 10 feels no fear, they don't hesitate to kill, say women and children, they don't recognize that they are in danger and like to Rambo it everywhere they go. Quite frankly, 10's are egotistical assholes who aren't smart enough to realize that fear is a tool as well as a weapon.\" As I'm speaking I watch Derek's face turn to anger.\n\n\"Are you fucking insulting me?\" Derek yells as he hops up out of my chair, I see him reaching into his jacket.\n\n\"Uh, yes, I am. The thing about you 10's is that you think you have mastered all there is to know about combat, you think you are the biggest threat to everyone and everything around you. What you fail to recognize is that after rank 9, a 10 marks himself as being a danger to himself as well.

This is your girlfriends dad. Stay away from my daughter. Also, lets do butt stuff.\"\n\nI called for my girlfriend in the other room. Gertrude was a true renaissance woman -- a porn star by trade, but a welder in spirit. She had just finished her shift at the sawmill. Moving logs all day. Stiff, hard wood. \"Hi, boyfriend!\" Gertrude said. \"Can we make fuck?\", she inquired of me. \"Gertrude, there is something I need to talk to you about. Also yes, after we talk we can fuck.\". \"Okay, I just need to use the bathroom first\", said Gertrude.\n\n\"Use the bathroom?\" I asked, suspiciously. \"Yeah, I need to take a piss\", replied Gertrude. I sat on the couch for what must have been 8 minutes, stroking my thang intently. I knew something was wrong. I walked down the hall to the bathroom door and smelled it. I banged on the door with all my might and yelled \"Gertrude! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?\". She said \"I'm almost done babe, be right out!.\" I said \"YOUD BETTER NOT BE DOING WHAT I THINK YOUR DOING IN THERE! OPEN THIS GOD DAMNED DOOR.\"\n\n\"Cut it out psycho!\" Gertrude protested.  \"If you don't open this door right now, I'm going to barge in.\" Gertrude unlocked the door and I opened it. I saw her crouching over the toilet. I immediately threw her on to the floor and looked in to the bowl. Just as I suspected. There were four or five little balls of shit floating in the water. I looked around, and couldn't find any pets or other people in the bathroom. It must have been her. Gertrude was crying. \"Get out of this apartment. You disgust me!\". \"You're fucking crazy. I'm calling the police.\", Gertrude said. \"No need!\", I bellowed. \"I've already called them. What are you? Some kind of poop whore or something?\". \n\n\"Is that what this is all about?\", Gertrude asked seductively. \"Yes, I poop sometimes\", Gertrude continued. She slid her fingers in to her tuna box and started flicking her vag. \"But I do it for you, babe. I know how much you like making anal fucks with my shitpipe, but lube is expensive. I take the poops so that you can use the shit as lube.\"\n \n\"Oh baby, you'd do that for me?\". \"I'd do anything for you\". Gertrude took her fingers out of her vajango and stuck her fingers in her unwiped asshole. She got a good glob of shit together and rubbed her hands together. Then she took her shitty hands and started stroking my crooked dick. I looked down, at my ever growing shit caked cock. It was about 15 inches long. No big deal. Then she started jacking me off while she was sucking muh poopdick.\n\n\"NO!\" I yelled. I backhanded the fuck out of the fecal temptress. \"I won't become one with the brown side!\". I undid my pants and did the only thing that would cancel out the evil that had transpired here. I pressed my chocolate starfish to her mouth and unleashed a little shit of my own. She gagged on my pooplog while I twisted the shit out of her left nipple and popped her zits. My cock grew to about 22 inches long now. No big deal. \n\nI was ready. I turned around and nutted right in to her nostril. She snorted the cum greedily. We collapsed on the bathroom floor in post coital bliss. \"Now, you've given me a good time, but you still need to leave now. I won't be known to lay with poop whores.\" Before she went, I told her about the little conversation I had with her father.\n\n\"But jeff, my dad is kill?\" Gertrude said. \"But who was phone?\""]], [[{"comment": "Peter opened the door, which moaned softly as he touched the hard wood.

Also, lets do butt stuff.\"\n\nI called for my girlfriend in the other room. Gertrude was a true renaissance woman -- a porn star by trade, but a welder in spirit. She had just finished her shift at the sawmill. Moving logs all day. Stiff, hard wood. \"Hi, boyfriend!\" Gertrude said. \"Can we make fuck?\", she inquired of me. \"Gertrude, there is something I need to talk to you about. Also yes, after we talk we can fuck.\". \"Okay, I just need to use the bathroom first\", said Gertrude.\n\n\"Use the bathroom?\" I asked, suspiciously. \"Yeah, I need to take a piss\", replied Gertrude. I sat on the couch for what must have been 8 minutes, stroking my thang intently. I knew something was wrong. I walked down the hall to the bathroom door and smelled it. I banged on the door with all my might and yelled \"Gertrude! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?\". She said \"I'm almost done babe, be right out!.\" I said \"YOUD BETTER NOT BE DOING WHAT I THINK YOUR DOING IN THERE! OPEN THIS GOD DAMNED DOOR.\"\n\n\"Cut it out psycho!\" Gertrude protested.  \"If you don't open this door right now, I'm going to barge in.\" Gertrude unlocked the door and I opened it. I saw her crouching over the toilet. I immediately threw her on to the floor and looked in to the bowl. Just as I suspected. There were four or five little balls of shit floating in the water. I looked around, and couldn't find any pets or other people in the bathroom. It must have been her. Gertrude was crying. \"Get out of this apartment. You disgust me!\". \"You're fucking crazy. I'm calling the police.\", Gertrude said. \"No need!\", I bellowed. \"I've already called them. What are you? Some kind of poop whore or something?\". \n\n\"Is that what this is all about?\", Gertrude asked seductively. \"Yes, I poop sometimes\", Gertrude continued. She slid her fingers in to her tuna box and started flicking her vag. \"But I do it for you, babe. I know how much you like making anal fucks with my shitpipe, but lube is expensive. I take the poops so that you can use the shit as lube.\"\n \n\"Oh baby, you'd do that for me?\". \"I'd do anything for you\". Gertrude took her fingers out of her vajango and stuck her fingers in her unwiped asshole. She got a good glob of shit together and rubbed her hands together. Then she took her shitty hands and started stroking my crooked dick. I looked down, at my ever growing shit caked cock. It was about 15 inches long. No big deal. Then she started jacking me off while she was sucking muh poopdick.\n\n\"NO!\" I yelled. I backhanded the fuck out of the fecal temptress. \"I won't become one with the brown side!\". I undid my pants and did the only thing that would cancel out the evil that had transpired here. I pressed my chocolate starfish to her mouth and unleashed a little shit of my own. She gagged on my pooplog while I twisted the shit out of her left nipple and popped her zits. My cock grew to about 22 inches long now. No big deal. \n\nI was ready. I turned around and nutted right in to her nostril. She snorted the cum greedily. We collapsed on the bathroom floor in post coital bliss. \"Now, you've given me a good time, but you still need to leave now. I won't be known to lay with poop whores.\" Before she went, I told her about the little conversation I had with her father.\n\n\"But jeff, my dad is kill?\" Gertrude said. \"But who was phone?\"", "id": "cy8cmqb"}]]], "55k5ae": ["[WP] Your sitting in a cafe eating lunch when a well dressed business man comes up to you and says \"Your one demented, sick and twisted bitch.\" \"Thank you,\" you say and before you can return to your lunch in peace, he goes on. \"I need...someone taking care of and I was told you were hire.\"", "2016-10-03 00:42:07", 6, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/55k5ae/wp_your_sitting_in_a_cafe_eating_lunch_when_a/", [[1, "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n"], [5, "([Part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/55k7sb/wp_you_are_about_to_graduate_from_the_top/d8be1d0))\n\nI sat in the small cafe that had recently become my favorite, thanks to their \"eggs and bacon breakfast\" lunch special.

The crowd would have none of it. \n\nThen she became stern, admonishing them for their behavior, and the damage they were doing to the courtyard. \n\nAt this, the crowd began angry murmurings. Celestia's dismissive attitude igniting a fire in the heart of these downtrodden groundlings. The shouting broke out, and then the wordless, echoing roar of years of frustration poured out of thousands of throats. \n\nThen she made her worst mistake. Celestia threatened to call in the Royal Guards. \n\nBelow her were five thousand angry and iron-shod Earth ponies, strong from years of lifting and carrying and worked into a frothing frenzy by Mayor Mare's inciting speech. \n\nAnd she had approximately two hundred Royal Guards. \n\nAnd even that number can't be counted on, as around 1/4 of her guards were Earth ponies, and she did not know where their loyalties would ultimately lay. \n\nAnd yet she chose to rule by force. \n\nShe wasn't a tyrant, at least in her own mind, yet, so she instructed her unicorn troops to lift key figures into the air, immobilizing them safely. \n\nAt first this worked, the loudest and most instigating ponies on the edges of the crowd were surrounded by softly glowing magic fields as the Royal Guard began to work the crowd. \n\nAt first, this seemed to be working. The rest of the ponies were shocked into quietness over this act, as dozens of floating ponies gently bobbed above the crowd. \n\nThen a solitary anonymous voice shouted \"Put them down!\"\n\nAnd the crowd took up the chant. \n\nAnd began to push forward. \n\nThe Royal Guards were taken aback. They had never expected to get into direct conflict with their own people. This wasn't a part of their training. \n\nAnd one of them lost focus. \n\nAs the massive sea of angry ponies began to press towards the line armor-plated Royal Guards, one of their unicorn sorcerers lost track of the dissident they were floating. \n\nAnd the poor pony caught in its spell began floating upward, unnoticed. \n\nAt first above the crowd, then above the towers of the Palace, and then amongst the clouds themselves. \n\nAnd no one below noticed as every eye was focused on the protest that was about to turn bloody. \n\nThe Guards held the line, as thousands of angry Earth ponies began to press against them, shouting in their faces to free their suspended friends. \n\nThe crowd's demand was met with dour silence on those brightly armored muzzles.\n\nAnd suddenly, from the middle of the crowd, a rock sailed through the air. \n\nIt struck a unicorn guard directly in the middle of his helmet. He collapsed.

The crowd would have none of it. \n\nThen she became stern, admonishing them for their behavior, and the damage they were doing to the courtyard. \n\nAt this, the crowd began angry murmurings. Celestia's dismissive attitude igniting a fire in the heart of these downtrodden groundlings. The shouting broke out, and then the wordless, echoing roar of years of frustration poured out of thousands of throats. \n\nThen she made her worst mistake. Celestia threatened to call in the Royal Guards. \n\nBelow her were five thousand angry and iron-shod Earth ponies, strong from years of lifting and carrying and worked into a frothing frenzy by Mayor Mare's inciting speech. \n\nAnd she had approximately two hundred Royal Guards. \n\nAnd even that number can't be counted on, as around 1/4 of her guards were Earth ponies, and she did not know where their loyalties would ultimately lay. \n\nAnd yet she chose to rule by force. \n\nShe wasn't a tyrant, at least in her own mind, yet, so she instructed her unicorn troops to lift key figures into the air, immobilizing them safely. \n\nAt first this worked, the loudest and most instigating ponies on the edges of the crowd were surrounded by softly glowing magic fields as the Royal Guard began to work the crowd. \n\nAt first, this seemed to be working. The rest of the ponies were shocked into quietness over this act, as dozens of floating ponies gently bobbed above the crowd. \n\nThen a solitary anonymous voice shouted \"Put them down!\"\n\nAnd the crowd took up the chant. \n\nAnd began to push forward. \n\nThe Royal Guards were taken aback. They had never expected to get into direct conflict with their own people. This wasn't a part of their training. \n\nAnd one of them lost focus. \n\nAs the massive sea of angry ponies began to press towards the line armor-plated Royal Guards, one of their unicorn sorcerers lost track of the dissident they were floating. \n\nAnd the poor pony caught in its spell began floating upward, unnoticed. \n\nAt first above the crowd, then above the towers of the Palace, and then amongst the clouds themselves. \n\nAnd no one below noticed as every eye was focused on the protest that was about to turn bloody. \n\nThe Guards held the line, as thousands of angry Earth ponies began to press against them, shouting in their faces to free their suspended friends. \n\nThe crowd's demand was met with dour silence on those brightly armored muzzles.\n\nAnd suddenly, from the middle of the crowd, a rock sailed through the air. \n\nIt struck a unicorn guard directly in the middle of his helmet. He collapsed. Unfortunately, so did his magic field, far in the clouds above. \n\nNo one noticed when the pony began to fall, only seconds later when it's voice raised in a death-fear howl finally broke past the general noise of the protest, and everypony looked up to see...\n\nBig McIntosh falling...\n\nFear in his eyes...\n\nBut it was too late. \n\nThe spot where his ragged and broken body finally came to rest has since become a pilgrimage spot that everypony must make at least once in their lives. \n\nIt was the spot where the killing began. \n\nAnd it was years before it would finally end. \n\n--------------------------------------\nNot done yet, this was just backstory, next below will be a 'slice-of-life wartime vignette' with the main characters getting split along loyalty lines.

", "id": "czyppyx"}, {"comment": "The sky was brown-black over Ponyville, fed by the fires of dozens of brightly painted buildings crumbling into ash. Some of the fires burned in strange colors that hurt the eye, revealing their magical origin. \n\nSeveral units of the Earth Pony Opposition National Army had converted Sugarcube Corner into a fortified position, in order to secure food for the swelling number of troops that the Tyrant Celestia's horrific actions had motivated. \n\nMr. Cake had given over use of the building to Commander Pinkie Pie almost at the beginning the revolution, as an early suppression sweep by the Royal Guard had trampled Mrs. Cake to death right in front of the store. Right in front of him.\n\nAnd while he was powerless to stop the unswayable line of armored guards as they stomped through the streets, he could at least see that the fruits of their entire life would be used to strike back at the cruel and seemingly untouchable Alicorn dictator. \n\nCurrently, the kitchen was set up as a surgery triage where Nurse Redheart desperately trotted from bed to bed, prioritizing patients for Doc Top to operate on. \n\nAll of the countertops had been turned into impromptu beds, and red Earth pony blood stained every surface. \n\nThe smell was a thick coppery stink that clung to Nurse Redheart's nostrils like a living thing, scrabbling to desperately prevent her from forgetting a single face of those that had passed on. \n\nAnd yet she kept moving, pushing back the images of her friends and families, horribly twisted and mangled by the ferocity of the unicorns and pegasi. \n\n\"Tug that tourniquet tighter, Marble Pie. We don't want her bleeding out before the doc can see her.\" she tried to nicker glibly, to keep the shy and skittish pony from panicking at all of the gore while she helped. \n\nMarble pie just nodded slightly and tugged the bandages tighter with her teeth. The taste of infection and wet metal touched her tongue, but she did not flinch. This time. \n\nNurse Redheart then trotted briskly over to two harnessed ponies carrying a stretcher in through the front door, they dodged inside just as a mortar round struck in the middle of the street outside, sending down a shower of marzipan-colored dust from the ceiling boards. \n\nCoughing into her bloodied hoof, she shook her light pink mane and re-adjusted her sweat-drenched hat while she directed the ambulance ponies to a recently emptied counter space next to the large industrial blenders. \n\n\"External abdominal bleeding, possible puncture wound. Broken right back ankle, compound.\" she mumbled with an ease she would have been horrified by just a year ago. So many deaths since then, can't focus on the death, just focus on who you can save...\n\n\"Not life threatening, eyes are mfmnnh mrnn rspnsve...\" she spoke carefully around the small flashlight held in her mouth as she peered into the pony patient's pinched-open eyes.\n\n\"Put this one over there in the non-critical section and give her... half a plate of cookies\" she gestured with a hoof towards the store proper, where a dozen other ponies sprawled on bloodied sheets, awaiting their chance at survival. Her supplies were running low, and she couldn't waste painkillers on those not in critical need. \n\nShe had seen friends come through, had held their hooves as they bled out, bright round eyes dimming with fear and pain towards the end. Something inside of her died too, with every one she couldn't save. And there were so, so many she couldn't save...\n\nThe beginning of the war was Big McIntosh's gruesome death. Applejack's family had always been tightly knit, and many of those brave ponies from Sweet Apple Acres had entered her clinic in the subsequent months. She had been there when Granny Smith had been brought in, her haunches crushed under a rock dropped as a bomb by a flight of pegasi while she was trying to flee her burning farm. She couldn't save her, the doc couldn't save her. And by her side stood Applejack the entire time, teeth gritted and eyes barely holding back tears. \n\nMaybe that's why that previously friendly and loyal pony decided to become an assassin. Applejack hadn't told anyone of her plan, she just up and left the fortifications one night. That was the last time we saw her alive. \n\nShortly after that, Princess Celestia made a magically enhanced announcement, trumpeted to every corner of the land that every pony still loyal to the Crown should come gather outside the gates of Canterlot for an important message. The rebels had some few allies in the magical and flying armies, and so the news of the Tyrant Celestia's announcement filtered even into the ears of the Earth Pony Reserves. \n\n\"Good Citizens of Equestria, let it be known that last night a foul member of E.P.O.N.A managed to evade my personal guards and make her way into my very own bedchamber. Yes, I know, I was as shocked as you to find that these filthy dirt-eaters would stoop so low as to threaten my royal personage. \n\nIt is a sign that they know their military forces are outmatched!\" she whinnied as she thrashed the air with her forehooves, emphasizing the loyalists military power. \n\n\"They cannot fly, our squadrons of trained pegasi assault them from above. They cannot do magic, and our unicorn warmages twist their guts with snakes of green fire and burn their refuges with howling arcane light. It is only a matter of time before they realize their struggles are futile against us, the obviously superior ponies. For the very fact of our birth renders us their natural rulers. And it is only fair that the menial tasks of lifting and carrying be given to those ponies that are best suited for it. \n\nIn fact, without our wisdom in guidance, it is obvious that the Earth ponies would have no quality of life at all! They should be thankful for our great benevolence, our firm and compassionate care. But no! They do this! Send assassins...\"\n\n\"Behold! This is the body of my once-friend Applejack!\" she said with a timed trumpet fanfare as she tugged the bloodied sheet off of the sad wreck off to her side on the balcony overseeing the courtyard. \n\nAnd indeed, underneath was the mangled corpse and frayed hat that once belonged to the pony of Honesty. So twisted and burned by the Tyrant Celestia's forbidden magicks that only the torn cutie mark and coat color could identify her. \n\n\"And so it goes for all who oppose my rightful heavens-ordained rule!\" She shouted, lifting her head and spreading her wings, a magical beacon instantly pulsing upwards from the balcony, piercing the clouds and projecting her words and the sad wreck onto the sky for all to see. \n\nThat spelled the beginning of the end for the rebellion, that psychological blow removed any illusion that the Earth ponies had a chance of winning. After that night, Nurse Redheart and Doc Top treated more attempted suicides than war victims. And who knows how many actually succeeded...\n\nAnd here she was, months into this unwinnable conflict. Sure the Earth ponies had personal strength and organization. None of this compared to the edge that having air and magic superiority. She knew that some day the Royal Guards would come for her, and she didn't know if she had the strength to fight back. Nopony knew how they would react, when the time came, when the metal struck flesh and the blood flowed. \n\nNurse Redheart faintly hoped that, when they did come for her, the faces of her fallen friends would give her the strength to resist as they did. \n\n\n\n", "id": "czymeav"}, {"comment": "Well written, my only real beef being celestia is out of character but hey, in order for a war to exist there has to be an instigator right? \nNevertheless the celestia in here fits her role perfectly, a tyrant is always attempting to strongarm everyone to docility which in turn flares the rebellions further. I was a little sad to see a main character offed so quickly but remembered plot armor and happy times went out the window which weirdly enough I liked because you gave it a more... authentic feel\n although admittedly I became more interested in the war as a whole rather than any specific character which made me more detached to the deaths that the war was causing, my advice: add more character to this redheart let us see how she lives her life and what kind of people run the rebellion.\n In contrast you could even give the story a great duality by also giving us a look into the life of a royal guard and show us though him/her celestia off-air or maybe focus on the guard itself and having us see his/her reasons for working as celestia's weapon either way I am definitely intrigued by this story, it's got a lot of dark assets to it which makes it seem like a realistic outcome and leaves me praying for the safety of the characters as with the plot armor gone anyone who does not watch their steps is fair game. \nGive us more investment in the characters and this easily goes from 7/10 to a full on 10/10 that being said it's a good story that definitely achieves the feeling of realism and finality that I was looking for \n\n7/10 would read again\n \n\n", "id": "czz5g7e"}, {"comment": "Yeah, my headcannon is that the early part of the rebellion was accidental. She really didn't want anyone hurt but had a very tense situation get out of hoof and then suddenly there's blood on the ground and everyone is blaming her.\n\nMy biggest problem with writingprompts is that you need to get SOMETHING in the first hour or so for it to even get visibility. I'd rather have an entire day to come up with something and post it with equal chance for visibility. \n\nHmm, that gives me an idea...\n\nEither way, I had planned a slow descent into desperation with a sharp corner morality turn at Twilight's death in front of Celestia, seemingly at Celestia's own hand, but I did not have time between tickets yesterday. \n\n>I was a little sad to see a main character offed so quickly \n\nYeah, I needed to pull the heartstrings in a shocking and abrupt way, and good ol' Big McIntosh being one of my personal faves. \n\nThe real 'conflict' is meant to stem from something that would never happen in canon Equestria: the dissatisfaction of the Earth ponies. \n\nI have to confess, I haven't really seen a lot of modern MLP, just season 1 and a few odd episodes scattered here and there. But when I was watching the Winter Wrap-up, I commented to a friend about the division of labor, and that got into a whole discussion about hypothetical economical systems and such. \n\nAnd I pointed out that the richest main pony everyone knew was a unicorn, and that _all_ of the nobility were unicorns, and that the pegasi got a lot of perks that were 'out of reach' (lol) of the Earth ponies. \n\nI know Faust has gone to great lengths to point out how important the Earth ponies are to the cycle of nature, and the balance of harmony, and Celestia echoes this. \n\nBut what of an alternative universe where this wasn't the case. That Celestia only gave this concept lip service because she knew that there was no way they could get the bourgeois unicorns to stoop to manual labor, and the pegasi aren't focused enough for tasks like agriculture and medicine. \n\nShe's stuck in a hard place, obviously the quality of life is objectively better for unicorns and pegasi, and Celestia herself holds her position as ruler due to the fact that she is both. \n\nSo, she's holding up a thin veneer of accommodation, using animistic mumbo jumbo to give meaningless stature to the Earth pony's labors (like a job title only 'promotion') in order to keep them from realizing just how much they do, and how little they benefit from it. \n\nIn fact, the wealthiest of Earth ponies are self-made, while the average unicorn is just nobility already. Effortless luxury. \n\nI mean, do you REALLY think Rarity can afford her lifestyle just as a Seamstress!?\n\nSo, that's where this story idea originated from, years before this prompt. \n\nWhen I saw it, I knew I had to write it. Unfortunately I didn't have the time or the in-depth pony knowledge to do it real justice. \n\n> my advice: add more character to this \n\nAnd good advice it is, though I wanted the shift to Sugarcube Corner to be exactly that kind of shift. We got a momentary shock as a beloved innocent passes, and then SLAM life is pretty bleak and you gotta save who you gotta save. \n\nThere's a word for it in literature, that emotional flip-flop, I just can't remember it at the moment. \n\n>nd what kind of people run the rebellion.\n\nThat was a major intention of mine, Pinkie was set up as the commander, and I wanted a tense battle plan/supplies and situation rundown in the rebel warroom. \n\nIt was going to be extra-tragic because under her ragged and wartorn exterior, Pinkie was still gonna be the funloving trickster she always was, but not in a cool 'The Joker/Riddler' style combat trickster, but someone who knows that they are losing and plans fallbacks using confetti mortars and close-combat kazoo training because _that's all they have left to keep their people alive nowadays_. \n\nThat scene may have actually been too tragically heartbreaking to write properly... Dunno, I'm kind of scared to try. \n\n>the life of a royal guard and show us though him/her celestia off-air or \n\nOh man that is an EXCELLENT idea!\n\nThe guards don't hate the Earth ponies, they're just unfailingly loyal to a being they literally consider a deity embodied. The slice-o-life would include his doubts as to Celestia's choices, but a grudging admittance that she has a tough position with no easy answers. Maybe he'll reminisce about a longtime guard friend, how they came up through the academy together, got in trouble together, and as the rebellion began, his friend turned in his armor and went back home to protect his family. \n\nSomething like that.\n\nCelestia 'off hours' would be pretty mental at this point in the civil war. Not because she was unstable to begin with. On the contrary, she was very much a truly benevolent ruler. Everything had been going so well, so well... Nightmare Moon had been neutralized, Discord had been brought under heel, and everything was prosperous and productive. \n\nUntil that argument with Mayor Mare about the road repair budget...\n\nDidn't she just simply realize how much More important the bunting for the Royal Carriage was? Of course she couldn't, small minded little nag...\n\nNevertheless, the Royal Personage will broach no besmirchment. Let us see how she enjoys an apple embargo for a few months...\n\nAnd that begins Celestia's eventual collapse into tyrannical madness. \n\nYes I know Celestia's not that petty, but this shard realm's Celestia is just a touch affluenzic. \n\n>Give us more investment in the characters and this easily goes fro\n\nThis is exactly what I would love to do. I'd make a novella-length The Histories of the Equestrian Civil War, with slice-o-lifes, mass combat, tragically fated friends and lovers separated by the divide. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't think I have the time or the skill to do it justice at this point in my growth. \n\nI thank you for your excellent feedback, this is exactly the kind of thing I need to improve my style.

The clock continues to beep frequently, the countdown like a woodpecker driving into my skull.\n\nI look back at my clock, then at the scenery: A beautiful park, children yelling and sprinting everywhere, small bunnies chewing on the carrots being thrown by adults and picnics all around. A chuckle escapes my lips as I thought about ants perhaps overtaking one of the families, for the scent of delicious food could sway the little insect bastards\n\nIt beeped again. Oh god, why did it beep again. I can't do this, I need to run. I slowly stand up, gazing left and right. Starting to walk, each step even louder than the beeping. I can't concentrate. I can't breathe.\n\nThere was a minute left for my soulmate. I start to scratch at my clock, trying to claw it away so it stops, this wasn't exactly fair. I wanted to decide who my soulmate was, not this irritating tool, whoever designed this was a bastard.\n\nMy eyes dart to every woman nearby. They were reading books, jogging through the park, and mostly doing whatever the hell they wanted to. I feel incredibly enviousness to them, they don't have to deal with their soulmates.

She definitely wouldn't like me.\n\nI close my eyes and breathe, or try my best at doing so. I relax gently and slowly, a woman's pale blue ghost leans in and softly caresses my cheek. She whispers to me that It will be fine. I wake up as a woman is poking me in the side. A panicked  attempt to escape from her. The beeping in my clock endless, as is hers. This was her... This was her! Why am I running!?\n\nShe grips my coat and tries her hardest to pull my back, making me stumble onto my rear and her having an embarrassed look as some passerby watches us both strangely.

I didn't know whether she'd be cute, quirky or maybe even a man. Was I even prepared to know? The clock continues to beep frequently, the countdown like a woodpecker driving into my skull.\n\nI look back at my clock, then at the scenery: A beautiful park, children yelling and sprinting everywhere, small bunnies chewing on the carrots being thrown by adults and picnics all around. A chuckle escapes my lips as I thought about ants perhaps overtaking one of the families, for the scent of delicious food could sway the little insect bastards\n\nIt beeped again. Oh god, why did it beep again. I can't do this, I need to run. I slowly stand up, gazing left and right. Starting to walk, each step even louder than the beeping. I can't concentrate. I can't breathe.\n\nThere was a minute left for my soulmate. I start to scratch at my clock, trying to claw it away so it stops, this wasn't exactly fair. I wanted to decide who my soulmate was, not this irritating tool, whoever designed this was a bastard.\n\nMy eyes dart to every woman nearby. They were reading books, jogging through the park, and mostly doing whatever the hell they wanted to. I feel incredibly enviousness to them, they don't have to deal with their soulmates. What if my soulmate doesn't like me? Was that even possible?\n\nIt beeped again! Oh god why does it beep so loudly? There was thirty seconds left. I can't stand anymore, my legs drop as I stumble to the nearest bench, letting myself clumsily rest on my side. I looked like a homeless man. She definitely wouldn't like me.\n\nI close my eyes and breathe, or try my best at doing so. I relax gently and slowly, a woman's pale blue ghost leans in and softly caresses my cheek. She whispers to me that It will be fine. I wake up as a woman is poking me in the side. A panicked  attempt to escape from her. The beeping in my clock endless, as is hers. This was her... This was her! Why am I running!?\n\nShe grips my coat and tries her hardest to pull my back, making me stumble onto my rear and her having an embarrassed look as some passerby watches us both strangely.  I finally stop acting like a child and compose myself, fixing my jacket and then gazing at her. There was no freeze, she looked fine. Not beautiful. This definitely wasn't fair, Mike last week got a model! What, I get this?\n\nShe looks me over as the relentless beeping finally stops, exclaiming in a stereotypical Japanese female voice \"Thank you very much!\".\n\nSilence... Awkward, terrible silence as we both lack the nerve to say anything. She breaks the ice after a few minutes. \"Hi... I'm Anne.\"\n\nI can't speak, I want to. But I couldn't say anything, this was beyond horrible. The worst feeling in the world. Staring at my soulmate directly in her eyes and lacking the necessary confidence to speak.\n\n\"You like chess?\" She asks me as I freeze, looking away at another woman, then back at her. I shudder and close my eyes.\n\n\"Y-yeah... You?\" The nervous pitch in my voice blatantly obvious.\n\n\"Course I do...\" She sits down next to me, rubbing the back of her neck and looking away as well. She wasn't any better with this entire scenario.\n\n\"I'm Mark. I like chess and I like videogames, and I like... I like exercise? I mean, everyone likes exercise, who doesn't like exercise, fat peo...\"\n\nShe shuts my mouth with her palm, snickering quietly and then slowly lowering it. My eyes widen and then slowly close. I am so stupid.\n\n\"I'm kinda glad it was you. Outside of so many people. You're pretty cute.\"\nShe smiles warmly at me and reaches for a small piece of paper. She already had a pen and paper prepared. Why didn't I?! \n\nShe wrote down her number and offered it to me. \"Here, have my number.\"\n\nI took it slowly, looking at her as if she had gone crazy. \"Just like that? I don't... have to do anything, don't I have to seduce you?\"\n\nShe shrugged, going \"Nope\" with a delighted tone. The same damn warm smile on her face, it was becoming intoxicating.\n\nI gazed down at her number, then back at her. I didn't know what to say, and neither did she. It was the most random meeting in the world, at least relative to me.\n\"Do you like... videogames?\" I asked her, looking down at my feet as to try and keep my confidence up. The shoes were damn good anyway, who doesn't want to look at them?\n\n\"You already know the answer to that.\" She chuckled, slowly sitting down and leaning her head onto my shoulder.\n\n\"This ain't that bad...\" I murmured, her head was warm and comfy, it was nice.\n\n\"Mmhm.\" \n\n\"Could get used to this.\"\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\nThere was no more reason to speak, I think... Everything that needed to be said, was said. At least I hope so.\n\nThe End.", "id": "cy6mazu"}, {"comment": "That was wonderful. Amazing job, I never expected something this good.

Isn\u2019t that obvious.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHeck your subconscious figured that out before you did.\u201d I looked at the two doors. \u201cSo which one will it be?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make choices for you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of both.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy choice is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat would you pick?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe same one you\u2019d pick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.

I\u2019m you.\u201d There were a few moments as the dreamer got hung up on the choice at hand. If he stays so indecisive this dream will continue for two cycles. If we get stuck here I can\u2019t find out any interesting information. This job will go bust. \u201cIf you look at it the other way which would you rather do.

That and 100 of them would be a basically a stampede of horses. It\u2019s not entirely out of the question that if they attacked all at once that you\u2019d wake up. However if it\u2019s one at a time perhaps you could collect them, dip them in light colours and glitter. Your daughters would go mental for that stuff. That\u2019s of course assuming that they haven\u2019t frozen to death due to the inability to maintain their own body heat due to their small size. Then maybe they are huddling together like penguins. The horse sized duck may be a better choice. Only a single target. It probably won\u2019t be able to fly under its own weight. That assuming that it can move at all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA duck as big as a horse. That\u2019d be terrifying.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d probably be quite slow as well. A ducks legs aren\u2019t designed to hold that sort of weight. As for 100 duck sized horses, that\u2019s a lot of horseshoes to be trampled by.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this a dream?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. I thought you had already figured that out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo why is my subconscious looking at this from a logical point of view? Surely anything could happen. It\u2019s a dream.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true. But then why are you thinking of this logically. It\u2019s a ridiculous situation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wish I could just wake up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAfter this dream? Really. Won\u2019t having memory of this dream be worse? Surely it\u2019ll be better to wait this out. Cope with it now and we don\u2019t have to deal with memory of this for the rest of our lives.\u201d I had to keep them in the dream at all costs. If they wake up now then this will all have been for naught. \n\n\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo do we wait here and do nothing for however long this dream will be or we pick a door. For all we know there could be nothing behind both of them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut which one?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShall we look at a worst possible case scenario then? 100 duck sized horses.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stampeded to death.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd 1 horse sized duck.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt eats me.\u201d\n\n\nI was stunned into silence for a moment. \u201cIt eats you?

Above the doors is a sign. The sign reads *\"Choose your own adventure.\"*\n\n\nThe doors have their own signs on them. One reads \"100 duck-sized horses\" and the other reads \"1 horse-sized duck.\" \n\n\nYou feel like you've made choices before. So, so many choices. Some of them have ended in death. Whatever magic brought you here somehow lets you remember all the failed paths you have taken.\n\n*To choose the 100 duck-sized horses, continue below.*\n\n*To choose the 1 horse-sized duck, jump to Part 2.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Part 1: 100 duck-sized horses**\n\nYou reach over to the left hand door, the one labeled \"100 duck-sized horses.\" You open the door and see a large, domed room. There are feed troughs along one wall, and what looks like a few dozen tiny horses, about the size of a normal duck. \nYou look around, but there are no other exits or rooms. \n\n\nYou start to feel funny. The room begins to grow very large. You fall forward, and when your hands hit the floor they looks like hooves. All the other horses grow bigger and bigger, until they are the same size that you are. A few horses trot over, welcoming you to their ranks. You are now one more duck-sized horse, waiting for the next person to choose their door.\n\n\n*The end*\n\nIf you want to go back and choose the other door, turn to page the start of this post.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Part 2: 1 horse-sized duck**\n\nYou reach over to the right hand door, the one labeled \"1 horse-sized duck.\" You open the door and see a large room with a bright *exit* sign over a door in the far wall. In one corner there is what looks like a pond with reeds. A very large duck is sleeping there. You think he is about horse-sized, but it is hard to measure. \n\n\nYou slowly push the door further in, willing it not to make a squeak. You leave the door open, and walk slowly through the room. You barely tip-toe, desperately praying not to wake the duck.\n\n\nYou get to the exit door. You grab the handle, and mercifully it turns. As you pull the door opens, it scrapes along thr ground. You turn to look, and the duck has woken up! It heaves its bulk off the ground, as you despreately pull open the door. The duck rushes right at you, honking, but you manage to dash through the door just in time! The duck smashes into the doorframe, but it is too big to fit through. \n\n\nYou back away from the duck, and look around. You are in a short hallway, with two more doors at the end. One of them is labeled \"Dumpledor\" and the other is labeled \"Snape\".\n\n\n*To choose Dumpledor, finishing the damn story yourself.*\n\n*To choose Snape, you can also finish the damn story yourself.*\n\n\n\n"], [1, "[removed]"], [1, "I scream as I'm thrown into a...

For the, like, 10 billionth time. \n\n\"Oh my God, can you just not-\" I start to say. However, I stop when the blindfold is taken off. My kidnapper is gone. However, I am in the *most amazing place ever*. Okay... I guess \"most amazing\" is a little subjective. I've never been more than 80 kilometers away from my town after all.\n\nBut there are trees. Short trees with smooth barks, trees that tower over with me with wavy branches. Trees with a lot of green leaves. Trees with barely any orange/yellow/brown leaves left on them. Bare trees covered in white. \n\nI *love* trees. \n\nIf it weren't for the ground, that felt more like a carpeted floor, it would've been exactly like that forest I used to go to as a younger, happier child. \n\nI walk on the soft path, staring at the glorious trees and remembering my trips to the forest in the past. I remember climbing those tall trees that seemed to be endless. I remember how the sun washed my face as I sat on the highest tree- *Wait!* I frowned as I looked around the place. *Where is the sun?*\n\nI looked up at the sky to see what was not a sky but... a chalkboard. \n\n*Thanks for reminding me about school. I have a ton of homework to do.*\n\nI shrieked as I saw a huge hand, holding a humongous piece of white chalk, writing on the board. *You must choose.*\n\n\"What the hell?\" I yell at the sky. \"Choose what?

I-\" Just when I'm about to continue, I see two doors \n\nEach door has a nail drilled into it's center, with a rectangular wooden sign hanging on it. The only difference between the two doors (except for their positions) was the writing on the signs. \n\n\"100 duck-sized horses\" was written on the left sign, while the sign on the right reads \"1 horse-sized duck\". \n\nI laugh hysterically until I hear a voice. *Choose. This will show us who you really are.*\n\nI laugh again. \"Why should I choose?\" HAHAHAHAHAHA\n\n\"Choose or be stuck here forever to die.\" When I heard those words, the trees started to fall. \n\n\"AGH!\" I yelled as one tree nearly fell on me. \n\n\"These two doors are the only ways out... choose wisely.\" \n\n\"Shut up Ms. Narrator!\" I shouted at the voice that seemed to be coming from nowhere. \n\n\"It's Mr. Narrator,\" was the reply. \"Choose.\"\n\nI stare at the two doors not knowing what to do. So I close my eyes and run for a random door. \n\n*CRASH!* I bump my head into the wall between the two doors. I sigh. *Seriously?* I feel my hand touching the knob on the right. \n\n1 horse-sized duck.\n\nWhen I let go of the doorknob, the door automatically locks, leaving me in a white room with... A HORSE-SIZED DUCK! The duck is... HUMONGOUS (in the horse way) and ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! Oh, those white feathers! What could be more beautiful than-\n\nThe duck runs straight towards me as if it wants to kill me. I yell. \n\n\"Fight!\" I hear Mr. Narrator yell. \"Fight!\" \n\nI scream as the huge duck chases after me. \n\nI groaned. Why had I chosen to pick a door? If I had just picked neither, I would've just been stuck with a bunch of fallen trees instead of a creepy (but beautiful) duck. \n\nI run and run and run until I run (haha) out of energy. \n\n\"HELPPPP!!! I DON'T WANNA DIE! I'M WAY TOO YOUNG!\" I scream all these words with an extremely high pitched voice. \"NOOOOO!!!\"\n\nAs I screamed, the duck started to wither. It's eyes rolled, as it slumped to the ground. \n\n\"What the hell just happened?\" I say, as I look at the duck. On the duck's neck is a necklace with a key on it. I look up to see a door I didn't see before in front of me. I use the key. The door opens. \n\n\"YES!\" I scream as I jump out, just to be blindfolded again. \n\n\n\nWhen I wake up, I'm in the guidance office, looking at my guidance counselor, who's grinning. \"So you prefer size over number, eh?\" \n\n\"Mr. Narrator?\" I say with a frown. He does sound just like Mr. Narrator. \"What just-?\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah, right!\" Mr. Narrator/Guidance counselor beamed at me. \"We're doing a psychological test on a few of our students! We injected something into you to make you believe you were in... that place. It helps us learn more about our students. And it's also really fun! The horse-sized duck found your screams really scary by the way!\" \n\n\"Uh... sure... I've got to go.\" I say, rushing out the door, thinking of the homework I need to cram at home. \n\n*God, wasn't that disappointing.* I thought. *Just when I was in some cool fantasy thing...

"], [1, "I double-bagged it today and found myself in a strange room. \n\nFor those who are not necessarily aware of what double-bagging is, permit me to explain. \"Double-bagging\" is referring to putting two bags of tea in one mug. Doing so causes a strange effect in which the added burst of caffeine reacts to the fabric of reality in an unusual way. I first did this who knows how long ago and have not been back to my original dimension since. Thankfully, no matter how far I seem to go into the unknown, I always seem to have a stable internet connection which is convenient for chronicling my...I suppose I call them my Double-Bagging Adventures. I strongly urge you try this for yourselves. I have seen unimaginable sights; beings made of pure color energy, lounges for time-travelers, and physical incarnations of tarot cards just to name a few. However, if you have become particularly comfortable in your own reality where people do not spontaneously turn into gingerbread versions of themselves, then I would not recommend double-bagging. I'm not sure if I'll ever make it back \"home\" and even more uncertain what will happen next when I put two bags of tea in my favorite Spider-Man mug. So far, nothing has happened twice. But as I was saying...\n\nI double-bagged it today and found myself in a strange room. \n\nThe room was lit by florescent lighting which I thought took some of the mysterious atmosphere away. The lights buzzed mundanely as I observed the rest of the room which had robin eggshell blue walls which put me in the mind of dentist offices. The room even had a similar smell of fluoride and anxiety. There was no furniture save an old, cheaply made wicker chair which I currently sat it. In front of me were two, large, tantalizingly red buttons. The buttons were labelled plainly in a no-nonsense kind of text that simply read, from left to right respectively:\n\n*100 Duck-Sized Horses* and *1 Horse-Sized Duck*\n\nThe buttons fascinated me. There was no kind of doors, windows, not even cracks in the paint on the walls. It was as if this was a pocket of the universe specifically created to house one crappy chair and two very tempting buttons. \n\nThere were many questions to address. Firstly, what were the buttons attached to? There was clearly electricity flowing to this room but it wasn't clear if the buttons led anywhere. There were no panels, not even holes in the wall that they fit into. Upon close observation, the buttons seemed to have grown organically right out of the wall. \n\nThis also begged the question if anything would happen if I pressed the buttons. As I stated before, I could see no discernible door of any kind. Of course this was going off of the assumption that by pressing the buttons, either a horse-sized duck or a hundred duck-sized horses would flood the room. \n\nI hadn't considered that before and I sat down in the wicker chair which creaked under my weight. I blew the steam off of my tea and gently sipped as I contemplated the two buttons. *Perhaps,* I thought to myself, *They transform you into a giant duck or a herd of miniature horses.* I started thinking which I would prefer to be turned into if that is, in fact, what the buttons' functions were. I thought that I would be more of a single mind if I turned into the horse-sized duck but that is rather large for a duck. I wouldn't fit in with other ducks and I would frighten people. I'd probably get picked up by a circus or some kind of research lab and I wouldn't want that. \n\nBut conversely, what if I became one hundred duck-sized horses? Would I operate on a hive-mind mentality or would my consciousness be spread across equally over a hundred horses? The obvious benefit to being such a small horse is that no one could ride you unless they were a gnome or perhaps an unusually small dwarf. Is that what would become for me? Would I become the mounts for some small and yet terrifying fantasy army? Or would I be free to roam the plains, coming and going as I please? Perhaps I would be captured and my one hundred part consciousness would be spread thin as people began to take duck-sized horses as pets. \"They're so cute!\" I could hear the imaginary consumers now. \"So tiny and they hardly make any mess and the kids just love 'em. Little Johnny likes to strap his action figures to ours. We call her Buttercup!\"\n\nI suddenly shot up from my chair. *No,* I thought. *I would not let me and my tiny horse brethren to be shamed with such a title as* Buttercup*.* Somethings are just too indecent to imagine. I stared at the buttons and realized that this postulating was useless without knowing for certain what effect pushing the button would have. \n\nMaybe it was activated by touch. I could take the chair, press a button with one of the legs, and watch what happens to it. But if I was wrong and the effect of the buttons was not concerned with touch then I would be taking a large risk. \n\nI paced back and forth for a while. I shouted aloud to see if anyone would respond. Only the droning of the lights called back to me. I sat back in the chair thinking that if I did nothing, something might happen. I sat there for as long as I could hold out until I bellowed a kind of battle cry, rushed from my seat, and pressed both buttons.\n\nAt first, nothing happened. I then saw a thin line appear in the wall to my left. The line began to grow in width and I realized the wall was creating a window in itself. Staring from the window and behind a sheet of glass was a very annoyed looking, very large duck and one hundred tiny horses. The room they stood in was dark and looked far too small to be holding that many animals. Some of the horses were stacked on top of each other, some stood on a small table in the center of the room, most milled about on the floor, anxiously weaving between the duck's massive legs.\n\nThe duck glared at me in a way that only duck's can glare and said, \"Well, you're no fun.\"\n\nSomething clicked into place and the floor opened up to drop me back into my comfy couch where I had initially taken my first sip. I took another sip now and was pleased to find that it was still warm.\n\nMy couch now sat in what looked like some kind of submersible room deep in some ocean where alien fish flicked by my window, curious of their new neighbor. I am never certain where I will end up at the end of these excursions but at the very least, the room seemed comfortable and had a kettle, so that was convenient. I am not of a scientific mind but I hope that the chronicles of my inter-dimensional travels are making it to my \"home\" reality's internet and I hope that people better suited than I are researching the effects of double-bagging tea. Until that moment, I will continue my travels and I will continue to document them in the blind hope that someone might find them and read them and I will put the kettle on.

Above the doors is a sign. The sign reads *\"Choose your own adventure.\"*\n\n\nThe doors have their own signs on them.

Whatever magic brought you here somehow lets you remember all the failed paths you have taken.\n\n*To choose the 100 duck-sized horses, continue below.*\n\n*To choose the 1 horse-sized duck, jump to Part 2.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Part 1: 100 duck-sized horses**\n\nYou reach over to the left hand door, the one labeled \"100 duck-sized horses.\" You open the door and see a large, domed room. There are feed troughs along one wall, and what looks like a few dozen tiny horses, about the size of a normal duck. \nYou look around, but there are no other exits or rooms. \n\n\nYou start to feel funny. The room begins to grow very large. You fall forward, and when your hands hit the floor they looks like hooves. All the other horses grow bigger and bigger, until they are the same size that you are. A few horses trot over, welcoming you to their ranks. You are now one more duck-sized horse, waiting for the next person to choose their door.\n\n\n*The end*\n\nIf you want to go back and choose the other door, turn to page the start of this post.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Part 2: 1 horse-sized duck**\n\nYou reach over to the right hand door, the one labeled \"1 horse-sized duck.\" You open the door and see a large room with a bright *exit* sign over a door in the far wall. In one corner there is what looks like a pond with reeds. A very large duck is sleeping there. You think he is about horse-sized, but it is hard to measure. \n\n\nYou slowly push the door further in, willing it not to make a squeak. You leave the door open, and walk slowly through the room. You barely tip-toe, desperately praying not to wake the duck.\n\n\nYou get to the exit door. You grab the handle, and mercifully it turns. As you pull the door opens, it scrapes along thr ground. You turn to look, and the duck has woken up! It heaves its bulk off the ground, as you despreately pull open the door. The duck rushes right at you, honking, but you manage to dash through the door just in time! The duck smashes into the doorframe, but it is too big to fit through. \n\n\nYou back away from the duck, and look around. You are in a short hallway, with two more doors at the end. One of them is labeled \"Dumpledor\" and the other is labeled \"Snape\".\n\n\n*To choose Dumpledor, finishing the damn story yourself.*\n\n*To choose Snape, you can also finish the damn story yourself.*\n\n\n\n", "id": "d3at7r2"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d3a12sh"}, {"comment": "\n#### Off Topic Comment Section ####\n\n---\n\nThis comment acts as a discussion area for the prompt.

Doing so causes a strange effect in which the added burst of caffeine reacts to the fabric of reality in an unusual way. I first did this who knows how long ago and have not been back to my original dimension since. Thankfully, no matter how far I seem to go into the unknown, I always seem to have a stable internet connection which is convenient for chronicling my...I suppose I call them my Double-Bagging Adventures. I strongly urge you try this for yourselves. I have seen unimaginable sights; beings made of pure color energy, lounges for time-travelers, and physical incarnations of tarot cards just to name a few. However, if you have become particularly comfortable in your own reality where people do not spontaneously turn into gingerbread versions of themselves, then I would not recommend double-bagging. I'm not sure if I'll ever make it back \"home\" and even more uncertain what will happen next when I put two bags of tea in my favorite Spider-Man mug. So far, nothing has happened twice. But as I was saying...\n\nI double-bagged it today and found myself in a strange room. \n\nThe room was lit by florescent lighting which I thought took some of the mysterious atmosphere away. The lights buzzed mundanely as I observed the rest of the room which had robin eggshell blue walls which put me in the mind of dentist offices. The room even had a similar smell of fluoride and anxiety. There was no furniture save an old, cheaply made wicker chair which I currently sat it. In front of me were two, large, tantalizingly red buttons. The buttons were labelled plainly in a no-nonsense kind of text that simply read, from left to right respectively:\n\n*100 Duck-Sized Horses* and *1 Horse-Sized Duck*\n\nThe buttons fascinated me. There was no kind of doors, windows, not even cracks in the paint on the walls. It was as if this was a pocket of the universe specifically created to house one crappy chair and two very tempting buttons. \n\nThere were many questions to address. Firstly, what were the buttons attached to? There was clearly electricity flowing to this room but it wasn't clear if the buttons led anywhere. There were no panels, not even holes in the wall that they fit into. Upon close observation, the buttons seemed to have grown organically right out of the wall. \n\nThis also begged the question if anything would happen if I pressed the buttons. As I stated before, I could see no discernible door of any kind. Of course this was going off of the assumption that by pressing the buttons, either a horse-sized duck or a hundred duck-sized horses would flood the room. \n\nI hadn't considered that before and I sat down in the wicker chair which creaked under my weight. I blew the steam off of my tea and gently sipped as I contemplated the two buttons. *Perhaps,* I thought to myself, *They transform you into a giant duck or a herd of miniature horses.* I started thinking which I would prefer to be turned into if that is, in fact, what the buttons' functions were. I thought that I would be more of a single mind if I turned into the horse-sized duck but that is rather large for a duck. I wouldn't fit in with other ducks and I would frighten people. I'd probably get picked up by a circus or some kind of research lab and I wouldn't want that. \n\nBut conversely, what if I became one hundred duck-sized horses? Would I operate on a hive-mind mentality or would my consciousness be spread across equally over a hundred horses? The obvious benefit to being such a small horse is that no one could ride you unless they were a gnome or perhaps an unusually small dwarf. Is that what would become for me? Would I become the mounts for some small and yet terrifying fantasy army? Or would I be free to roam the plains, coming and going as I please? Perhaps I would be captured and my one hundred part consciousness would be spread thin as people began to take duck-sized horses as pets. \"They're so cute!\" I could hear the imaginary consumers now. \"So tiny and they hardly make any mess and the kids just love 'em. Little Johnny likes to strap his action figures to ours. We call her Buttercup!\"\n\nI suddenly shot up from my chair. *No,* I thought. *I would not let me and my tiny horse brethren to be shamed with such a title as* Buttercup*.* Somethings are just too indecent to imagine. I stared at the buttons and realized that this postulating was useless without knowing for certain what effect pushing the button would have. \n\nMaybe it was activated by touch. I could take the chair, press a button with one of the legs, and watch what happens to it. But if I was wrong and the effect of the buttons was not concerned with touch then I would be taking a large risk. \n\nI paced back and forth for a while. I shouted aloud to see if anyone would respond. Only the droning of the lights called back to me. I sat back in the chair thinking that if I did nothing, something might happen. I sat there for as long as I could hold out until I bellowed a kind of battle cry, rushed from my seat, and pressed both buttons.\n\nAt first, nothing happened. I then saw a thin line appear in the wall to my left. The line began to grow in width and I realized the wall was creating a window in itself. Staring from the window and behind a sheet of glass was a very annoyed looking, very large duck and one hundred tiny horses. The room they stood in was dark and looked far too small to be holding that many animals. Some of the horses were stacked on top of each other, some stood on a small table in the center of the room, most milled about on the floor, anxiously weaving between the duck's massive legs.\n\nThe duck glared at me in a way that only duck's can glare and said, \"Well, you're no fun.\"\n\nSomething clicked into place and the floor opened up to drop me back into my comfy couch where I had initially taken my first sip. I took another sip now and was pleased to find that it was still warm.\n\nMy couch now sat in what looked like some kind of submersible room deep in some ocean where alien fish flicked by my window, curious of their new neighbor. I am never certain where I will end up at the end of these excursions but at the very least, the room seemed comfortable and had a kettle, so that was convenient. I am not of a scientific mind but I hope that the chronicles of my inter-dimensional travels are making it to my \"home\" reality's internet and I hope that people better suited than I are researching the effects of double-bagging tea. Until that moment, I will continue my travels and I will continue to document them in the blind hope that someone might find them and read them and I will put the kettle on.

My heart flutters again. \"Here you go,\" he said as he put a glass in front of me. \"Now you are probably going to think this is strange but I don't know another way to put it.\" He was fidgeting with a coaster.

Tom Harris, the Vice President of Product Design, had been informed that Ethan had been summoned by a client with a consulting emergency, and that his coworker, Maggie Cruz, had been thoroughly briefed. Of course I had. Harris had briefed me last week.\n\nI was just supremely grateful that the change had happened over the weekend, and not, say, in the middle of a presentation. I had kept a change of women\u2019s clothing in my desk all week, just in case. As soon as the morning staff meeting let out, I headed to Ethan\u2019s office and swapped out the women\u2019s clothes for a men\u2019s shirt and pants.\n\nAround 11:30, Harris stuck his head into my office. \u201cHey there. I\u2019m Tom. Tom Harris. Just wanted to introduce myself to Ethan\u2019s replacement.\u201d \n\nI braced myself. When he\u2019d shaken Ethan\u2019s hand a month ago, he\u2019d tried to rip my arm out of its socket. This time his grip was firm but gentle\u2014something I didn\u2019t realize until I\u2019d done my best to crush his hand. He didn\u2019t seem to mind, though. My hands weren\u2019t small for a woman, but they were dwarfed by Tom\u2019s.\n\n\u201cMaggie Cruz,\u201d I said.\n\nHe smiled. I\u2019d never noticed he had dimples before. \u201cCharmed,\u201d he said, holding eye contact. I yanked my hand back. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cYou should come to lunch with me and some of the guys from the meeting. Get to know everyone.\u201d\n\nWhenever Tom invited Ethan along, he'd left me with the tab. I held up a brown paper bag. \u201cSorry boss. Sack lunch.\u201d\n\nHe kept smiling, undeterred. \u201cLeave the lunch at home tomorrow. A few guys from the Seattle office are flying in. You can join us for lunch.\u201d He rapped his knuckles on the doorframe and disappeared down the hallway. I wished that he\u2019d knock on the way in instead of the way out.\n\nFucking Tom.

But his hair was just as thick and glossy as ever, and when I saw him bench pressing in the company gym, he grinned and said, \u201cNew personal record!\u201d Then he volunteered to spot me. I said no thanks. He\u2019d probably drop the barbell on my face.\n\nMaybe he was smoking pot in his office all day. I sniffed him during a workplace safety briefing and he smelled\u2026good. Really good. Edible, even. The point is, not like pot, unfortunately.\n\nI tried to get it out of the office gossips, Gina and Alice. Ethan had spent almost every lunch trashing Tom with them, but it took nearly three weeks for Maggie to earn their trust. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with AutomoTom?\u201d I said, after checking that the break room didn\u2019t hold any Tom-loyalists. \u201cHe\u2019s being really weird.\u201d \n\nGina rolled her eyes and emptied a packet of stevia into her coffee, jangling the multicolored bangles on her left wrist. \u201cEthan obviously left you notes on more than just the patent applications. He and Tom had some sort of crazy vendetta against each other.\u201d \n\nAlice nodded and swallowed her mouthful of egg salad sandwich. \u201cYeah. Ever since Ethan left Tom\u2019s been back to his usual self. Nothing weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re blaming Ethan?\u201d I said, indignant.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly\u201d Alice said. \u201cIt was a two-way street. They hated each other with more passion than I thought two men were capable of. Such passionate men.\u201d She sighed and took a wistful bite of her sandwich.\n\nGina caught my befuddled expression. \u201cAlice has this theory\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIsh not a theowy,\u201d Alice said, mouth full. \u201cIsh weality.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe thinks they were physically attracted to each other,\u201d Gina continued. \u201cProbably had sex at some point. Made for a tricky working relationship.\u201d\n\nI burst into laughter. \u201cAre you crazy? Ethan *hated* Tom.\u201d\n\nGina passed Alice a napkin and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just saying.

Every boy in the school was chasing her.  A lot of them had already had her and wanted more.  She enjoyed teasing them.  It was all too easy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey say forbidden fruit is the finest.  After gorging herself on so much adoration, it was the only thing that Samantha could taste at all.  It was no surprise then that she found herself falling for the first boy who simply didn\u2019t seem to care about her.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt first she\u2019d assumed it was just because he thought he had no chance with her.  It was true of course, there was no way she\u2019d even bother speaking to a loser like him, she\u2019d thought.  It still irked her that he wouldn\u2019t even throw a glance her way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt annoyed her enough that she broke her cardinal rule and actually stooped to speaking to the little mouth breather.  She teased, she flirted, he barely looked up from his textbook.  He was getting good grades, it\u2019s not like he had anything else going for him.  He was distinctly average, no skills, no friends, nothing to make him at all noteworthy.  Yet he somehow thought he could ignore her advances?  This wasn\u2019t going to stand.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSubtlety went out the window as the months rolled past.  At first she\u2019d been worried that pursuing him would make her look bad in front of her friends.  By the end she didn\u2019t care, this was a point of pride for Samantha and she was going to break his resistance.  They mysteriously ended up in the same group for every project, she sat with him at lunch and tried to strike up conversation, shot him glances across the room and everything else she\u2019d ever read about in Cosmo.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRumours started to swirl around the school.  It didn\u2019t take a sharp eye to spot her pursuit of the poor little nerd.  Mixed with the level of envy that constantly swirled around Samantha\u2019s clique it made for an explosive scandal.  Everyone was talking about Samantha and her would-be paramour \u2013 everyone but he himself.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe shrugged off confessions, ignored thinly veiled propositions and just generally remained oblivious.  He had to be doing it on purpose, Samantha decided.  Well, if subtlety \u2013 what little she\u2019d exercised \u2013 didn\u2019t work, then maybe she\u2019d just come out and say it.  It was social suicide, but what had started as a minor annoyance had wormed its way deep enough into her insecurities that she no longer cared.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe cornered him behind the bike shed during their lunchbreak.  She\u2019d spent so much time sitting here with him, suggestively playing with the hem of her skirt and the buttons on her blouse while he stared at his goddamn textbooks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSamantha took a deep breath and prepared herself to throw away what little dignity she had left.

No one has been into Avatar since like, 2011. And how long did you spend on that weird blue alien costume anyways?\"\n\n\"Na'vi.\" The girl corrected him mechanically, reflexively.\n\n\"Okay, Na'vi -- whatever.

I mean, we didn't hang out and you share NO interests with me, but it was fine having you around the gang. Can't we just go back to that? Showing up in dirty storm trooper outfits isn't--\"\n\n\"Sand trooper.\" Again, the correction was automatic; mechanical and fast.\n\n\"Right, right. Sand troopers. Those are the ones from.. uh...\" Mark paused, his brain blanking on which Star Wars the trooper variant had first appeared in.\n\n\"A New Hope.\"\n\nSam supplied to answer so easily and smoothly that it caused Mark to pause, and he looked back at her blue, artfully done face with suspicion and a sudden spark of insight.\n\n\"Released?\" He queried.\n\n\"1977.\"\n\n\"Produced by?\"\n\n\"Gary Kutz, but Rick McCallum did the special edition.\"\n\n\"What was the character name for the opera singer in Fifth Element?\"\n\n\"Diva Plavalaguna.\"\n\n\"In what movie are ancient mythologies the result of alien interference in early human history?\"\n\nThere's a momentary pause now by Sam, but the lapse is fleeting before her eyes flash with challenge and she angles her chin at the boy standing in front of her defiantly.\n\n\"Stargate, 1994, directed by Roland Emm--\"\n\n\"WOW Sam! You're a total NERD!\"\n\nMark dissolved into a fit of wild laughter, and if her face hadn't been covered in paint he would have seen the furious blush that bloomed over Sam's pretty features. She shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as he regained his composure, leaning against the doorframe of his front door, wiping tears of humor from his eyes.\n\n\"Have you been HIDING that all these years?\"\n\nSam's mouth worked silently for a moment, trying to drudge up words stuck in her throat before she finally pushed them out past her lips.\n\n\"YES! Okay?! Are you happy? I-I like you so much because you like all the things I like! But my parents always said that Star Wars and Alien and Iron Man were things meant for boys, not pretty little girls in dresses. And then, well, then I was in cheerleading and they would have made fun of me! But when we graduated that all stopped mattering and I-I-I---!\"\n\nShe was near tears herself now, but not the same mirthful kind Mark had shed. Seeing this his features dropped into guilt and he pushed away from the door frame, tentatively laying a hand on her arm.\n\n\"Okay! Okay, I get it Sam. Come on; lets watch a movie or something. You're going to have to sit on a towel though, I don't want that blue stuff all over my couch.\"\n\n\"Thanks Mark. Really, thanks.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it, Sam. Like really, don't mention it.

The room looked enormous without all of my Marvel posters lining the walls and all of my books stacked on their shelves. All that remained was my twin bed & small desk.\n\nThe door rang cutting short my farewell to my stripped childhood abode. It was Ava dropping off my Calvin & Hobbes comics. There was no way I was going to head to Berkley & let her keep them. \n\nShe was fidgeting & wouldn't stop talking. She never stops talking. A few months ago she wouldn't even look me in the eyes if we passed each other in the hallways. But she hasn't left me alone since I started tutoring her in physics though. Tough shit. I didn't  care how much she batted her eyelashes at me. I never gave her a free class. Not a single one.\n\nShe was rambling more than usual. Something about Kelly Sherman's boyfriend or her dog. I'd clearly missed a vital part of the story because the next thing I know she suddenly blurts out, \"I'm in love with you.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I'm in love with you... I know it sounds crazy... But if you could just hear me out--\"\n\n\"Hear you out??? Ava. You've scorned me since eight grade. We've been neighbors since preschool. We were best friends until my dad was caught cheating with Principal Johnston and you considered me a social pariah. You told everyone that that was probably why I was valedictorian of our middle school class. You made fun of me because my mom had to use food stamps. I could go on for a good hour for chrissakes.\" She flinched.\n\n\"You can't hate me. Michael, you've been tutoring me for half a year. We spend every day together... You let me watch Return of the Jedi with you...\"\n\n\"Look. I'm sorry but I tutored you because it was good money for little work. And I let you watch movies with me sometimes because you lingered and I didn't want to be rude. I never thought you'd misconstrue it as mixed signals or something.\"\n\nShe looked like she was dealing with Bernoulli's equation. Out of impulse I almost snapped my fingers at her like I used to during our sessions when she'd zone out. \n\nThen she did the last thing I expected her to do. Shit. She started to tear up. Over me??? Ava Costa does not tear up over dudes. She eats them for breakfast. She's destined to be the ultimate trophy wife meets black widow. I did not have time for this.\n\n\"Look, I'm sorry. I'm moving cross country today anyways. It just wouldn't work.\" My taxi honked. \"I gotta go.\" She wiped the tears from her face as she looked up at me. She almost reminded me of my long lost best friend. The one who used to squeal when I'd climb up a tree too high. The one who wouldn't even be able to water ballon an elephant standing a foot in front of her. The one who bought me a piggy bank as my 10th bday present so we could \"invest\" into it for a year and have enough to buy ourselves Super Soakers our parents had prohibited. \n\nI picked my duffel bags from the floor and walked out, hoping I don't run into her during Christmas break. \n\n"], [221, "I looked around me, I was surrounded by filthy hands trying to grope what they can and disgusting mouths hanging open as they lay passed out on whatever they decided was close enough to a bed. I was only 17 but still I felt like I've already seen more of life than I would have wanted to. These parties I told myself I loved to go to just left me with a bitter after taste and a sour stomach. These people I used to call my friends just seemed empty.\n\n Michelle had promised me a spot in her bed but I realized I would have to spend the night cuddled up next to a pimpled jock after I saw Dennis and her go into her room together. I looked over my selection of beef pillows I could possibly rest my head on, most of them drooling and trying not to throw up in their sleep. The outside didn't seem all that frightening anymore and so I went outside. The walk home wouldn't be too far. I had walked home from Michelle several times in the past, never wearing 10 cm heels though. \n\n It was eerily quiet for a Saturday night. The moon had that beautiful look that it only gets when you're walking home alone and the stray cats seemed to think I was one of them as I walked past the alleys. I finally reached my neighborhood. I could see my house down the street, no light shining in the windows. The boy next door was standing on the driveway to his house, looking up to the sky. I knew his name. Pete Somethingson. I never bother with last names. I was the only kid on this street until he came along. It was about three years ago. \n\n-Hi, I said and walked towards him. He turned his gaze to me, away from the sky, and I think he could hear my gasp. This was the first time I saw his cold blue eyes, even in the dark and even though his thick dark curls hung over his face. I pulled his hair to the back of his ear. \n\n-Hello, he responded, uninterested. \n\n-What are you looking at? I asked, my drunken tongue stumbling on the words a bit. \n\n-Meteor shower. You can't really see much though. Because of the streetlights. \n\n-Oh, is it uh, fun? Or I mean, is it interesting? I said and took a crooked step in his direction. \n\n-Like I said, you can't really see much. I think I'll go inside, he said and abruptly turned his back to me. The door slammed before I even had a chance to tell him good night. \n \n\nI saw him in school the Monday that followed. I watched him through behind the books in the library. Many of the other students gave me looks, as if they were wondering what I was doing there. Maybe they were frightened. Why would one of the most popular girls in school hang around among the nerds if not to pull some sort of prank. But I couldn't stay away. I dreamed about his eyes all weekend. Those hungover days where you spend most of the time slipping in and out of naps, not sure what is real and what is yet another dream. His face was on repeat in my mind that hungover day. I couldn't stop wondering where is mind was at. Why wasn't he yearning to talk to me? Why did he spend all his time reading those books? Why didn't he seem to want friends? \n\n-Well, hello again, I said and plopped down in the seat opposite to him. I pulled out one of my text books even though I had no idea if we were actually using it in a class. \n\n-Hi, he said, not lifting his eyes from his book. \n\n-Dave? Richardsson asked me to give this to you, a pimpled kid said and handed Pete an envelope. \n\n-Dave? Who's Dave? I asked. \n\n-We've been neighbors for the last three years, don't you even know my name? Dave said and stood up. I felt my cheeks burn and I could feel the eyes of everyone on me. \n\n\n I waited for him by his locker, he looked annoyed when he saw me waiting for him. \n-Wait, Dave, I'm sorry. \n\n-Sorry? For what?\n \n-For not knowing your name, I said, my voice sounding unsure. \n\n-Why have you just now started to talk to me? He closed his locker and leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest. \n\n-Well, I uh, when I saw you the other day I realized I hadn't talked to you and like you said, we've been neighbors for three years now. I guess it's about time. Don't you? \n\n-It's about time we talked? That's your answer? His eyebrows were raised and he leaned forward. \n\n-Well, yeah. Don't you think so? My voice sounded uneven. I felt like I should have prepared something to say. \n\n-How can you just pretend like nothing has happened? Do you just want be to forget that you and your gang bullied me so much that I had to leave the state? I had to move back with my horrible mother just to get away from you. After a year of living with her I realized that I wouldn't let you or your friends ruin my life. I would never be able to look at myself in the mirror if I let you do that to me. I was very surprised when you didn't recognize me when I moved back though. But I guess getting rid of my glasses and a new haircut is enough for someone as self absorbed as you. \n He pulled up his backpack from the floor and left before I could say a word. \n\n\nEnglish isn't my first language so sorry for any grammatical errors or so "], [130, "'For the last time I am not going back to that game, I become addicted too easily' Daniel texted. The high school student sat in the back end of the lunch hall on a small table for two with his phone and lunch out in front of him.\n\nDaniel had no social group, he was nice enough but showed no interest in getting to know anyone at the school, not even the nerds with whom he shared interests with.\n\nHe had built a life out of the internet like so many before him and had grown into it. Whilst many would call it 'sad', he never felt sad. \n\nHe was content with his life for the time being but one person continuously made this difficult for him.\n\n\"Dan...\" the voice came from the girl sitting across from him.\n\n\"Yes Jennifer?\" asked Dan who put on his best fake smile, keeping his mannerisms in order.\n\n\"Can we please sit with other people? You need to speak to others.\" Jen gave him a concerned look and with her head gestured to her friends table.\n\nDan glanced towards the table with everyone on it glaring at him with disgust from the girls or with anger from the guys. \n\n\"Jen... I would want nothing more then for you to sit over there.\" Dan replied with a genuine smile on his face. Jennifer laughed at the *joke* and looked into his cold eyes.\n\n\"I couldn't leave you alone honey. You really do need some sort of social interaction at least once a day.\" Jen replied with another caring tone and grabbed his hand on his phone. Dan attempted to carefully remove her hand with his free one but this caused her to grip more tightly.\n\n\"I'm not in the mood to play today, or any other day really.\" Dan said back after successfully removing her grip of him. She then grabbed the same hand again with both of her hands and leaned over towards him.\n\n\"I'm not playing Dan, I am seriously becoming concerned.\" Dan looked straight back at her more forward attempts at connecting with him. Whispers became louder behind her as people were gossiping at her current behaviour. Dan gave a sigh and looked back at his phone.\n\n\"Are you sure I can't buy you out of your bet?\" Dan asked trying to type with his other arm.\n\n\"There is no bet, sweetie.\" she let go of his hand and took a bite out her sandwich, she licked her lips seductively as he glanced up. Dan closed his eyes, turned away and drew a deep breath before looking back at her with another fake smile.\n\n\"You know what *honey bun*... You win. I am going to snap now and give everyone a convincing performance for your entertainment.\" Jen's eyes widened as she brought her hand to her mouth, going slightly red as a giant grin appeared.\n\n\"You've finally called me by a pet name.\" she exclaimed.\n\n \"Go ahead and do whatever you want.\" Jen appeared to have not fully heard the rest. Dan gave an angry scowl and slammed his hand into the table.\n\n\"Listen Jen, I'm not trying to play hard to get nor am I being extremely shy nor am I extremely pissed off because someone spoiled yet another Game of Thrones plot point!\" Everyone who wasn't already looking at Dan immediately drew their eyes towards him, including the lunch monitors. Jen was taken aback in mild shock but then gave a subtle smirk as she had processed what was happening.\n\n\"Well one of those reasons was a lie because yes I am extremely shy when I'm talking to someone I actually like, emphasize on LIKE. I might've cared about Olivia's opinion this point last year because of the crush I had on her! Sorry Olivia for mentioning you in this but you have a cute and sweet factor about yourself that Jen here will never ever have and you deserve to know.\" \n\nDan looked out towards her and immediately back at Jen to avoid her reaction.\n\n\"Your attractiveness, Jen, will never be the defining quality for me, maybe I'm wrong, perhaps I am lying to myself, I really can't tell because I've made that a defining trait in my false reality which I hide myself in because I sometimes can't accept that I'm just like everyone else. But ignoring that possibility I simply don't need approval from the \"hot\" girl, especially you.\" \n\nJen crossed her arms and legs and sat their with a smile, soaking in the promised performance. Dan noticed her unfazed posture and face but was too committed to stop now.\n\n\"I'm 95% sure you're doing this for shits and giggles but, just for humour, let's say it's the 5% where you may actually be attracted to me... I don't think I ever \ncould be attracted to you because you are an undeniable bitch in which everything you ever get involved with...\" \n\nA chair scraping on the floor cut him off as a tall well built guy rose from his seat with a look of fury.\n\n\"The fuck did you say to her you fucking ne...\" The furious guy was shortly cut off by Dan who stared back at him with the same intensity.\n\n\"Shut the fuck up and sit down, Ted.\" Dan replied back. Ted pulled his chair back and began to walk around the table.\n\n\"Get the fuck over here you moth...\" Ted shouted over only he was stopped in his tracks by Jen who quickly rose from her seat and turned towards him.\n\n\"He said shut the fuck up and sit down Ted!\" Jen screamed at him.\n\n\"Jen... The hell are you doing? That little shit is fucking insulting you\" Ted's interruption continued as Jen gave him the death stare.\n\n\"Ted. You're not listening to me. I don't have to ruin your life like this Ted.\" Jen continued the stare down into his soul. Before Ted slowly backed into his chair in shock and disbelief.\n\n\"As you were saying sweetie?\" Jen went back into her previous position as Dan looked at her in realisation that she probably saved him from a near death experience. Dan regained some of his composure before continuing. \n\n\"See this right now, this manipulation attempt to get me to \"let you in\", or *genuine infatuation*, just furthers my point on why I really don't want to continue this relationship you believe we have going on. Another reason is... because I am running out of lines to say and none of this is actually \nphasing you whatsoever, is it?\" \n\nDan slumped back into his chair and slammed his face into the desk. The chatter resumed and everyone turned their attention to either Jen or Ted, who was still visibly shaking.\n\nJen got up from her seat, walked around to the distraught Dan and kneeled down besides him.\n\n\"I am really sorry honey, I can see your reasoning behind it, but that's why I really do love you.\" Dan pricked up at the word 'love' and turned away from her with a incredibly confused look.\n\n\"You always saw through me, you neither liked nor disliked me or whatever I did, you just didn't care about me in any way.\" Jen continued.\n\n\"Didn't you just hear me? I really do hate you now just like so many others.\" Dan still kept his head turned not wanting to look directly at her.\n\n\"Only recently though because I'm trying to talk to you. To get you to acknowledge me. Suddenly the boy who doesn't care now has to because I am disrupting his everyday life.\" Dan had started to realise what she had been attempting to do for the past few weeks.\n\n\"That speech certainly stunned me but it at least it shows that my efforts haven't been in vain.\" Jen stroked his hair and before Dan immediately slapped it off his head and sat up.\n\n\"...You... really... are good at mind games.\" Dan gave her a passive smile. Jen smiled as she stood back and walked back to her side of the table.\n\n\"That I am sweetie... But you're still not going to go out with me because of your stubbornness unfortunately. I'll smooth that off soon enough so in the meantime could you make this easier on us both and actually try to have a conversation with me. I'll speak to you soon, Daniel.\" \n\nShe blew him a kiss after she had collected her things and walked off with everyone still staring at her, Ted cringed as she walked past his table and profusely apologised.\n\n'Now I'm 100% sure she's manipulating me' Dan thought himself. \n\nIt took him a further 10 mins to get the recent events out of his mind before his phone quickly buzzed. Dan picked up to see had received text message from an unknown number.\n\n'did i mention i adore ur sister :) she really looks up to me and happily gave me ur #! Cant w8 4 our txt talks xD xxx Jen'\n\nDan looked at his phone with a blank face of emotion, his avenue of escapes from her was slowly shortening and he was becoming seriously worried about his well-being. Dan then reached into his wallet and took out a coin.\n\n'Heads I die by hanging myself, Tails I die by her hands' he flipped the coin into the air and let it land in front of him.

A thought of complaining came across Matt's mind, but instead he just fixed his glasses and sat down. Two more people showed up for the session, two less than anticipated, but Colin was ready to go.\n\n\"So, Stacy is new here and she wants to play an elf ranger...\"\n\n\"Like Legolas!\" She blurted with a giant smile aimed at Matthew. His lips tightened. \n\n\"Yes, that's right, like Legolas,\" Colin agreed.\n\n\"You see Matt, I know my Lords of the Ring,\" she winked at him oblivious to his wide eyes and steam coming out of his ears. \n\n\"However Stacy, Matt is also an elf ranger... Like Legolas,\" he said hopeful for a smile, but continued when it didn't come, \"so I thought it'd be better to diversify a little.\"\n\nShe put on a pout that could knock down anyone in their high-school, Colin included, but Matt put on a satisfied smirk. Then her face lit up.\n\n\"I can be that red-headed girl! Legolas' girlfriend! And you can be Legolas, Matt!\"\n\nHe sheepishly looked at Colin who looked back at him the same way.

Determined not to let the pretty girl die, Colin would redirect his bad throws and Matt was losing his patience. \n\n\"Okay, so the half-orc barbarian is here,\" he said pointing at a little figure.\n\n\"You don't have anymore arrows,\" Colin warned him. Matt sighed and massaged his scalp as he observer the board. He didn't have enough movement points to go around Stacy to engage the half-orc with his shortsword...\n\n\"I run,\" he said confidently while moving his little figure towards Stacy and the barbarian. \n\n\"My hero is coming to save me!\" Stacy squeaked at Matt while giving him the biggest teasing smile. His nostrils flared again, but other than that he ignored her.\n\n\"I jump on her shoulders,\" he said remembering well enough his sharpened cleats used for wood climbing, \"and jump on the half-orc, slicing his head in half,\" he finished with a grin ton an awe struck Stacy.\n\n\"That is so cool,\" she said in a very normal tone. Matt took the d20 and rolled.\n\n1.\n\n\"You fail the jump and knock Stacy down,\" Colin said. \"Stacy, your move.\"\n\n\"Is he still laying on top of me?\" she asked wide-eyed. \n\n\"Sure,\" Colin sighed.\n\n\"I want to talk to him,\" she said calmly.\n\n\"The half-orc?\" Colin asked while his eyebrows raised.\n\n\"No, Matt.\"\n\n\"You mean Thalmor.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Okay, what do you want to tell him?\"\n\n\"Thalmor, I think we need to be together.

She was lucky enough to possess the dangerous combination of good looks and great intelligence, causing those around her to almost naturally fall into place as her followers. \n\nDespite being as blessed as she was, Jess was not an arrogant person. If anything, she liked to take the back seat and observe those around her. She liked to figure out how people worked. What motivated them. Every time she believed she'd got the measure of someone, she'd try out her theory. If she was successful then she could add said person to her 'collection' - those who she believed she had power over.\n\nBoys were easy, and men even easier so. She could get a boys pulse racing and have him do any favour for her she wanted just by undoing her top button and flirting ever so slightly. She once got a man at her local store to straight-up buy her cigarettes just by smiling at him and giggling at everything he said. But that was far too easy.\n\nNo, Jess Brown wanted a new challenge. But who?\n\nThere wasn't a single boy from the 'popular group' she hadn't collected in her year, and there doesn't exist a word smith with enough skill to convince her to waste her time on a younger male.

Bingo. \n\nJess sat up in her chair as she surveyed him, like a predator hunting her prey. How would she approach him? What would she use to capture his attention? God, she loved this. The thrill of taking someone down. Using her natural gifts of beauty and brains to see if she could charm and seduce those around her. She didn't like to think like this, but a small part of her felt like she was superior to her peers. Like she was a goddess surrounded by mere mortals. Megan Cartwright, a normal looking girl who looked even more startlingly average when sat next to Jess was trying to engage her in a conversation. Jess ignored her. She didn't have time to listen to trivial gossip and she wasn't in the mood to have everyone's opinions on who was going to win this years *Britain's Got Talent*.\n\nHer mind was racing as she looked him up and down. His uniform seemed clean. She could see his shirt was tucked evenly into his trousers and his blazer fit him well. His trousers hitched up slightly as he walked and she noted his plain black socks underneath. She frowned slightly- he was giving very little away. She couldn't see much of his face, but his black hair seemed messy and almost like he'd not paid it much attention. Well, that was no use to her, half the boys in school were doing that these days. Then she spotted it, under his right arm he was carrying a book. A book to read at *lunch* time?\n\nHe's a nerd.\n\nShe had work to do.\n\nJess stood up, and walked over to where the new boy sat reading his book. He was alone. She smirked, this was a good sign for her. A lack of social skills suggests he's nervous or maybe even shy, meaning it was be easy for her to overwhelm him with (hopefully) some of her more basic methods of flattery. \n\nShe sat opposite him, and was slightly taken aback when he didn't immediately acknowledge her presence. Jessica Brown was not given to being ignored. Softly, she cleared her throat. The boy looked up, and she gasped.\n\nStaring back at her were a pair of eyes that held more depth and mystery than any which she had ever encountered before. They were dark, and shining. In that one moment which seemed to last forever, she saw *into him*. Intelligence, maturity, dignity, charisma... Jess was stunned. \n\nWithout even knowing what she was doing, her hand slowly moved up and she did up her top button. That would not work on him. A dry smile slowly stretched across his face.\n\n'Yes?' Was the only word he spoke.\n\nSuch brevity. Such confidence. He'd only spoken one word yet she felt like he'd just pelted her with a thousand. *Why are you here? What do you want? Can't you see I'm reading? Do you really think you can 'collect' me?'*\n\nWhat was *that?* Jess was flustered.\n\n'I.. uh... I just saw you sitting here and I- well, what's that you're reading?'\n\nHe paused in thought for a few moments before he replied, and for the first time in her life Jess felt the balance of power change. She gulped while she waited.\n\n'We both know you're not interested in my book, although that's a great shame. It's one of Dostoevsky's greatest pieces. I often find the lunch hall a great place to sit. You see, the library isn't for me. Too much hubbub, too many people bothering me, and if there's one thing I dislike, it's being bothered without reason...'\n\nHis eyes lingered over her as he spoke, and Jess had never felt so insignificant in her life.\n\n'Forgive me if I seem confrontational,' he continued 'but I think I know why you came over here. I won't be charmed by cleavage and a cute smile. So if there's nothing else...?' He gestured to her that he wanted to continue reading.\n\nJess knew when to cut her losses. The best thing she could do now was leave and think of a new way to approach him, the worst thing she could do would be to remain in her upset state and try to appease someone who appeared to see right through her. She was in a state of shock. This was perhaps the first time she'd ever approached a male who appeared utterly uninterested.\n\nJess stood up and left, catching her leg on the corner of the table and tripping slightly as she went. She heard a soft chuckle behind her.\n\n'What happened?' gushed Megan and the other girls at once.\n\n'You look a bit red, Jess.'\n\n'What did he say?'\n\n'Did he just look over here?'\n\nJess turned around in a whirl of anger. She could feel hot tears forming in her eyes, but she wouldn't show any weakness in front of these lot.\n\n'None of you are to talk to him, or to tell anyone what happened here. Understood?'\n\nSilenced, the group of girls solemnly nodded.\n\nAnd with that, Jess left the lunch hall.\n\nMeanwhile, the boy with black eyes deftly licked a finger, turned his page and continued reading. "], [28, "Dear Diary, Samantha here, \n\n\"Why wasn't he afraid?\" I mused over this, wondering why HE of all people could be so nonchalant over my boyfriends threats. Chance was one of the robotics kids at our school. Really, he was just a nobody. Then there\u2019s me, Samantha, queen bee of our high-school, cheerleader elite. I was dating Darren, the Quarterback and All-American.\n\nIt all started on that damn day when Darren and I were walking down the hall with some of his jock buddies. Honestly, I don't know what they were talking about really, but I just smiled and faked laughed as usual. I was looking back and making a comment to one of the boys when suddenly Darren started yelling. \n\n\"Watch where you\u2019re going dumbass.\" Darren snarled. In front of Darren was Chance. It looked like they had just bumped into one another. Chance, had dropped some books and was picking them up. Most guys (especially ones that looked like Chance, dark haired, glasses, and ill advised outfit) would have been quaking at the thought of Darren being angry at them, who is 6\u20194, 200 pounds of pure savory muscle. This time was different, Chance stood up as smoothly as he had bent down to pick up his books, and peered straight into Darren\u2019s eyes. \"Hey man didn't see you there, ill watch out next time.\" He said this just as calmly as he picked up his books while adjusting his brown spectacles. In an instant, I saw Darren make a move towards Chance. Knowing his temperament, I grabbed his arm quickly, \"He\u2019s not worth it baby, lets just go.\" Darren let up a little and looked back at Chance, who was just staring, not even caring he was about to get his ass-kicked. Darren breathed out, \"I\u2019ll catch you later you little shit.\" I gave Chance the I-just-saved-your-ass-nerd look. Then I strutted away with Darren on my arm. \n\nDear Diary, Chance here,\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with my code? I\u2019ve quadruple checked it already. I can\u2019t seem to figure out one of the last algorithms to help make smooth movement on the robot I've been working on. The robot is designed to help plant crops and diagnose levels of nutrients in the ground. Plus it's also meant to help aging farmers move around. I\u2019ve been working on this robot for years actually, I got the idea for it after I helped code a cost effective insulin pump for the poor (the idea came to me because my test subject was a farmer with diabetes). Anyway, my day actually became a lot more interesting because within this train of thought I was having about the algorithm, I ran into a much less metaphorical train.\n\n\"Watch where you\u2019re going dumbass.\" Snarled the high-school Quarterback Darren. A big oaf, whom I am sorry to say doesn't have the same intelligence as his size. As I was picking up my books, I noticed he was with his buddies and his girlfriend Samantha. Who as far as I was concerned, was queen bitch of our school. The truth is, Darren and his group didn't scare me at all. What these guys don't know about me is that I am the state\u2019s Golden Gloves silver-medalist in boxing's light heavy-weight division (courtesy of my mother pushing me, rest her soul). So, even if they were to try and fight me I'm pretty sure I actually had more real fight experience than all of them combined (and IQ too). My mother never wanted me to fight outside the ring, and always wanted me to be a good kid that focused on my studies and the needs of others. So instead, I just told him sorry, to which he retorted something stupider than he looks. His girlfriend pulled him away and gave me a look of contempt. Something which I mirrored back. I had no time for her kind of people. After that, I just continued onto the robotics lab, where I had more pressing issues to delve into.\n\nDear Diary, Samantha here,\n\nI find myself not being able to stop thinking about Chance all weekend. The way he was so calm when dealing with Darren peaked my interest him. So, this week, I found myself looking out the school yard, the halls, and classrooms to get a glance of Chance. Glance of Chance, ha that sounds so poetic. Anyway, this week I saw something that got to me that I made my stomach drop. \n\nI was walking by the robotics lab when I saw him there, sitting at the desk staring into his Macbook Pro. There were some other people around him and a girl that was sitting close, \"damn her\" I thought. Suddenly, I realized I was jealous. Not only was I jealous of another girl, it was over a nerd at our school. How could that be possible? Furthermore, that\u2019s not the thing that got me. Truth is, over the past week I have taken the long route to pass by the robotics lab to catch a glimpse of Chance. I noticed that he works tirelessly in school and after school to work on his projects. I started to become curious as to what he was actually working on. There was a girl sitting by me in one of my classes that works in the robotics club with Chance. I asked her casually what they were working on, not to give myself away. She said that they were working on devices to help improve the lives of people around them. \"What a joke!\" I found myself berating her. \"What makes you think that you can change anything?\" However, as I said this, all I felt was myself being more intrigued by Chance and a little guilt too. I blushed just thinking about him.\n\nFinally, on Friday of this week. I decided that I was gonna muster up the courage to talk to him. In spite of the possible repercussions it might have. Who knows? Maybe ill just ask him some stupid physics question to make it seem more natural? So finally, after third period I went walked towards the robotics center wondering what I would say to him. Right before I got into the door hit someone, Whack, I looked up and I saw bright brown glasses, and all I could muster was \n\n\"Hey.\" \n\nDear Diary, Chance here,\n\nI worked my butt off this week and have found myself really close to cracking the code. However, thats not really what I want to write about. This week I noticed something kind of strange. Every time that I am in the robotics lab I have started to see Samantha walk by the robotics window and peer in for a second, then she just shuffles away. I really don't understand it and wish she would just stop. I'm pretty sure she's just coming by to make fun of me or some of the people in robotics. It\u2019s getting pretty annoying. So I decided that the next time she would come by I would give her a piece of my mind. This Friday I would do it. \n\nSo when the time came after third period, (which is usually when she comes through) I saw her slowly walking by. This time she wasn't looking through the window but it seemed like she was muttering something to herself. No matter. I got up and walked to the door and opened it. Whack. She was much closer than I realized and as I opened the door I just ran myself into her by accident. She looked up at me with her big (now that I'm up closer) extremely beautiful blue eyes. I lost train of thought and just blurted out\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nNote: I noticed this story is getting long, please let me know if you guys like it so far!"], [18, "Not even a fictional piece, there are two people at my school exactly like this. I'll change names and make it dialoguey.\n\n--\n\nCassie sighed a deep sigh as she walked into Theatre II, first period. She looked over at CJ casually playing on his years-old 3DS. The sounds indicated he was playing at iteration of smash. \n\nShe sat two seats away from him as always, with Cade and Katherine between them. As Mrs. Garcia began calling roll, she silently waited for her name.\n\n\"Elizabeth Allison?\" \"Here.\"\n\n\"Cassie Britfield?\"\n\nCJ looked so cute in his TMNT jacket.\n\n\"CASSIE!\" \n\n\"HERE!\" she cried, startled.\n\nAs soon as roll finished, people automatically rose to go attend to final details. That afternoon, the class was headed to an elementary school to perform a children's play - a sort of CD, hopefully maturing into one or two theatre department members in four to nine years. Cassie was playing a bratty princess, and CJ a kind grandfather.\n\nMiraculously, she and CJ were both on set crew. She used this time to attempt to flirt; saying hi, asking about his interests, flipping her hair, the works. She knew she was gorgeous, but not in a self-centered way; she knew she had a good body and long, soft black hair. She just wished it mattered to CJ. NOTHING seemed to matter to him; did he even have a sex drive? \n\nThoughts of that had to be pushed out of her mind for now, there were set pieces to load up. After an hour of work, they were ready. A short drive to the elementary school later, they were setting up.\n\nDuring which, of course, CJ went back to playing on his DS. He was too adorable to disturb, so she went about the set setup herself. Following setup, the little kids filed into the cafetorium in neat lines under the tyrannical watch of early education majors. \n\nCJ was amazing in his performance, as always. Hidden beneath the hoodie and long, unkempt hair was a veritable acting genius. He made the kids laugh when he wanted them to laugh and they calmed when he wanted them quiet. As he came backstage once his parts were over, she congratulated him.\n\n\"Thanks, Cassie! You were great too!\" He replied, ever kind. He knew she liked him and so tried to be nice in the stead of romantic interest. It just hurt more. Two years of patient kindness, not one loving word or look in return. \n\nAfter the show ended and four hundred children were high-fived, striking the set was the next step. CJ thankfully worked diligently at this as opposed to setup and the work was going quickly until they crashed into each other on the tiny stage. Cassie fell backwards while CJ hit a wall and slid down it. Ever the closet gentleman, CJ scurried over to Cassie to make sure she was okay.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" He asked, worry on his face. \n\nCassie found it amusing that he still worried when it was a simple tumble. He had never been this close to her; he was directly above her, by maybe a foot. An irrational thought took her mind and she let it act out - she reached up, put her hand on the back of his neck, sat up on one elbow, and kissed him.\n\nThe rest of the day registers as a blur in Cassie's memory. She knows CJ screamed in surprised disgust and toppled backwards, hitting his head on a metal cart (causing yet another yell). People came to the scene and laughed. She sat in silence during the drive back and the drive home. It all merged together in a whir of laughter, yells, and green hoodies.\n\nAnd once she was home, she cried. \n\n---\n\nPlease note that this story is a somewhat dramatized account of an actual event. Names are changed as are certain chronological elements. \n\nFor those who may want to know what happened afterwards, CJ changed to a policy of avoidance of Cassie, which did nothing to affect her feelings. It's now about a calendar year later and she still likes him, and he still will have nothing to do with her. "], [15, "Jessica glanced up furtively, checking to make sure he was still there. Satisfied, she turned back to her Biology quiz and absently filled in the multiple choices. It didn't bother her that she would likely fail the test. Nothing bothered her anymore, except for the idea that she might lose Andy. This was the thought that kept her mind in a perpetual whirlwind of doubt and her body in a constant flurry of anxiety. She looked up again. Still there. Good.\n\nThe bell rung and Jessica forced herself to remain seated. It wouldn't do to be noticed, and in any case, Andy was still frantically scribbling. She bit into her lower lip, holding fast with anticipation until most of the class turned in their papers. As Andy began doing the same, Jessica stood up, forcing her tensely wooden body into a casual saunter. She tasted blood from her gnawed lip and quickly licked away. *Nothing out of the ordinary,* she thought.\n\nJessica maintained a safe distance from Andy, keeping her eyes downcast and relying on the self-graffiti'd skull and crossbones that adorned the sides of his black and white Chuck Taylors. Her chest swelled with a torrent of fire as she swallowed the urge to gaze up, to glance at his greasy, unkempt mane and slender, undefined physique. *I will have him soon enough*, she reminded herself.\n\nAndy reached the end of the hallway and paused at the heavy glass doors that led out of the building. Jessica drew a sharp breath and felt a momentary panic as he rested a hand on the handle, before turning to his right and entering the adjacent Men's Room. Jessica sighed, uttering a silent gratitude to whichever cruelly benevolent god had allowed this dance to go forward. Without so much as checking her surroundings, she followed him in.\n\nTwo boys were standing at the long row of urinals. One jumped back, furiously fumbling at his zipper, while the other several rows away just stared with an expression of confusion. \"Girl, this is the Men's Room, what the hell...\" Jessica fixed a withering gaze on both. \"Out,\" she snarled. Both shuffled quickly away, sliding with deliberate distance around Jessica and casting wary, sidelong glances at her as they left. She locked the door. It didn't matter who saw her, anymore.\n\nJessica began to walk past the row of stalls across from the urinals. Empty. Empty. Empty. She reached the last one at the end, next to the frosted glass window that led outside. She glanced down and breathed a deep, exhilarating sigh of relief. Skull and bones on black and white. The heady smell of cheap weed emanated from inside. Suddenly, a wave of panic rushed over her. *I haven't planned for this moment,* she realized. With the crushing fear that she would lose her nerve or run out of time, Jessica knocked impulsively on the stall door.\n\n\"Uh, it's occupied, asshole,\" came the annoyed response. She knocked again. Harder. \"What the fuck? Go away, man.\" Once more. She heard a shuffling of paper and plastic, followed by the toilet flushing and a quick succession of misty sprays. The door swung open with a snap, forcing Jessica to jump back. \"This is a violation of my human...\"\n\nShe stared at him for an eternal few seconds. His puffy, acne scarred face fell into a lithely bony frame, wrapped in an amalgam of black cloth, leather, and chains. For his part, Andy stared back, his features a wash of befuddlement and disbelief. *The calm before the storm,* thought Jessica, eager with anticipation. \"Who the hell...\" Andy began, and then his eyes went wide.\n\nJessica smiled, a huge grin that felt like it was going to fly off the sides of her face. \"You remember,\" she crooned. \"I...no, it was a mistake. Shit. I was stupid. I never meant for anything to happen.\" Jessica's face dropped into a scowl; an instantaneous transition that sent Andy several paces back into the stall. His hands grasped desperately at his sides, seeking traction or safety or *something* to stabilize his world. \"She was 12, you fucking pig,\" Jessica replied, a glistening edge emerging from her pocket."], [15, "\"You're just not my type\" those words, those goddamn words burned Alexis from the inside out, how could she not be \"his type\"!? It was absurd! \n\nWhat had begun almost a year prior as a dare by one of her friends to ask a nerd out in public had boiled into a full-blown obsession for her. The first time she asked him out it was in the school cafeteria, like any other boy in the school would she assumed he would burst out with a million cries of \"yes!\" Instead he merely scoffed and answered with a gruff \"fuck off\" he didn't even miss a beat, rejected her outright in a moment, all her insecurities she hid behind makeup, a nice car and a dozen boyfriends was shattered like thin glass in an instant. \n\nHer obsession began early, the week after his rejection she found his email address and from there was able to find his username on most major websites. She found his Skype username and under the name \"Becca\" had begun chatting to him, to find out what made him tick. \n\nWhat she learned was, behind his class daydreaming, his silent hours in the library reading comics and playing videogames, was someone with an intelligence and self awareness she never thought possible. Her friends who spent every weekend drunk, high and getting fucked seemed more fake by the day, she had grown so completely dissilusioned with them as the months dragged on. Before she had 4 \"main\" boyfriends she would be with, all the popular girls did it, and those popular guys, star athletes all did the same with a few girls. Soon each of them began simply dumping her, Kyle dropped her after she chose to watch \"under the red hood\" at home instead of going to Stevie's party, Saun grew cold after she spent her 300 dollars in birthday money on comics instead of sexy clothes and \"party supplies\" Darren stopped returning her calls, because she stopped calling him. She looked back at her life to see how empty it was. She had begun to focus more and more on her studies while her friends continued to party, and yet at school she maintained her air of popularity, shunning the nerds and hanging out only with the \"beautiful people\" yet her nights were consumed with her chatting to him online, she maintained her persona, she liked being Becca more than Alexis, Becca was so pure, accepting of her insecurities, a girl with dreams and ambition, a girl who had passion in her life, a passion for videogames, comics and batman cartoons, but she actually HAD a passion!\n\nAs the months went on, more and more people could see Alexis had fallen out with the \"beautiful people\" she had stopped wearing miniskirts and stopped going to the stylist, her friends dressed to the best all the time, yet Alexis had begun coming to school in t-shirts and jeans, her long dyed blonde hair had faded and had begun to return to its natural black... She had changed, changed so much, and it was thanks to him, who she talked to every day under a false name, who had enlightened her to the idea of self-awareness, who had awakened her to the joys of having even a simple passion in life which bought more rewarding feelings than a million parties or a billion boyfriends. \n\nThe day had finally come, she woke up at 4am to get herself looking as good as possible, her black hair was curled to bounce when she walked, all her imperfections were covered with makeup and she dressed in tight fitting woolen clothes, completely covering herself yet showing off her ideal figure, the day had come. \n\nShe found him outside the library \"hey, Michael, could I talk with you a moment?\" She asked, her heart racing and her legs almost shaking \"ugh, oh... Kay?\" Answered Michael nearvously, believing this to be a prank, yet he was curious, he wanted to see how they planned to \"get him\" \n\nHe followed her behind the Drama building, he crossed his arms \"okay Alexis, what is it?\" She took a deep breath, collecting herself \"Michael... I've been hoping to say this for awhile now, and... Please, just hear me out... I like you, I have for a long time, the parties and stuff are all so hollow, you have a passion, you think about your future... And I wanna be a part of that.. So what I'm saying is... Could we... Go out?... Together?\" \n\nMichael raised an eyebrow, putting his hands on his hips \"well see Alexis... Its just that... I've already kinda got feelings for someone else, and...\" Here it comes \"... And you're really not my type\" \n\nAs Alexis drove home from school she was FUMING! she bashed in her bedroom door, pulled her jewellery off and stormed into the bathroom to wipe the streaming makeup off her face... Her phone vibrated, a Skype message, from Michael to Becca... She opened it, and it read \"Hey Bec, listen I know this is out of the blue but something happened today that's kinda pushed me over the edge and I have to tell you... I've been having feelings for you awhile now-\" she closed the phone and say it down carefully... It made sense now, he only knew her, the REAL her, as Becca, not Alexis, she wiped away her tears and looked her reflection in the eyes. She had to win him, win him from herself, she looked down and closed her eyes \"alright... Square one, let's do this...\" "], [12, "Jonathan ran, his arms outstretched behind him, like the wings of a mighty bird of prey.  He flew through  the classroom leaping past desks and his classmates alike. He stopped at Billy's desk and karate chopped the papers and books onto the floor. Jonathan squealed in glee as he fled the scene at breakneck speed. \n\nIt was recess and only Billy remained at his desk going over See Jack Run over and over. For such a classical piece of literature Billy thought it was remarkably difficult to understand.  Billy took his time though, he was going to be smart, he was going to graduate and finally make the millions he had dreamt about his whole life. Billy knew he could achieve anything he set his mind to, so he set his sights on the books before him.\n\nJulie watched from across the room, surrounded by her usual gaggle of giggling girls and the occasional boy who managed to muster enough courage to try and actually talk to her.  She was queen bee, and the swarm of boys that buzzed around the room amused her. Julie knew that with a word, any of these boys would quit showing off and do whatever she asked. All of them except Billy.  She looked at Jonathan as he ran up to her to collect his reward; a small hug, and a smile that was thought to be a major factor of global warming by those blessed enough to receive one.  Jonathan tried to talk to her, but he was quickly dismissed by Julie's annoyed look. The girls closed ranks around Julie, scavenging Jonathans momentary attentiveness to boost their own standings.  The vultures, thought Julie, but only for a moment as she looked back at Billy struggling his way through Math now.  Julie mumbled to softly to herself, thinking of new schemes to once and for all have every person in the class recognize her greatness.  A small thought emerged in her pretty little head, if she could just have Billy, she would need anyone else.\n\nBilly sat in his usual chair at the front of the class, he had transferred a week ago, and was still completely oblivious to the social interactions of his classmates. That suited him well though, all Billy needed was his studies. If only that girl Julie would stop trying to get my attention, Billy thought. Once again another boy flew past knocking Billy's school supplies onto the floor.  Billy shook his head, he knew he was a bit bigger than the other kids, but Billy knew violence would only get him in trouble. He lowered his head back into the crevasse of his math book and tried to figure out why some numbers were so darn smug. Darn prime numbers, think their better than everyone else, Billy thought.\n\nShe had done all the classic moves; laughed at all his jokes, picked him for her group projects; she had even gone so far as to pinch AND punch him, in one day nonetheless. What else would it take to get Billy to notice her, Julie contemplated.  Finally she had had it, a week had passed and graduation was approaching quickly for Billy, she had to act fast.  With the help of her friends and lackeys, no one knew which they were, Julie created her grandest scheme yet.  She would make him love her even if she had to do so by force.  On the day of Billy's graduation Julie put on her cutest outfit and ran to class, she was determined to kiss him before he left. Everyone in the class knew her plan except the teacher and of course Billy himself. \n\nBilly knew something was wrong as he entered the classroom for his last time, he was finally moving on to the next grade.  As he walked through the door Julie leapt from the side and grasped his neck firmly in her arms as she went for her big moment, but Billy brought one hand around and stopped her lips cold with his oddly large palm. \n\nJulie was stunned, \"WHY\" she screamed. \"Why don't you like me\", she hadn't meant to be so loud, but the rejection shook her to the core.\n\nBilly stumbled back shocked, \"WHY\", he said incredulously. \"I'm 27 years old, that is WHY\" Billy whined.\n\nI haven't seen Billy in some time, but as his former teacher I do keep track of my students.  I hear Billy is doing quite well, something about a hotel chain. Very impressive stuff.  Julie never recovered from the incident.  I hear she became some kind of public relations director at a golf course, but the man she is with is just horrible, some ass named Shooter McGavin. I do hope she find someone better someday. Oh well, till next time, on stories from behind the teachers desk.\n"], [12, "That\u2019s the thing: rules are rules, and they don\u2019t get broken. It all feels a little like a John Hughes movie at the end of the day, doesn\u2019t it? The beautiful peoples club doesn\u2019t mix with the punks, who in turn don\u2019t even look at the nerds, who can\u2019t stand the metalheads, despite a shared interest in Iron Maiden. The BPC sometimes hangs with the smart kids, but the latter is generally too up its own ass for the former and they don\u2019t any deep friendships. \n\nSee? There are rules: you just don\u2019t mix with groups too far outside the personality of your own. A jock dating a metalhead? Never going to happen. A member of the BPC and a smart kid, maybe: at least they\u2019re both from rich families. So, what about a member of the BPC and a nerd? \n\nFor Emma, it started in that computer programming class. Her father, out of some overprotective push for her to \u201cbe ready for life,\u201d made her take it; otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be caught dead there. At first, she hated it like she hated everything else about her school day. Day after day, she sat there, unengaged, wanting to slam her laptop on the floor and storm out. \n\nThe first time she ever knowingly appreciated the beauty of any schoolwork was during the first group project, when she was paired with a boy named Thomas. He was obviously taken with programming; he knew the subject matter even before the teacher explained it and was only in the class for easy credit. His expertise and raw confidence helped her see the fun in the simple calendar app they designed together. He was funny to be around and inspiring to learn from. After that she was hooked on the class. \n\nThomas and Emma didn\u2019t speak much after the project. She kept thinking about him, though. It took some time, but she finally realized that she was not just happy about the \u201cA\u201d he helped her get on the project. She realized that she wanted Thomas. \n\nHe was different than the boys she was used to hanging out with. The preening jocks and the cocky sons of lawyers were all, underneath their muscles and expensive clothes, insecure little boys. Thomas, on the other hand, possessed more manly confidence. When he looked at her, his gaze was unwavering, the cadence of his voice calm. Not a single boy in the BPC acted this way. \n\nThomas was a completely new experience for Emma. After processing her feelings, she could not look at the males in the BPC the same way anymore. She realized that her feelings for those boys were out of social obligation, not actual attraction. She fell for Thomas, and resolved to make him hers. He was a nerd, so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard, right?\n\nThe first time Emma texted Thomas, instead of attraction, he felt mild annoyance.\n\n\u201cHey! I have a question about coding class\u2026 do you mind meeting me to help?\u201d\n\nHe was in the middle of focused coding for a website he was building, and his close friends knew not to bother him right now. So when he did answer, several hours later, it was curt.  \n\n\u201cOk.\u201d\n\nThey ended up meeting at a coffee shop, where the fa\u00e7ade quickly fell away. Thomas quickly answered Emma\u2019s one or two basic questions about coding. The rest of the time was filled by Emma\u2019s strained flirting and Thomas\u2019 polite, but uninterested, replies. They left after only thirty minutes, both feeling awkward about the meeting. \n\nWhen Thomas returned home, he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around what just happened. He recognized Emma\u2019s behavior as flirting, but could not divine her motives. Emma was classically, painfully beautiful. This rendered her constantly surrounded by boys of the BPC, all vying for her attention. \u201cShe must want another \u2018A\u2019 on the next group project,\u201d he thought. \u201cMary\u2019s gonna love this!\u201d\n\nThomas, being an avid programmer, put little personal information on the internet. This included his relationship status, which was \u201cspoken for.\u201d When Thomas told Mary of Emma\u2019s manufactured tutoring session, Mary agreed that Emma was flirting. Mary suggested, however, that Emma\u2019s motives might be romantic instead of scholastic. At the mere suggestion, Thomas ridiculed Emma- her seemingly vacuous personality, her social climbing, and her trying to be someone she wasn\u2019t. Thomas kept going, oblivious to his cruelty toward another human. Mary quickly made Thomas stop; beating a dead horse was not Mary\u2019s style. \n\nThomas\u2019 relationship status was quite a shock for Emma the next day when she saw Mary and Thomas together in the parking lot after school. Emma had finally worked up the courage to talk to Thomas. She wanted to chat with him, to just enjoy his company. She rushed away at the sight of Thomas and Mary holding hands. Thomas never spotted her, thank goodness. He was still feeling superior and might have relayed as much to Emma. \n\nEmma and Thomas did not work together on the next group project in coding class, nor did they speak to one another for the rest of high school. They drifted separately through their senior year unaware that life gives us plenty of chances for reinvention. Emma was already in the process of hers; she knew she wanted to study programming in college, and was feeling strangely pleased by the arched eyebrows her interest in programming spurred among the members of the BPC. Eventually they both became complex adults- both interesting mixes of stereotypically opposing interests, both just following their hearts. \n\n"], [4, "\"Emily, Look.

Yet it was the reason I live. It\u2019s the reason why I continued going to school despite the ridicule, the rumours, and the bullying. The reason why I did my best in my academics, the only thing I\u2019ve got going for me. The reason why I turned my back on my precious hobbies, which are kept and sealed away. All of that, just to repair the relationship that was destroyed. Just so I could reach the upper echelons of the school society so that we could be equals. Just so I could be worthy.\n\nYet my only reward was silence. Utter silence.\n\nI peered into the bag. Sure enough, it has books, DVDs and lots of them. But it is not the full collection.

I deeply understand that fact. \n\nMy eyes are fixed on a frail-looking girl. The same girl who walked away when I needed her the most.

It still irked her that he wouldn\u2019t even throw a glance her way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt annoyed her enough that she broke her cardinal rule and actually stooped to speaking to the little mouth breather.  She teased, she flirted, he barely looked up from his textbook.  He was getting good grades, it\u2019s not like he had anything else going for him.  He was distinctly average, no skills, no friends, nothing to make him at all noteworthy.  Yet he somehow thought he could ignore her advances?  This wasn\u2019t going to stand.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSubtlety went out the window as the months rolled past.  At first she\u2019d been worried that pursuing him would make her look bad in front of her friends.  By the end she didn\u2019t care, this was a point of pride for Samantha and she was going to break his resistance.  They mysteriously ended up in the same group for every project, she sat with him at lunch and tried to strike up conversation, shot him glances across the room and everything else she\u2019d ever read about in Cosmo.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRumours started to swirl around the school.  It didn\u2019t take a sharp eye to spot her pursuit of the poor little nerd.  Mixed with the level of envy that constantly swirled around Samantha\u2019s clique it made for an explosive scandal.  Everyone was talking about Samantha and her would-be paramour \u2013 everyone but he himself.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe shrugged off confessions, ignored thinly veiled propositions and just generally remained oblivious.  He had to be doing it on purpose, Samantha decided.  Well, if subtlety \u2013 what little she\u2019d exercised \u2013 didn\u2019t work, then maybe she\u2019d just come out and say it.  It was social suicide, but what had started as a minor annoyance had wormed its way deep enough into her insecurities that she no longer cared.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe cornered him behind the bike shed during their lunchbreak.  She\u2019d spent so much time sitting here with him, suggestively playing with the hem of her skirt and the buttons on her blouse while he stared at his goddamn textbooks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSamantha took a deep breath and prepared herself to throw away what little dignity she had left.  This had gone on far too long.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cSo, you know how prom\u2019s coming up?\u201d she asked, twirling a loose hair around her finger as she smiled coquettishly at the only man who\u2019d ever resisted her substantial charms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d he croaked.  Even his voice was awkward.  It was absurd that he wouldn\u2019t leap at the chance to get with this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a date, do you?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cUgggh, no.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cSo maybe we should go together.  I think you\u2019re super cute.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cEr, Samantha, I\u2026\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cYou will!\u201d she excitedly finished the sentence for him, \u201cgreat!  You can pick me up at six.  I\u2019m going to wear pink, so pick a tux that compliments it, ok?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cUggh, Samantha, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m gay,\u201d he finished with an apologetic shrug at the crestfallen cheerleader.\n\n\n\n-----------------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Check out more of my writing at my subreddit]( https://www.reddit.com/r/herd_of_birds)\n", "id": "d3nxspm"}, {"comment": "It is a really good story but if you don't mind me saying, the gay thing kinda cheapens it.

I was only 17 but still I felt like I've already seen more of life than I would have wanted to. These parties I told myself I loved to go to just left me with a bitter after taste and a sour stomach. These people I used to call my friends just seemed empty.\n\n Michelle had promised me a spot in her bed but I realized I would have to spend the night cuddled up next to a pimpled jock after I saw Dennis and her go into her room together. I looked over my selection of beef pillows I could possibly rest my head on, most of them drooling and trying not to throw up in their sleep. The outside didn't seem all that frightening anymore and so I went outside. The walk home wouldn't be too far. I had walked home from Michelle several times in the past, never wearing 10 cm heels though. \n\n It was eerily quiet for a Saturday night. The moon had that beautiful look that it only gets when you're walking home alone and the stray cats seemed to think I was one of them as I walked past the alleys. I finally reached my neighborhood. I could see my house down the street, no light shining in the windows. The boy next door was standing on the driveway to his house, looking up to the sky. I knew his name. Pete Somethingson. I never bother with last names. I was the only kid on this street until he came along. It was about three years ago. \n\n-Hi, I said and walked towards him. He turned his gaze to me, away from the sky, and I think he could hear my gasp. This was the first time I saw his cold blue eyes, even in the dark and even though his thick dark curls hung over his face. I pulled his hair to the back of his ear. \n\n-Hello, he responded, uninterested. \n\n-What are you looking at? I asked, my drunken tongue stumbling on the words a bit. \n\n-Meteor shower. You can't really see much though. Because of the streetlights. \n\n-Oh, is it uh, fun? Or I mean, is it interesting? I said and took a crooked step in his direction. \n\n-Like I said, you can't really see much. I think I'll go inside, he said and abruptly turned his back to me. The door slammed before I even had a chance to tell him good night. \n \n\nI saw him in school the Monday that followed. I watched him through behind the books in the library. Many of the other students gave me looks, as if they were wondering what I was doing there. Maybe they were frightened. Why would one of the most popular girls in school hang around among the nerds if not to pull some sort of prank. But I couldn't stay away. I dreamed about his eyes all weekend. Those hungover days where you spend most of the time slipping in and out of naps, not sure what is real and what is yet another dream. His face was on repeat in my mind that hungover day. I couldn't stop wondering where is mind was at. Why wasn't he yearning to talk to me? Why did he spend all his time reading those books? Why didn't he seem to want friends? \n\n-Well, hello again, I said and plopped down in the seat opposite to him. I pulled out one of my text books even though I had no idea if we were actually using it in a class. \n\n-Hi, he said, not lifting his eyes from his book. \n\n-Dave? Richardsson asked me to give this to you, a pimpled kid said and handed Pete an envelope. \n\n-Dave? Who's Dave? I asked. \n\n-We've been neighbors for the last three years, don't you even know my name? Dave said and stood up. I felt my cheeks burn and I could feel the eyes of everyone on me. \n\n\n I waited for him by his locker, he looked annoyed when he saw me waiting for him. \n-Wait, Dave, I'm sorry. \n\n-Sorry? For what?\n \n-For not knowing your name, I said, my voice sounding unsure. \n\n-Why have you just now started to talk to me? He closed his locker and leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest. \n\n-Well, I uh, when I saw you the other day I realized I hadn't talked to you and like you said, we've been neighbors for three years now. I guess it's about time. Don't you? \n\n-It's about time we talked? That's your answer? His eyebrows were raised and he leaned forward. \n\n-Well, yeah. Don't you think so? My voice sounded uneven. I felt like I should have prepared something to say. \n\n-How can you just pretend like nothing has happened? Do you just want be to forget that you and your gang bullied me so much that I had to leave the state? I had to move back with my horrible mother just to get away from you. After a year of living with her I realized that I wouldn't let you or your friends ruin my life. I would never be able to look at myself in the mirror if I let you do that to me. I was very surprised when you didn't recognize me when I moved back though. But I guess getting rid of my glasses and a new haircut is enough for someone as self absorbed as you. \n He pulled up his backpack from the floor and left before I could say a word. \n\n\nEnglish isn't my first language so sorry for any grammatical errors or so ", "id": "d3o60sk"}, {"comment": "This is great!

The high school student sat in the back end of the lunch hall on a small table for two with his phone and lunch out in front of him.\n\nDaniel had no social group, he was nice enough but showed no interest in getting to know anyone at the school, not even the nerds with whom he shared interests with.\n\nHe had built a life out of the internet like so many before him and had grown into it. Whilst many would call it 'sad', he never felt sad. \n\nHe was content with his life for the time being but one person continuously made this difficult for him.\n\n\"Dan...\" the voice came from the girl sitting across from him.\n\n\"Yes Jennifer?\" asked Dan who put on his best fake smile, keeping his mannerisms in order.\n\n\"Can we please sit with other people? You need to speak to others.\" Jen gave him a concerned look and with her head gestured to her friends table.\n\nDan glanced towards the table with everyone on it glaring at him with disgust from the girls or with anger from the guys. \n\n\"Jen... I would want nothing more then for you to sit over there.\" Dan replied with a genuine smile on his face. Jennifer laughed at the *joke* and looked into his cold eyes.\n\n\"I couldn't leave you alone honey. You really do need some sort of social interaction at least once a day.\" Jen replied with another caring tone and grabbed his hand on his phone. Dan attempted to carefully remove her hand with his free one but this caused her to grip more tightly.\n\n\"I'm not in the mood to play today, or any other day really.\" Dan said back after successfully removing her grip of him. She then grabbed the same hand again with both of her hands and leaned over towards him.\n\n\"I'm not playing Dan, I am seriously becoming concerned.\" Dan looked straight back at her more forward attempts at connecting with him. Whispers became louder behind her as people were gossiping at her current behaviour. Dan gave a sigh and looked back at his phone.\n\n\"Are you sure I can't buy you out of your bet?\" Dan asked trying to type with his other arm.\n\n\"There is no bet, sweetie.\" she let go of his hand and took a bite out her sandwich, she licked her lips seductively as he glanced up. Dan closed his eyes, turned away and drew a deep breath before looking back at her with another fake smile.\n\n\"You know what *honey bun*... You win. I am going to snap now and give everyone a convincing performance for your entertainment.\" Jen's eyes widened as she brought her hand to her mouth, going slightly red as a giant grin appeared.\n\n\"You've finally called me by a pet name.\" she exclaimed.\n\n \"Go ahead and do whatever you want.\" Jen appeared to have not fully heard the rest. Dan gave an angry scowl and slammed his hand into the table.\n\n\"Listen Jen, I'm not trying to play hard to get nor am I being extremely shy nor am I extremely pissed off because someone spoiled yet another Game of Thrones plot point!\" Everyone who wasn't already looking at Dan immediately drew their eyes towards him, including the lunch monitors. Jen was taken aback in mild shock but then gave a subtle smirk as she had processed what was happening.\n\n\"Well one of those reasons was a lie because yes I am extremely shy when I'm talking to someone I actually like, emphasize on LIKE. I might've cared about Olivia's opinion this point last year because of the crush I had on her! Sorry Olivia for mentioning you in this but you have a cute and sweet factor about yourself that Jen here will never ever have and you deserve to know.\" \n\nDan looked out towards her and immediately back at Jen to avoid her reaction.\n\n\"Your attractiveness, Jen, will never be the defining quality for me, maybe I'm wrong, perhaps I am lying to myself, I really can't tell because I've made that a defining trait in my false reality which I hide myself in because I sometimes can't accept that I'm just like everyone else. But ignoring that possibility I simply don't need approval from the \"hot\" girl, especially you.\" \n\nJen crossed her arms and legs and sat their with a smile, soaking in the promised performance. Dan noticed her unfazed posture and face but was too committed to stop now.\n\n\"I'm 95% sure you're doing this for shits and giggles but, just for humour, let's say it's the 5% where you may actually be attracted to me... I don't think I ever \ncould be attracted to you because you are an undeniable bitch in which everything you ever get involved with...\" \n\nA chair scraping on the floor cut him off as a tall well built guy rose from his seat with a look of fury.\n\n\"The fuck did you say to her you fucking ne...\" The furious guy was shortly cut off by Dan who stared back at him with the same intensity.\n\n\"Shut the fuck up and sit down, Ted.\" Dan replied back. Ted pulled his chair back and began to walk around the table.\n\n\"Get the fuck over here you moth...\" Ted shouted over only he was stopped in his tracks by Jen who quickly rose from her seat and turned towards him.\n\n\"He said shut the fuck up and sit down Ted!\" Jen screamed at him.\n\n\"Jen... The hell are you doing? That little shit is fucking insulting you\" Ted's interruption continued as Jen gave him the death stare.\n\n\"Ted. You're not listening to me. I don't have to ruin your life like this Ted.\" Jen continued the stare down into his soul. Before Ted slowly backed into his chair in shock and disbelief.\n\n\"As you were saying sweetie?\" Jen went back into her previous position as Dan looked at her in realisation that she probably saved him from a near death experience. Dan regained some of his composure before continuing. \n\n\"See this right now, this manipulation attempt to get me to \"let you in\", or *genuine infatuation*, just furthers my point on why I really don't want to continue this relationship you believe we have going on. Another reason is... because I am running out of lines to say and none of this is actually \nphasing you whatsoever, is it?\" \n\nDan slumped back into his chair and slammed his face into the desk. The chatter resumed and everyone turned their attention to either Jen or Ted, who was still visibly shaking.\n\nJen got up from her seat, walked around to the distraught Dan and kneeled down besides him.\n\n\"I am really sorry honey, I can see your reasoning behind it, but that's why I really do love you.\" Dan pricked up at the word 'love' and turned away from her with a incredibly confused look.\n\n\"You always saw through me, you neither liked nor disliked me or whatever I did, you just didn't care about me in any way.\" Jen continued.\n\n\"Didn't you just hear me? I really do hate you now just like so many others.\" Dan still kept his head turned not wanting to look directly at her.\n\n\"Only recently though because I'm trying to talk to you. To get you to acknowledge me. Suddenly the boy who doesn't care now has to because I am disrupting his everyday life.\" Dan had started to realise what she had been attempting to do for the past few weeks.\n\n\"That speech certainly stunned me but it at least it shows that my efforts haven't been in vain.\" Jen stroked his hair and before Dan immediately slapped it off his head and sat up.\n\n\"...You... really... are good at mind games.\" Dan gave her a passive smile. Jen smiled as she stood back and walked back to her side of the table.\n\n\"That I am sweetie... But you're still not going to go out with me because of your stubbornness unfortunately. I'll smooth that off soon enough so in the meantime could you make this easier on us both and actually try to have a conversation with me. I'll speak to you soon, Daniel.\" \n\nShe blew him a kiss after she had collected her things and walked off with everyone still staring at her, Ted cringed as she walked past his table and profusely apologised.\n\n'Now I'm 100% sure she's manipulating me' Dan thought himself. \n\nIt took him a further 10 mins to get the recent events out of his mind before his phone quickly buzzed. Dan picked up to see had received text message from an unknown number.\n\n'did i mention i adore ur sister :) she really looks up to me and happily gave me ur #! Cant w8 4 our txt talks xD xxx Jen'\n\nDan looked at his phone with a blank face of emotion, his avenue of escapes from her was slowly shortening and he was becoming seriously worried about his well-being. Dan then reached into his wallet and took out a coin.\n\n'Heads I die by hanging myself, Tails I die by her hands' he flipped the coin into the air and let it land in front of him. He stared across the room not even glancing at the coin and muttered to himself.\n\n\"Our kids are going to be great politicians.\"", "id": "d3ob0el"}, {"comment": "11/10.

A thought of complaining came across Matt's mind, but instead he just fixed his glasses and sat down. Two more people showed up for the session, two less than anticipated, but Colin was ready to go.\n\n\"So, Stacy is new here and she wants to play an elf ranger...\"\n\n\"Like Legolas!\" She blurted with a giant smile aimed at Matthew. His lips tightened. \n\n\"Yes, that's right, like Legolas,\" Colin agreed.\n\n\"You see Matt, I know my Lords of the Ring,\" she winked at him oblivious to his wide eyes and steam coming out of his ears. \n\n\"However Stacy, Matt is also an elf ranger... Like Legolas,\" he said hopeful for a smile, but continued when it didn't come, \"so I thought it'd be better to diversify a little.\"\n\nShe put on a pout that could knock down anyone in their high-school, Colin included, but Matt put on a satisfied smirk. Then her face lit up.\n\n\"I can be that red-headed girl! Legolas' girlfriend! And you can be Legolas, Matt!\"\n\nHe sheepishly looked at Colin who looked back at him the same way.

Can I be Stacy?\" \n\n\"You already are,\" Colin said in what he thought was a charming way, yet it came off a bit creepy.\n\n\"Sure,\" she agreed while trying to catch Matt's eyes.\n\nAn hour or so later, Matt has developed a tactic in their combat - he'd always position himself behind Stacy hoping a bad dice roll would accidentally kill her. Determined not to let the pretty girl die, Colin would redirect his bad throws and Matt was losing his patience. \n\n\"Okay, so the half-orc barbarian is here,\" he said pointing at a little figure.\n\n\"You don't have anymore arrows,\" Colin warned him. Matt sighed and massaged his scalp as he observer the board. He didn't have enough movement points to go around Stacy to engage the half-orc with his shortsword...\n\n\"I run,\" he said confidently while moving his little figure towards Stacy and the barbarian. \n\n\"My hero is coming to save me!\" Stacy squeaked at Matt while giving him the biggest teasing smile. His nostrils flared again, but other than that he ignored her.\n\n\"I jump on her shoulders,\" he said remembering well enough his sharpened cleats used for wood climbing, \"and jump on the half-orc, slicing his head in half,\" he finished with a grin ton an awe struck Stacy.\n\n\"That is so cool,\" she said in a very normal tone. Matt took the d20 and rolled.\n\n1.\n\n\"You fail the jump and knock Stacy down,\" Colin said. \"Stacy, your move.\"\n\n\"Is he still laying on top of me?\" she asked wide-eyed. \n\n\"Sure,\" Colin sighed.\n\n\"I want to talk to him,\" she said calmly.\n\n\"The half-orc?\" Colin asked while his eyebrows raised.\n\n\"No, Matt.\"\n\n\"You mean Thalmor.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Okay, what do you want to tell him?\"\n\n\"Thalmor, I think we need to be together.

She was lucky enough to possess the dangerous combination of good looks and great intelligence, causing those around her to almost naturally fall into place as her followers. \n\nDespite being as blessed as she was, Jess was not an arrogant person. If anything, she liked to take the back seat and observe those around her. She liked to figure out how people worked. What motivated them. Every time she believed she'd got the measure of someone, she'd try out her theory. If she was successful then she could add said person to her 'collection' - those who she believed she had power over.\n\nBoys were easy, and men even easier so. She could get a boys pulse racing and have him do any favour for her she wanted just by undoing her top button and flirting ever so slightly. She once got a man at her local store to straight-up buy her cigarettes just by smiling at him and giggling at everything he said. But that was far too easy.\n\nNo, Jess Brown wanted a new challenge. But who?\n\nThere wasn't a single boy from the 'popular group' she hadn't collected in her year, and there doesn't exist a word smith with enough skill to convince her to waste her time on a younger male. As she sat in the lunch hall, absent mindedly picking at a bright red apple, she saw a boy walk past. A boy who she hadn't seen before. Bingo. \n\nJess sat up in her chair as she surveyed him, like a predator hunting her prey. How would she approach him? What would she use to capture his attention? God, she loved this. The thrill of taking someone down. Using her natural gifts of beauty and brains to see if she could charm and seduce those around her. She didn't like to think like this, but a small part of her felt like she was superior to her peers. Like she was a goddess surrounded by mere mortals. Megan Cartwright, a normal looking girl who looked even more startlingly average when sat next to Jess was trying to engage her in a conversation. Jess ignored her. She didn't have time to listen to trivial gossip and she wasn't in the mood to have everyone's opinions on who was going to win this years *Britain's Got Talent*.\n\nHer mind was racing as she looked him up and down. His uniform seemed clean. She could see his shirt was tucked evenly into his trousers and his blazer fit him well. His trousers hitched up slightly as he walked and she noted his plain black socks underneath. She frowned slightly- he was giving very little away. She couldn't see much of his face, but his black hair seemed messy and almost like he'd not paid it much attention. Well, that was no use to her, half the boys in school were doing that these days. Then she spotted it, under his right arm he was carrying a book. A book to read at *lunch* time?\n\nHe's a nerd.\n\nShe had work to do.\n\nJess stood up, and walked over to where the new boy sat reading his book. He was alone. She smirked, this was a good sign for her. A lack of social skills suggests he's nervous or maybe even shy, meaning it was be easy for her to overwhelm him with (hopefully) some of her more basic methods of flattery. \n\nShe sat opposite him, and was slightly taken aback when he didn't immediately acknowledge her presence. Jessica Brown was not given to being ignored. Softly, she cleared her throat. The boy looked up, and she gasped.\n\nStaring back at her were a pair of eyes that held more depth and mystery than any which she had ever encountered before. They were dark, and shining. In that one moment which seemed to last forever, she saw *into him*. Intelligence, maturity, dignity, charisma... Jess was stunned. \n\nWithout even knowing what she was doing, her hand slowly moved up and she did up her top button. That would not work on him. A dry smile slowly stretched across his face.\n\n'Yes?' Was the only word he spoke.\n\nSuch brevity. Such confidence. He'd only spoken one word yet she felt like he'd just pelted her with a thousand. *Why are you here? What do you want? Can't you see I'm reading? Do you really think you can 'collect' me?'*\n\nWhat was *that?* Jess was flustered.\n\n'I.. uh... I just saw you sitting here and I- well, what's that you're reading?'\n\nHe paused in thought for a few moments before he replied, and for the first time in her life Jess felt the balance of power change. She gulped while she waited.\n\n'We both know you're not interested in my book, although that's a great shame. It's one of Dostoevsky's greatest pieces. I often find the lunch hall a great place to sit. You see, the library isn't for me. Too much hubbub, too many people bothering me, and if there's one thing I dislike, it's being bothered without reason...'\n\nHis eyes lingered over her as he spoke, and Jess had never felt so insignificant in her life.\n\n'Forgive me if I seem confrontational,' he continued 'but I think I know why you came over here. I won't be charmed by cleavage and a cute smile. So if there's nothing else...?' He gestured to her that he wanted to continue reading.\n\nJess knew when to cut her losses. The best thing she could do now was leave and think of a new way to approach him, the worst thing she could do would be to remain in her upset state and try to appease someone who appeared to see right through her. She was in a state of shock. This was perhaps the first time she'd ever approached a male who appeared utterly uninterested.\n\nJess stood up and left, catching her leg on the corner of the table and tripping slightly as she went. She heard a soft chuckle behind her.\n\n'What happened?' gushed Megan and the other girls at once.\n\n'You look a bit red, Jess.'\n\n'What did he say?'\n\n'Did he just look over here?'\n\nJess turned around in a whirl of anger. She could feel hot tears forming in her eyes, but she wouldn't show any weakness in front of these lot.\n\n'None of you are to talk to him, or to tell anyone what happened here. Understood?'\n\nSilenced, the group of girls solemnly nodded.\n\nAnd with that, Jess left the lunch hall.\n\nMeanwhile, the boy with black eyes deftly licked a finger, turned his page and continued reading. ", "id": "d3oho8m"}, {"comment": "**PART 2**\n\nA week had passed since the first encounter. In that time Jess had felt a range of emotions that she'd never experienced before. She'd been hurt and embarrassed, but it didn't take long for the pain to turn into anger. Hot, red seeping anger. The kind of anger that spawns in the pit of your stomach and then churns this way and that, like an angry being thrust into a world where it does not belong. Just *who* does he think he is?\n\nShe sat in front of the mirror, looking at herself. Her bright blue eyes were clear and piercing, beneath sat a pair of full, even lips. She had shiny brunette hair that seemed to dance and glisten even when completely motionless. She turned her head this way and that trying to find a flaw, but alas, she was perfect from every angle. \n\nThis only angered her more. *Why* isn't he attracted to me then?\nWhat else can I possibly do?  She thought and thought, racking her brains. If he's not shallow enough to fall for my looks, then that must mean he wants something else from me. \n\nHe's clearly intelligent, she thought. I'll have to try and stimulate him on an intellectual level. That was fine with her. She was clever also, although she felt slightly annoyed. She felt like she shouldn't have to resort to this when she had a face that would make Aphrodite jealous.  \n\n**Monday**\n\nJess arrived at form and like usual her presence caused the other girls to stop what they were doing and acknowledge her.\n\n'How did you get your hair that straight?'\n\n'Straighteners, Megan' came her curt response. \n\nJess was focused on what she had to do later on, and was in no mood for niceties. While the other girls chatted away about this and that, Jess looked around the class. The nerds, the jocks, the footballers, the smokers. All of them seemed so insignificant to her, like they didn't even exist.\n\nThe day passed by in a blur, at lunch Jess sat herself in the corner of the hall, so she could see every single person pass through. She waited and waited but he didn't come, just when she thought she'd have to go looking for him she heard the girls suddenly giggling. \n\nThere he was, at the end of the hall. And he was talking to someone. Another girl. Jess felt the room shrinking around her, and she suddenly became aware of whispers from her group of friends.\n\n'You're red again, Jess.'\n\n'Just go over there, he's bound to drop *her* for you, look at the state of her hair!'\n\n'You don't actually like him, do you?'\n\nJess got up and left. God, she couldn't stand them sometimes. They're like a group of god damned fucking puppies, she thought to herself. Yapping away about anything and everything, following her around, irritating her all day...\n\nJess stormed over to the table where *he* was sat with his lady friend. She sat down in such a manner that this time her appearance could not go unnoticed.\n\n'Leave,' she hissed at the girl.\n\n'Stay,' came his reply, although he spoke while looking directly at the other girl.\n\nThe poor girl looked frightened. She didn't want to ignore a direct order from the most popular girl in school but she'd also just been told to stay by this mysterious boy with the dark eyes.\n\n'I said leave,' said Jess, her voice barely louder than a whisper but cutting so clearly through the air she may as well have been shouting.\n\n'That's no way to talk to my little sister,' came his swift reply.\n\n'It's fine, I'll see you later,' the younger girl said to him, then she stood up, threw her bag over her shoulder and left.\n\n'Oh, I'm s-' Jess was cut off mid speech.\n\n'You know, if you're trying to make me like you you're doing a very bad job.'\n\n'What makes you think I'm trying to do that?'\n\n'Then why have you come over here again?'\n\n'Because I don't understand why you sent me away last time. There's a difference between me wanting you to like me and me not wanting you to dislike me.'\n\n'There is indeed, but tell me, are you as concerned about me as you are with the other 1,500 students?'\n\n*Bastard*, thought Jess.\n\n'You don't seem like the others.'\n\n'How so?'\n\n'Well you're sitting here reading 19th century Russian literature whilst others are concerned about pop culture and taking selfies, so you'll forgive me for being the slightest bit intrigued.'\n\nFor the first time, he smiled. It wasn't a dry smirk like last time, it was an actual smile. He's enjoying himself! Jess blushed and fidgeted with her hair. \n\nFrom the far corner, Megan and the girls watched intently. They'd never seen Jess this engaged with someone before.\n\n'She's playing with her hair!'\n\n'Do you think she likes him?'\n\n'No, Jess doesn't like boys... she just uses them.'\n\n'Look at her face, she can't keep her eyes off him.'\n\nBack at her table, Jess was still waiting for his response. Once again, he'd paused in thought. She didn't like it when he did this, it felt too much like he was the one in control. But at the same time, she did like it. At least he's actually thinking about what he's going to say, that makes a nice change from the usual idiots I sit with, she thought.\n\n'Well, if you'd like to get to know me, here's not the place-,' just then the bell rang, cutting him off, 'or the time.'\n\nHe stood up to his full and considerable height.\n\n'Catch you next time, Jessica.'\n\nWithin seconds he'd disappeared into the crowd of students heading to their final lesson. The absolute bastard, she thought. \n\nAnd she still didn't know his name.\n\n", "id": "d3pf7ho"}, {"comment": "**Part 3**\n\n**Tuesday**\n\nJess sat nervously in the lunch hall, waiting for him. She had been a complete zombie all day long, only half-listening to the conversations around her. She couldn't stop thinking about *him.*\n\nJess knew this was bad.\n\nYou should never become too dependant on another person, her older sister had told her. Because if they leave, you will be in a whole world of hurt. But she just couldn't help herself; this boy was clever, strong, intriguing and mysterious. A conversation with him was enthralling, she never knew what he was going to say but she did know it would be something of value, something that would challenge her and make her think. As she sat listening to Charlotte droning on in an uninspiring monologue about a dress she'd seen in New Look last Thursday, Jess longed for his company.\n\nAnd then something happened that even Charlotte was unable to talk through. He entered the hall, and instead of sitting in his usual seat he strode right over to Jess's table, the whole time with his eyes fixed solely on hers.\n\n'Would you like to go for a walk?' He asked, his voice sincere.\n\nJess nodded, feeling like she would be unable to find her voice right now. Other boys on surrounding tables looked on with pure disbelief smacked across their faces - who was this kid? He's new here and has just casually walked over to the most popular group of girls in the school and is now walking off with *Jess fucking Brown*. Disbelief soon turned to jealously.\n\n'What's your name?' Jess blurted, as soon as they had turned the corner and headed for the school field. It hadn't been the best way to ask, but this had been bugging her for ages.\n\n'Alec,' he responded with a smile, and his dark eyes seemed to gleam as he looked down at her.\n\nJess blushed.\n\n'So tell me, why aren't you interested in any of the other boys?' he asked 'I saw most of the football A team sat near you, doesn't the best player in their team hold some prestige?'\n\n'Nah,' scoffed Jess, 'he's short.'\n\n'Height is not the measure of a man, Jessica,' Alec frowned.\n\n'Easily said when you're 6'1,' she replied, looking up at him.\n\nAlec stopped in his tracks, and appeared to be quite annoyed.\n\n'I'm serious, you mustn't be so quick to judge others.'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'Its not morally right.'\n\n'Oh, so we're talking morally now?'\n\nOnce again, Jess sensed that Alec was enjoying himself, despite the fact they were having a disagreement. This quick witted back-and-forth conversation seems to be the way to see the true Alec, thought Jess. This was perfectly okay with her, after all, there was no one else around who could keep up a conversation like this.\n\n'Are you familiar with Kant's second form of the Categorical Imperative?' Asked Alec, his eyes now clearly glistening with excitement.\n\n'Yes,' replied Jess, seemingly unperturbed by the fact that the conversation had just switched to 18th Century philosophical theories. 'Kant believed that for an objective moral law to be passed, it must go through two universal criteria; first it must remain within the realms of what is logically possible, and second it must not frustrate the most basic human needs for survival.'\n\nAlec looked happier than a small child at Christmas. Inside, the churning of Jess's stomach was matched only by the rapid beating of her heart.\n\n'Perfect!' he said, 'So now do you see my point?'\n\n'I do,' replied Jess, 'judging and discriminating against people for their height could pass through the first test because there are no logical inconsistencies.'\n\n'But,' continued Alec, 'it could have difficulties passing through the second test because shunning people based on height could have lead to discord amongst the close-knit communities of primitive humans, causing relations to be weaker and therefore threatening survival.'\n\n'And even if you argue that judging people on height does not threaten survival,' said Jess, now in full flow, 'I wouldn't want that law passed anyway.' Her father was a small man and she absolutely adored him.\n\n'You were right,' conceded Jess, 'point well made, I guess I'll be less judgemental from now on.'\n\nAlec beamed at her, 'That would make me very happy.'\n\nShe felt refreshed and enlightened. Philosophy wasn't her favourite talking point but it just felt so good to get away from everyone else for once, to talk about something, anything else. It was a lovely day outside. Alec's hair blew this way and that in the gentle breeze.\n\nThey walked out into the middle of the field and sat down together, enjoying the sun.

Chance was one of the robotics kids at our school. Really, he was just a nobody. Then there\u2019s me, Samantha, queen bee of our high-school, cheerleader elite. I was dating Darren, the Quarterback and All-American.\n\nIt all started on that damn day when Darren and I were walking down the hall with some of his jock buddies. Honestly, I don't know what they were talking about really, but I just smiled and faked laughed as usual. I was looking back and making a comment to one of the boys when suddenly Darren started yelling. \n\n\"Watch where you\u2019re going dumbass.\" Darren snarled. In front of Darren was Chance. It looked like they had just bumped into one another. Chance, had dropped some books and was picking them up. Most guys (especially ones that looked like Chance, dark haired, glasses, and ill advised outfit) would have been quaking at the thought of Darren being angry at them, who is 6\u20194, 200 pounds of pure savory muscle. This time was different, Chance stood up as smoothly as he had bent down to pick up his books, and peered straight into Darren\u2019s eyes. \"Hey man didn't see you there, ill watch out next time.\" He said this just as calmly as he picked up his books while adjusting his brown spectacles. In an instant, I saw Darren make a move towards Chance. Knowing his temperament, I grabbed his arm quickly, \"He\u2019s not worth it baby, lets just go.\" Darren let up a little and looked back at Chance, who was just staring, not even caring he was about to get his ass-kicked. Darren breathed out, \"I\u2019ll catch you later you little shit.\" I gave Chance the I-just-saved-your-ass-nerd look. Then I strutted away with Darren on my arm. \n\nDear Diary, Chance here,\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with my code? I\u2019ve quadruple checked it already. I can\u2019t seem to figure out one of the last algorithms to help make smooth movement on the robot I've been working on. The robot is designed to help plant crops and diagnose levels of nutrients in the ground. Plus it's also meant to help aging farmers move around. I\u2019ve been working on this robot for years actually, I got the idea for it after I helped code a cost effective insulin pump for the poor (the idea came to me because my test subject was a farmer with diabetes). Anyway, my day actually became a lot more interesting because within this train of thought I was having about the algorithm, I ran into a much less metaphorical train.\n\n\"Watch where you\u2019re going dumbass.\" Snarled the high-school Quarterback Darren. A big oaf, whom I am sorry to say doesn't have the same intelligence as his size. As I was picking up my books, I noticed he was with his buddies and his girlfriend Samantha. Who as far as I was concerned, was queen bitch of our school. The truth is, Darren and his group didn't scare me at all. What these guys don't know about me is that I am the state\u2019s Golden Gloves silver-medalist in boxing's light heavy-weight division (courtesy of my mother pushing me, rest her soul). So, even if they were to try and fight me I'm pretty sure I actually had more real fight experience than all of them combined (and IQ too). My mother never wanted me to fight outside the ring, and always wanted me to be a good kid that focused on my studies and the needs of others. So instead, I just told him sorry, to which he retorted something stupider than he looks. His girlfriend pulled him away and gave me a look of contempt. Something which I mirrored back. I had no time for her kind of people. After that, I just continued onto the robotics lab, where I had more pressing issues to delve into.\n\nDear Diary, Samantha here,\n\nI find myself not being able to stop thinking about Chance all weekend. The way he was so calm when dealing with Darren peaked my interest him. So, this week, I found myself looking out the school yard, the halls, and classrooms to get a glance of Chance. Glance of Chance, ha that sounds so poetic. Anyway, this week I saw something that got to me that I made my stomach drop. \n\nI was walking by the robotics lab when I saw him there, sitting at the desk staring into his Macbook Pro. There were some other people around him and a girl that was sitting close, \"damn her\" I thought. Suddenly, I realized I was jealous. Not only was I jealous of another girl, it was over a nerd at our school. How could that be possible? Furthermore, that\u2019s not the thing that got me. Truth is, over the past week I have taken the long route to pass by the robotics lab to catch a glimpse of Chance. I noticed that he works tirelessly in school and after school to work on his projects. I started to become curious as to what he was actually working on. There was a girl sitting by me in one of my classes that works in the robotics club with Chance. I asked her casually what they were working on, not to give myself away. She said that they were working on devices to help improve the lives of people around them. \"What a joke!\" I found myself berating her. \"What makes you think that you can change anything?\" However, as I said this, all I felt was myself being more intrigued by Chance and a little guilt too. I blushed just thinking about him.\n\nFinally, on Friday of this week. I decided that I was gonna muster up the courage to talk to him. In spite of the possible repercussions it might have. Who knows? Maybe ill just ask him some stupid physics question to make it seem more natural? So finally, after third period I went walked towards the robotics center wondering what I would say to him. Right before I got into the door hit someone, Whack, I looked up and I saw bright brown glasses, and all I could muster was \n\n\"Hey.\" \n\nDear Diary, Chance here,\n\nI worked my butt off this week and have found myself really close to cracking the code. However, thats not really what I want to write about. This week I noticed something kind of strange. Every time that I am in the robotics lab I have started to see Samantha walk by the robotics window and peer in for a second, then she just shuffles away. I really don't understand it and wish she would just stop. I'm pretty sure she's just coming by to make fun of me or some of the people in robotics. It\u2019s getting pretty annoying. So I decided that the next time she would come by I would give her a piece of my mind. This Friday I would do it. \n\nSo when the time came after third period, (which is usually when she comes through) I saw her slowly walking by. This time she wasn't looking through the window but it seemed like she was muttering something to herself. No matter. I got up and walked to the door and opened it. Whack. She was much closer than I realized and as I opened the door I just ran myself into her by accident. She looked up at me with her big (now that I'm up closer) extremely beautiful blue eyes. I lost train of thought and just blurted out\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nNote: I noticed this story is getting long, please let me know if you guys like it so far!", "id": "d3ojsru"}, {"comment": "I feel like this is just a build up to a punchline where where she \"lost her Chance\".\n\nEither way, continue please.

I'll change names and make it dialoguey.\n\n--\n\nCassie sighed a deep sigh as she walked into Theatre II, first period. She looked over at CJ casually playing on his years-old 3DS. The sounds indicated he was playing at iteration of smash. \n\nShe sat two seats away from him as always, with Cade and Katherine between them. As Mrs. Garcia began calling roll, she silently waited for her name.\n\n\"Elizabeth Allison?\" \"Here.\"\n\n\"Cassie Britfield?\"\n\nCJ looked so cute in his TMNT jacket.\n\n\"CASSIE!\" \n\n\"HERE!\" she cried, startled.\n\nAs soon as roll finished, people automatically rose to go attend to final details. That afternoon, the class was headed to an elementary school to perform a children's play - a sort of CD, hopefully maturing into one or two theatre department members in four to nine years. Cassie was playing a bratty princess, and CJ a kind grandfather.\n\nMiraculously, she and CJ were both on set crew. She used this time to attempt to flirt; saying hi, asking about his interests, flipping her hair, the works. She knew she was gorgeous, but not in a self-centered way; she knew she had a good body and long, soft black hair. She just wished it mattered to CJ. NOTHING seemed to matter to him; did he even have a sex drive? \n\nThoughts of that had to be pushed out of her mind for now, there were set pieces to load up. After an hour of work, they were ready. A short drive to the elementary school later, they were setting up.\n\nDuring which, of course, CJ went back to playing on his DS. He was too adorable to disturb, so she went about the set setup herself. Following setup, the little kids filed into the cafetorium in neat lines under the tyrannical watch of early education majors. \n\nCJ was amazing in his performance, as always. Hidden beneath the hoodie and long, unkempt hair was a veritable acting genius. He made the kids laugh when he wanted them to laugh and they calmed when he wanted them quiet. As he came backstage once his parts were over, she congratulated him.\n\n\"Thanks, Cassie! You were great too!\" He replied, ever kind. He knew she liked him and so tried to be nice in the stead of romantic interest. It just hurt more. Two years of patient kindness, not one loving word or look in return. \n\nAfter the show ended and four hundred children were high-fived, striking the set was the next step. CJ thankfully worked diligently at this as opposed to setup and the work was going quickly until they crashed into each other on the tiny stage. Cassie fell backwards while CJ hit a wall and slid down it. Ever the closet gentleman, CJ scurried over to Cassie to make sure she was okay.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" He asked, worry on his face. \n\nCassie found it amusing that he still worried when it was a simple tumble. He had never been this close to her; he was directly above her, by maybe a foot. An irrational thought took her mind and she let it act out - she reached up, put her hand on the back of his neck, sat up on one elbow, and kissed him.\n\nThe rest of the day registers as a blur in Cassie's memory. She knows CJ screamed in surprised disgust and toppled backwards, hitting his head on a metal cart (causing yet another yell). People came to the scene and laughed. She sat in silence during the drive back and the drive home. It all merged together in a whir of laughter, yells, and green hoodies.\n\nAnd once she was home, she cried. \n\n---\n\nPlease note that this story is a somewhat dramatized account of an actual event. Names are changed as are certain chronological elements. \n\nFor those who may want to know what happened afterwards, CJ changed to a policy of avoidance of Cassie, which did nothing to affect her feelings. It's now about a calendar year later and she still likes him, and he still will have nothing to do with her. ", "id": "d3ogcwx"}, {"comment": "Damn.

Satisfied, she turned back to her Biology quiz and absently filled in the multiple choices. It didn't bother her that she would likely fail the test. Nothing bothered her anymore, except for the idea that she might lose Andy. This was the thought that kept her mind in a perpetual whirlwind of doubt and her body in a constant flurry of anxiety. She looked up again. Still there. Good.\n\nThe bell rung and Jessica forced herself to remain seated. It wouldn't do to be noticed, and in any case, Andy was still frantically scribbling. She bit into her lower lip, holding fast with anticipation until most of the class turned in their papers. As Andy began doing the same, Jessica stood up, forcing her tensely wooden body into a casual saunter. She tasted blood from her gnawed lip and quickly licked away. *Nothing out of the ordinary,* she thought.\n\nJessica maintained a safe distance from Andy, keeping her eyes downcast and relying on the self-graffiti'd skull and crossbones that adorned the sides of his black and white Chuck Taylors. Her chest swelled with a torrent of fire as she swallowed the urge to gaze up, to glance at his greasy, unkempt mane and slender, undefined physique. *I will have him soon enough*, she reminded herself.\n\nAndy reached the end of the hallway and paused at the heavy glass doors that led out of the building. Jessica drew a sharp breath and felt a momentary panic as he rested a hand on the handle, before turning to his right and entering the adjacent Men's Room. Jessica sighed, uttering a silent gratitude to whichever cruelly benevolent god had allowed this dance to go forward. Without so much as checking her surroundings, she followed him in.\n\nTwo boys were standing at the long row of urinals. One jumped back, furiously fumbling at his zipper, while the other several rows away just stared with an expression of confusion. \"Girl, this is the Men's Room, what the hell...\" Jessica fixed a withering gaze on both. \"Out,\" she snarled. Both shuffled quickly away, sliding with deliberate distance around Jessica and casting wary, sidelong glances at her as they left. She locked the door. It didn't matter who saw her, anymore.\n\nJessica began to walk past the row of stalls across from the urinals. Empty. Empty. Empty. She reached the last one at the end, next to the frosted glass window that led outside. She glanced down and breathed a deep, exhilarating sigh of relief. Skull and bones on black and white. The heady smell of cheap weed emanated from inside. Suddenly, a wave of panic rushed over her. *I haven't planned for this moment,* she realized. With the crushing fear that she would lose her nerve or run out of time, Jessica knocked impulsively on the stall door.\n\n\"Uh, it's occupied, asshole,\" came the annoyed response. She knocked again. Harder. \"What the fuck? Go away, man.\" Once more. She heard a shuffling of paper and plastic, followed by the toilet flushing and a quick succession of misty sprays. The door swung open with a snap, forcing Jessica to jump back. \"This is a violation of my human...\"\n\nShe stared at him for an eternal few seconds. His puffy, acne scarred face fell into a lithely bony frame, wrapped in an amalgam of black cloth, leather, and chains. For his part, Andy stared back, his features a wash of befuddlement and disbelief. *The calm before the storm,* thought Jessica, eager with anticipation. \"Who the hell...\" Andy began, and then his eyes went wide.\n\nJessica smiled, a huge grin that felt like it was going to fly off the sides of her face. \"You remember,\" she crooned. \"I...no, it was a mistake. Shit. I was stupid. I never meant for anything to happen.\" Jessica's face dropped into a scowl; an instantaneous transition that sent Andy several paces back into the stall.

It was absurd! \n\nWhat had begun almost a year prior as a dare by one of her friends to ask a nerd out in public had boiled into a full-blown obsession for her. The first time she asked him out it was in the school cafeteria, like any other boy in the school would she assumed he would burst out with a million cries of \"yes!\" Instead he merely scoffed and answered with a gruff \"fuck off\" he didn't even miss a beat, rejected her outright in a moment, all her insecurities she hid behind makeup, a nice car and a dozen boyfriends was shattered like thin glass in an instant. \n\nHer obsession began early, the week after his rejection she found his email address and from there was able to find his username on most major websites. She found his Skype username and under the name \"Becca\" had begun chatting to him, to find out what made him tick. \n\nWhat she learned was, behind his class daydreaming, his silent hours in the library reading comics and playing videogames, was someone with an intelligence and self awareness she never thought possible. Her friends who spent every weekend drunk, high and getting fucked seemed more fake by the day, she had grown so completely dissilusioned with them as the months dragged on. Before she had 4 \"main\" boyfriends she would be with, all the popular girls did it, and those popular guys, star athletes all did the same with a few girls. Soon each of them began simply dumping her, Kyle dropped her after she chose to watch \"under the red hood\" at home instead of going to Stevie's party, Saun grew cold after she spent her 300 dollars in birthday money on comics instead of sexy clothes and \"party supplies\" Darren stopped returning her calls, because she stopped calling him. She looked back at her life to see how empty it was. She had begun to focus more and more on her studies while her friends continued to party, and yet at school she maintained her air of popularity, shunning the nerds and hanging out only with the \"beautiful people\" yet her nights were consumed with her chatting to him online, she maintained her persona, she liked being Becca more than Alexis, Becca was so pure, accepting of her insecurities, a girl with dreams and ambition, a girl who had passion in her life, a passion for videogames, comics and batman cartoons, but she actually HAD a passion!\n\nAs the months went on, more and more people could see Alexis had fallen out with the \"beautiful people\" she had stopped wearing miniskirts and stopped going to the stylist, her friends dressed to the best all the time, yet Alexis had begun coming to school in t-shirts and jeans, her long dyed blonde hair had faded and had begun to return to its natural black... She had changed, changed so much, and it was thanks to him, who she talked to every day under a false name, who had enlightened her to the idea of self-awareness, who had awakened her to the joys of having even a simple passion in life which bought more rewarding feelings than a million parties or a billion boyfriends. \n\nThe day had finally come, she woke up at 4am to get herself looking as good as possible, her black hair was curled to bounce when she walked, all her imperfections were covered with makeup and she dressed in tight fitting woolen clothes, completely covering herself yet showing off her ideal figure, the day had come. \n\nShe found him outside the library \"hey, Michael, could I talk with you a moment?\" She asked, her heart racing and her legs almost shaking \"ugh, oh... Kay?\" Answered Michael nearvously, believing this to be a prank, yet he was curious, he wanted to see how they planned to \"get him\" \n\nHe followed her behind the Drama building, he crossed his arms \"okay Alexis, what is it?\" She took a deep breath, collecting herself \"Michael... I've been hoping to say this for awhile now, and... Please, just hear me out... I like you, I have for a long time, the parties and stuff are all so hollow, you have a passion, you think about your future... And I wanna be a part of that.. So what I'm saying is... Could we... Go out?... Together?\" \n\nMichael raised an eyebrow, putting his hands on his hips \"well see Alexis... Its just that... I've already kinda got feelings for someone else, and...\" Here it comes \"... And you're really not my type\" \n\nAs Alexis drove home from school she was FUMING! she bashed in her bedroom door, pulled her jewellery off and stormed into the bathroom to wipe the streaming makeup off her face... Her phone vibrated, a Skype message, from Michael to Becca... She opened it, and it read \"Hey Bec, listen I know this is out of the blue but something happened today that's kinda pushed me over the edge and I have to tell you... I've been having feelings for you awhile now-\" she closed the phone and say it down carefully... It made sense now, he only knew her, the REAL her, as Becca, not Alexis, she wiped away her tears and looked her reflection in the eyes. She had to win him, win him from herself, she looked down and closed her eyes \"alright...

He flew through  the classroom leaping past desks and his classmates alike. He stopped at Billy's desk and karate chopped the papers and books onto the floor. Jonathan squealed in glee as he fled the scene at breakneck speed. \n\nIt was recess and only Billy remained at his desk going over See Jack Run over and over. For such a classical piece of literature Billy thought it was remarkably difficult to understand.  Billy took his time though, he was going to be smart, he was going to graduate and finally make the millions he had dreamt about his whole life. Billy knew he could achieve anything he set his mind to, so he set his sights on the books before him.\n\nJulie watched from across the room, surrounded by her usual gaggle of giggling girls and the occasional boy who managed to muster enough courage to try and actually talk to her.  She was queen bee, and the swarm of boys that buzzed around the room amused her. Julie knew that with a word, any of these boys would quit showing off and do whatever she asked. All of them except Billy.  She looked at Jonathan as he ran up to her to collect his reward; a small hug, and a smile that was thought to be a major factor of global warming by those blessed enough to receive one.  Jonathan tried to talk to her, but he was quickly dismissed by Julie's annoyed look. The girls closed ranks around Julie, scavenging Jonathans momentary attentiveness to boost their own standings.  The vultures, thought Julie, but only for a moment as she looked back at Billy struggling his way through Math now.  Julie mumbled to softly to herself, thinking of new schemes to once and for all have every person in the class recognize her greatness.  A small thought emerged in her pretty little head, if she could just have Billy, she would need anyone else.\n\nBilly sat in his usual chair at the front of the class, he had transferred a week ago, and was still completely oblivious to the social interactions of his classmates. That suited him well though, all Billy needed was his studies. If only that girl Julie would stop trying to get my attention, Billy thought. Once again another boy flew past knocking Billy's school supplies onto the floor.  Billy shook his head, he knew he was a bit bigger than the other kids, but Billy knew violence would only get him in trouble. He lowered his head back into the crevasse of his math book and tried to figure out why some numbers were so darn smug. Darn prime numbers, think their better than everyone else, Billy thought.\n\nShe had done all the classic moves; laughed at all his jokes, picked him for her group projects; she had even gone so far as to pinch AND punch him, in one day nonetheless. What else would it take to get Billy to notice her, Julie contemplated.  Finally she had had it, a week had passed and graduation was approaching quickly for Billy, she had to act fast.  With the help of her friends and lackeys, no one knew which they were, Julie created her grandest scheme yet.  She would make him love her even if she had to do so by force.  On the day of Billy's graduation Julie put on her cutest outfit and ran to class, she was determined to kiss him before he left. Everyone in the class knew her plan except the teacher and of course Billy himself. \n\nBilly knew something was wrong as he entered the classroom for his last time, he was finally moving on to the next grade.  As he walked through the door Julie leapt from the side and grasped his neck firmly in her arms as she went for her big moment, but Billy brought one hand around and stopped her lips cold with his oddly large palm. \n\nJulie was stunned, \"WHY\" she screamed. \"Why don't you like me\", she hadn't meant to be so loud, but the rejection shook her to the core.\n\nBilly stumbled back shocked, \"WHY\", he said incredulously. \"I'm 27 years old, that is WHY\" Billy whined.\n\nI haven't seen Billy in some time, but as his former teacher I do keep track of my students.  I hear Billy is doing quite well, something about a hotel chain. Very impressive stuff.  Julie never recovered from the incident.  I hear she became some kind of public relations director at a golf course, but the man she is with is just horrible, some ass named Shooter McGavin. I do hope she find someone better someday. Oh well, till next time, on stories from behind the teachers desk.\n", "id": "d3oct28"}, {"comment": "Nice.

It all feels a little like a John Hughes movie at the end of the day, doesn\u2019t it? The beautiful peoples club doesn\u2019t mix with the punks, who in turn don\u2019t even look at the nerds, who can\u2019t stand the metalheads, despite a shared interest in Iron Maiden. The BPC sometimes hangs with the smart kids, but the latter is generally too up its own ass for the former and they don\u2019t any deep friendships. \n\nSee? There are rules: you just don\u2019t mix with groups too far outside the personality of your own. A jock dating a metalhead? Never going to happen. A member of the BPC and a smart kid, maybe: at least they\u2019re both from rich families. So, what about a member of the BPC and a nerd? \n\nFor Emma, it started in that computer programming class. Her father, out of some overprotective push for her to \u201cbe ready for life,\u201d made her take it; otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be caught dead there. At first, she hated it like she hated everything else about her school day. Day after day, she sat there, unengaged, wanting to slam her laptop on the floor and storm out. \n\nThe first time she ever knowingly appreciated the beauty of any schoolwork was during the first group project, when she was paired with a boy named Thomas. He was obviously taken with programming; he knew the subject matter even before the teacher explained it and was only in the class for easy credit. His expertise and raw confidence helped her see the fun in the simple calendar app they designed together. He was funny to be around and inspiring to learn from. After that she was hooked on the class. \n\nThomas and Emma didn\u2019t speak much after the project. She kept thinking about him, though. It took some time, but she finally realized that she was not just happy about the \u201cA\u201d he helped her get on the project. She realized that she wanted Thomas. \n\nHe was different than the boys she was used to hanging out with. The preening jocks and the cocky sons of lawyers were all, underneath their muscles and expensive clothes, insecure little boys. Thomas, on the other hand, possessed more manly confidence. When he looked at her, his gaze was unwavering, the cadence of his voice calm. Not a single boy in the BPC acted this way. \n\nThomas was a completely new experience for Emma. After processing her feelings, she could not look at the males in the BPC the same way anymore. She realized that her feelings for those boys were out of social obligation, not actual attraction. She fell for Thomas, and resolved to make him hers. He was a nerd, so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard, right?\n\nThe first time Emma texted Thomas, instead of attraction, he felt mild annoyance.\n\n\u201cHey! I have a question about coding class\u2026 do you mind meeting me to help?\u201d\n\nHe was in the middle of focused coding for a website he was building, and his close friends knew not to bother him right now. So when he did answer, several hours later, it was curt.  \n\n\u201cOk.\u201d\n\nThey ended up meeting at a coffee shop, where the fa\u00e7ade quickly fell away. Thomas quickly answered Emma\u2019s one or two basic questions about coding. The rest of the time was filled by Emma\u2019s strained flirting and Thomas\u2019 polite, but uninterested, replies. They left after only thirty minutes, both feeling awkward about the meeting. \n\nWhen Thomas returned home, he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around what just happened. He recognized Emma\u2019s behavior as flirting, but could not divine her motives. Emma was classically, painfully beautiful. This rendered her constantly surrounded by boys of the BPC, all vying for her attention. \u201cShe must want another \u2018A\u2019 on the next group project,\u201d he thought. \u201cMary\u2019s gonna love this!\u201d\n\nThomas, being an avid programmer, put little personal information on the internet. This included his relationship status, which was \u201cspoken for.\u201d When Thomas told Mary of Emma\u2019s manufactured tutoring session, Mary agreed that Emma was flirting. Mary suggested, however, that Emma\u2019s motives might be romantic instead of scholastic. At the mere suggestion, Thomas ridiculed Emma- her seemingly vacuous personality, her social climbing, and her trying to be someone she wasn\u2019t. Thomas kept going, oblivious to his cruelty toward another human. Mary quickly made Thomas stop; beating a dead horse was not Mary\u2019s style. \n\nThomas\u2019 relationship status was quite a shock for Emma the next day when she saw Mary and Thomas together in the parking lot after school. Emma had finally worked up the courage to talk to Thomas. She wanted to chat with him, to just enjoy his company. She rushed away at the sight of Thomas and Mary holding hands. Thomas never spotted her, thank goodness. He was still feeling superior and might have relayed as much to Emma. \n\nEmma and Thomas did not work together on the next group project in coding class, nor did they speak to one another for the rest of high school. They drifted separately through their senior year unaware that life gives us plenty of chances for reinvention. Emma was already in the process of hers; she knew she wanted to study programming in college, and was feeling strangely pleased by the arched eyebrows her interest in programming spurred among the members of the BPC. Eventually they both became complex adults- both interesting mixes of stereotypically opposing interests, both just following their hearts. \n\n", "id": "d3ogqoo"}], [{"comment": "\"Emily, Look.

Tearing up, trembling, and choking. Yet no matter how she looks, I always find it hard to breathe around her. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s sucking the life out of me. Yet it was the reason I live. It\u2019s the reason why I continued going to school despite the ridicule, the rumours, and the bullying. The reason why I did my best in my academics, the only thing I\u2019ve got going for me. The reason why I turned my back on my precious hobbies, which are kept and sealed away. All of that, just to repair the relationship that was destroyed. Just so I could reach the upper echelons of the school society so that we could be equals. Just so I could be worthy.\n\nYet my only reward was silence. Utter silence.\n\nI peered into the bag. Sure enough, it has books, DVDs and lots of them. But it is not the full collection. It\u2019s not everything. You can\u2019t have everything in this world. And sometimes, although you can have everything else, you are likely to lack that one or two things, which even if you attempt to trade your entire world for that one thing, you are still not allowed to have it. I deeply understand that fact. \n\nMy eyes are fixed on a frail-looking girl. The same girl who walked away when I needed her the most.

My blood was boiling, and my mind was a playlist on an infinite anger loop. I walked for about an hour like this without really thinking about where I was going. Then I found myself in a clearing in the woods and there was this deer \u2013 a doe, a beautiful female deer\u2014just standing there. It was early spring and suddenly I noticed that there were buds on the trees and the leaves were vibrantly green\u2014the kind of green that happens after a heavy rain. I inhaled the earthy scent of rotting leaves and fresh onion grass.* \n\n\n*That unblinking doe made eye contact with me. She picked her hoof up and pawed at the ground.

For starters, he\u2019s an underclassman, and I\u2019m usually into older guys with 5 o\u2019clock shadows and deep, low voices. He\u2019s average height, pale, and lanky with dark hair and green eyes. He has the kind of long eyelashes that women work hard to emulate using mascara, and men have no right to possess naturally. And ever since we paired up in class, I was absolutely obsessed. \n\n\nI have never tried so hard to impress a man in my life. I worked hard on my physical appearance, straightening my hair, strategically reapplying make up before our class together, and trying to figure out which outfits would be a turn on without being slutty.

I could make a shallow physical impression on any man, but I wanted to *woo* Tobias. \n\n\nOur texting began innocently enough. We chatted about schoolwork. One time I asked him when an assignment was due. He was absent one day from class and he asked what he had missed while he was out. It was all business, for a time. \n\n\nIt should be noted that we very rarely spoke in person. We were cordial, but there was not a lot of overlap in our friend groups. Not to mention the fact that ever since the initial \u201cbirdbrain\u201d incident, I didn\u2019t trust my tongue around him. \n\n\nWinter was beginning to fade into spring.

He didn't have anyone else to talk to about these things, and suddenly the prettiest, most popular girl in school was following him to tournaments, cheering him on, and making him the envy of every one of his opponents?\n\nSurely it was too good to be true!\n\n\"So that's a dragon, right? That means it breathes fire and stuff, yeah?\"\n\nJames fought back a groan and lowered his head into his arms as the girl behind him made her way around the table. He made it look like he was tired or something, making sure to make some kind of affirmative noise as to not be rude.\n\nThe monster depicted on the card was swimming in the ocean with its multitude of tentacles. There was a bright blue bubble on the corner with the word WATER printed in all capital letters.\n\nShe was trying, but she wasn't really.\n\nJames raised his head and gave an exasperated look to the girl across the cafeteria table as she settle down.\n\nHe was a loser and he knew it, but that didn't mean he wasn't entitled to have pride, did it?\n\nEither directly or indirectly, how often had he or his passions found themselves insulted by this girl? How often had he been made out to be a fool through her attempts to do whatever it was she intended with him?\n\nHe had the tact not to have the stereotypical response and tell her off about these things - he was just a teenage boy, after all! - but after *months*...?\n\nWas the attention that wasn't really attention worth it?\n\nWhat did she even want from him?\n\nWas it a dare from a friend? Did she just think he was cute? Did she intend to \"cure\" him of the hobby once they were dating? Was this some new form of bullying, maybe?\n\nBetween her attitude thus far and the shame society had conditioned him to feel about his interests, unable to just enjoy himself in peace, he couldn't imagine her simply liking him for him, but just *not caring about the game*. It was beyond his comprehension, a possibility that would never cross his mind. \n\nAll that crossed his mind, all that ever would cross his mind, was the way she so fervently pursued him but couldn't be bothered to do much as look at a picture she was trying to start a conversation over.\n\nHe wasn't an idiot, even if he didn't know he might have been.\n\n\"I liked unicorns when I was a kid.\" She offered randomly.\n\nJames took a deep breath as she finished her thought.\n\nIt wasn't that he was offended by unicorns.\n\nIt wasn't even that he couldn't see that she *was* trying.\n\nBut enough was enough. Surely a guy like him wasn't worth it to *her* pride at this point!\n\nHe was going to do it. He had to.\n\nRight now. He had to do it right now, or he never would.\n\n\"C-Can we talk?\"\n\n***\n\nAnd there. He'd done it.\n\nJudging by her expression, not to mention the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, something told him he had been making a lot of assumptions.\n\nShe stood to go, but stopped. He realized too late there was nowhere else to sit and she had barely touched her food.\n\n\"Hey, you don't have to... The cafeteria is crowded and I don't... mind...\" The words felt dirty on his mouth after what he'd done, but lying about his feelings, especially now, would be a greater insult to both of them.\n\nShe inhaled sharply as she lowered a herself back into her seat. Her gaze was kept downwards.\n\n\"It's okay. Just, like...\"\n\nJames wasn't sure if she was struggling to find the words or if she as struggling not to cry. It made his stomach churn.\n\n\"Just let me stay one last time, 'kay?\"\n\nIt was horribly awkward. Neither of them spoke after, but he didn't have the heart to reject her request.\n\nSure enough, five minutes to the bell ringing, she got up and left without a word. It was clear that this... whatever it had been between them, it was long over now.\n\nJames had gotten what he wanted at long last, but somehow, he felt positively miserable watching her go.\n\nHe'd made the right call... hadn't he?\n\n***\n\nI'm a little rusty, had to fade out on arguably the most important part.

He wanted to reach across and pop that bubble and slather it all over that gorgeous hair she was so proud of.\nHis head was throbbing and burned from the resentment that boiled and erupted from within him.\nIt was perfect really, the justice in it all.

She had finally given up and once again went back to his nothing thoughts and his nothing paper, until from the corner of his eye, he saw her bluish eye peeking at his work, or should he say, lack of work. \nThe smell of her light floral perfume lingered in the air around him and mingled with the peach smelling shampoo that leapt off her hair. He tried not to get distracted.\nShe was leaning over his notebook, head bent and both of her elbows cupping her cheeks as she stared intently.\n\u201cYou know\u2026,\u201dshe looked up from his notebook, \u201cI could help you with this if you\u2019re not getting anywhere.

In the class commotion, Alex managed to weave his way through the milling students with his book in hand and avoided any further words. \nHe was almost home free when he felt her hand tap his shoulder. He knew it was her because of the peach. She spun him towards her. \n\u201cHey, what did you mean back there when you said you shouldn\u2019t be talking to me? You keep giving me the meanest stares.

Donald Trump, the greatest president in the history of the United States, got into power by channeling the spirit of the evil Native American Head Looks Like Maize.

This allowed Head Looks Like Maize to control Trump's body. The plan paid off but unfortunately Trump was in the power of Head Looks Like Maize.\n\nYou see, the spirit of Head Looks Like Maize has to rest every 12 hours for 12 hours and that's when Trump could do what he wanted like fulfill his own goals like appear on Saturday Night Live.

His sigh turned into a shriek, however, when a heavy object landed on top of his locker with a loud BANG! He bit his tongue, hoping beyond hope that whatever it was would simply leave without finding him as thick talons scraped upon the metal with a grating screech. \n\n\n\nSuddenly, a brilliant white light erupted from the direction of the doorway. Diggs was blinded, even from inside the locker, and he quickly shielded his eyes with his forearm. Above him, the creature was not so lucky. It let out a hissing roar, talons biting into the thin metal as it leapt away into the air in an effort to get away from the source of the blinding light. There was a muffled cracking sound, as if someone had broken a piece of cardboard, and the thing's strange high-pitched ululations gradually grew softer and softer as it fled. \n\n\nAs swiftly as it had come, the light vanished into nothing. \"Are you alright?\" Said a voice from just outside of Digg's hiding spot. \"That *Alran* nearly got you.\" \n\n\nThe door gently swung open, leaving Diggs blinking. In front of him stood a young man, in his early twenties, with a shock of black hair that made his head look as if it were several times larger than it was. He wore a brown robe, like the other men had before, but it looked to be one or two sizes too large for him. The excess material \n\n\nThe newcomer offered a hand to Diggs, smiling meekly. \"Need a hand there? You can call me Raven.\" \n\n\nDiggs took the offered limb gratefully, grunting to his feet. \"Raven? 'sn't that a girls name?\" \n\n\n\n\nRaven chuckled lightly. \"Well, if I am being honest, it isn't my real name. More of a title, really. We aren't supposed to use our real names on the surface.\" \n\n\n\n\"Th' surface?\" Diggs blinked incredulously. \"'s that suppos' to mean?\" \n\n\n\n\"Don't worry too much about it. You won't remember any of this anyway.\" \n\n\nDiggs began to protest, but Raven cut him off with a wave of his hand. \"Later. For now we need to get your somewhere safe. The men who were here before have locked down the borders of this building with a barrier, so I can't just let you out. Any hole I made would let those lizards out too, after all...I made enough of a mess of it getting through myself. Taking you out would probably compromise it altogether...hmm...\" \n\n\n\nDiggs began to back toward the door, sneaking away while Raven was lost in thought. *I have had ENOUGH of these loonies. Lizard men, freaks in robes...if this day goes any worse, I'll wind up dead!* \n\n\n\n\n\"Aha!\" Exclaimed Raven, making the miner flinch and jerk his hand away from the door handle he had just reached out to touch. \"I have just the trick. Any chance I could convince you to get back in that locker?\" \n\n\n\n\nA few moments later, and Diggs was out cold, with his face stuffed uncomfortably close to a dirty mop. \n\n\n\n\"It's for your own good, you know.\" Said Raven charitably, grunting slightly as he tried to close the locker door over Digg's shoe. \"They will NEVER find you in here...when I am done with you...whew!\" He sighed as the door finally shut with a metallic *clink*. \n\n\n\n\"Now, to make sure you don't get out...\" Raven closed his eyes in concentration, putting his palm on the locker door. A flash of purplish-white light rippled over the locker at his touch, cascading from edge to edge like a visible echo. \n\n\n\"Barrier...in place...there we go! Now, off to the portal. Can't let Falcon and the birdbrains just take anything they want, now, can we?\" \n\n\n\nAnd with that, he leisurely walked down the hall whistling a merry tune, leaving the unconscious miner to his dreams of lizards and strange lights.

We all pooled our strength to make that barrier, there is no way anyone could have broken it so easily!\" He barely looked back at the others as he kept on walking. \"One of that strength should take hours to crack!\" \n\n\n\"See for yourself then.\" Falcon stated. Harpy grunted and crossed his arms, glaring at the time mage with a smirk on his face. \n\n\n\n\nOwl went rigid for a moment, closing his eyes in concentration. \"...He's right!\" \n\n\n\n\n\"Of course he is. Lord Falcon is always right.\" Harpy snorted at Owl, a look of open disdain plain upon his face. \"If you worked with him as long as I had, you would know that.\" \n\n\n\nSparrow rushed towards the three men from farther along the corridor, eyes wide with panic.\n\n\n\n\"Someone got through the barrier!\" He panted, clearly out of breath. \n\n\n\n\"We know already Sparrow, thank you.\" Owl smiled. He almost pitied the boy. \n\n\n\n\n\"But what could have broken it so easily? It's not like they are fragile.\" Sparrow looked like he was working himself into a tizzy. His breathing came in labored bursts, emotion compounded by his exertion of running back to his companions. \n\n\n\nFalcon raised his hand, gesturing as if he was considering patting the young mage on the head. \"Peace, Sparrow. It is not WHAT, but rather WHO. They have sent a Raven after us.\" \n\n\n\n\nOwl looked far from comforted. \"A Raven!?\" He swore. \"What makes you so sure?\" \n\n\n\n\"Only a Raven class mage could break a barrier like that so easily. He must specialize in brute force infiltration.\" Falcon explained. \"We should keep moving. Judging by the last gateway, we have at least one more ahead of us before we catch up to our target. We want to be long gone before that Raven gets here. God knows what is following him.\" \n\n\n\n\"There is a what looks to be a sort of colosseum up ahead.\" Said Sparrow, trying to regain some of his composure. \"It has stands, sort of, and a big gate in the center. I can't see a way through, but a bit of mana keeps leaking through the door. I am pretty sure that the next portal is on the other side.\" He looked up at Falcon questioningly.\n\n\n\n\"Everything is made of the same metal as these walls...what is this place?\" \n\n\n\nFalcon smiled his strange smile, what little warmth it held not quite reaching his eyes. \"We are in the Hall of the Bloody Dead. It is a testament to the foolishness of mankind, I am afraid. After those terrible events in the Ruins, the old god *Alranil* was set loose. A mortal god, power incarnate, was free to do as it wished in the world of men!\" For a moment, hunger flashed across Falcon's eyes, before it vanished as if it had never been there at all. \"Countless perished, even those that had no connection at all to the ones who raised her from whatever realm she first called home. This hall was Mankind's first attempt at sealing her.\" \n\n\nHe paused for a moment, a look of worry and sadness on his face. \"It was our greed that caused our undoing, in the end. The men who built this place wanted more than to seal *Alranil*, you see. Even under the tightest of seals, the amount of mana a god like that produces is astronomical! And so they created this place, with walls of *mithril* to channel that power that they might use it for their own purposes.\"\n\n\n\nHe tapped the wall, which let out a clear peal like a bell being struck. \"Sadly, they were blinded by their greed. *Alranil* produced far more magical power than they anticipated. Even asleep, she shook the very foundations of their seal to the breaking point, warping reality around her to the breaking point. And when she awoke...she had no mercy for those who wished to enslave her.\" \n\n\n\n\nThe walls began to taper outward, and soon gave way to a vast circular room made of the same faintly glowing *mithril* as before, bathing the chamber in pale light. Rows upon rows of seats, like metal steps, stretched to the slightly domed ceiling far above. Against the far wall, a large ornately carved gate depicting a stylized lizard with six limbs cut an arch into the high wall that surrounded the circular floor on which they stood. A faint whispering echoed off of the walls, as if the stands were full of people hiding just out of sight. \n\n\n\n\n\"Those who made these halls were not given an easy death. Like the *Alran* from before, they still frequent in these halls. Unlike those poor savages, however, *Alranil* was not so kind as to leave them their bodies...or their minds.\" Falcon stopped, turning to the other three. \"There is only one way through this gate, and that is by impressing those who still haunt this place even now. And there is only one way to impress them, I am afraid. Two of us must fight...to the death.\" \n\n\n", "id": "d2ixwm9"}, {"comment": "Raven strolled his way through the mine, practically dancing across the dust and uneven stone as if it were red carpet.

I knew you were here ages ago, after all.\" \n\n\n\nSilently, shadows all around the room detached themselves from the encompassing darkness. Scales slid over stone with a soft rustling as dozens and dozens of *Alran* crept from their hiding places. \n\n\n\n\n*\"How did you know?\"* One hissed, speaking without moving its mouth. It crept closer to him, rearing onto its hind four legs so that it was far taller than Raven. \"*We were totally silent!*\" It snapped it's jaws in frustration at the end of the last word, fixing the young mage with a lambent purple eye. \n\n\n\n\"You were very quiet, true.\" Raven still spoke quite calmly. \"It was your minds that gave you away. All breaking bones and snapping jaws...really you made quite a racket.\" \n\n\n\n\nThe creature blinked, lower eyelid rising to cover its pupil. \n\n\n\n\"Listen. I know you may not like me, or my kind. But I am going to ask you *nicely* to make your way back into your temple and leave this realm alone. It is not your place here.\" \n\n\n\nThe lizard chuckled, the sound rasping in a throat that was clearly never intended to laugh. *\"We have decided we like it here. Yesss...many tasty men here. More will come if we stay.\"* \n\n\n\n\nRaven frowned, eyes falling into shadow. \"No more will come. The building is locked down, you must have noticed this by now. If you meet anyone else, it will be more like me. And when they come - and they will - they will slaughter you all.\" \n\n\n\n\nThe *Alran* slapped its tail on the stone in anger at this, eyes rolling madly. *\"Like your companion slaughtered us before? And yet* you *dare to call* us *monsters?*\" It bared its fangs, companions creeping ever closer on all sides. *\"Why should we listen to YOU\"*\n\n\n\n\n\"Because if I so chose it YOU WOULD ALL BE DEAD RIGHT NOW!\" Raven opened his eyes, entire body flaring purple for a moment in his anger. The *Alran* who had been circling him hastily stepped back behind their rocks. \n\n\n\n\n\nRaven sighed, letting the purple glow fade. \"Please. There has been enough bloodshed tonight, on both sides. Go home. And until the portals fade, stay as far away from them as you can.\" \n\n\n\nThe *Alran* who had been speaking inclined his head in defeat. *\"Very well.\"* It said. *\"We will listen to your request. In exchange, we ask that you remove your friends from our halls and assure us that none will trespass on our land again.\"*\n\n\n\n\nRaven smiled. \"Exactly what I intend to do.\" \n\n\n\nThe *Alran* parted before him as he continued walking through the mine.

To\u2026to the death?\u201d Owl stuttered as the color visibly drained out of his round face. \u201cSurely you must be joking!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo joke, my friend.\u201d Falcon shook his head grimly. \u201cIt is the only thing that will get them to even consider opening these doors. We are in their territory now, and we have to play by their rules.\u201d \n\nOwl nearly fell backwards. \u201cListen, uhhh, you still need me! If I go, those portals will close, remember?\u201d \n\nFalcon\u2019s glare was beyond withering. \u201cDo you really think that I would kill you? These people want a REAL fight!\u201d He raised his arms to the invisible crowd, which let out a cheer like a gust of wind. \u201cNo, I planned for this.\u201d He threw a small vial of green liquid at Harpy, who caught it deftly in one hand. \n\n\u201cHarpy, you have been on enough trips with me, have you not? Know what to do?\u201d \n\nHarpy grinned fiercely, then downed the vial in a single gulp and threw it away, where it shattered on the metal floor. \u201cAye. Though I do wish it would be you who would drink one of these times.\u201d He shucked his robes in one fluid motion, leaving him in only a set of loose shorts. Immediately, it was apparent why: with a flare of red, his already oversized muscles began to grow, doubling and tripling in size along with his frame. Soon, he towered over the others, standing tall like the incarnation of some forgotten god of war. Glowing red tattoos spread over his skin like crimson flame, pulsing in rhythm with his heart.  \n\nFalcon, meanwhile, calmly strode to take his place on the far side of the arena. He showed no sign of outward transformation, but the steely glint in his eyes seemed to harden into diamond.  \n\n\nOwl and Sparrow, who had stepped to the very edge of the arena to watch, eyed each other nervously. \n\n\n\u201cIs he really going to kill him?\u201d Sparrow wondered aloud. \n\n\n\u201cHe just might.\u201d Owl replied, his voice solemn. \u201cYou might be new to this whole game, but Falcon has never been one to pull his punches. Neither is Harpy, for that matter. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if one of them got themselves killed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell!?\u201d Harpy boomed, his magnified voice echoing around the chamber like a thunderclap. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d \n\nFalcon dropped into a defensive stance. \u201cCome, old friend! Today, you die!\u201d \n\nHarpy bellowed and charged at Falcon, his enormous frame surprisingly fast for its bulk. Despite this, Falcon sidestepped neatly, ducking under Harpy\u2019s grasping arms. Again and again, Harpy struck \u2013 grapples, blows, kicks of all sorts \u2013 and yet none ever seemed to connect. The invisible crowd roared like distant thunder, the arena shaking from their excitement. \n\n\u201cFight back, you old fool!\u201d Harpy yelled, panting slightly. He charged again, trying to catch Falcon with a sweeping kick. Falcon simply leapt over it lightly and turned back toward him looking amused. \u201cFIGHT! BACK! If you don\u2019t fight soon, all of this will be for naugh-ah!\u201d Falcon struck him in the ribs with an open palm, cutting him off mid-sentence. \n\n\u201cAH! Like ice!\u201d Harpy growled, feeling where he had been struck gingerly. It smoked slightly, like it had been covered in dry ice. \u201cNot bad, not bad at all! But it will take more than that to put me down!\u201d \n\nHe charged again, but at the last moment he leapt back. The two circled each other, like a pair of wolves seeking dominance over the pack. \n\n\u201cI only need to hit you once, you know. Then it\u2019s lights out!\u201d Harpy grinned, showing a mouth full of pointed fangs. \u201cHow many times do you think you will have to hit *me*, eh feather punch?\u201d \n\n\nIt was Falcon\u2019s turn to smile. \u201cOh? And what makes you think I need to resort to basic punches?\u201d  \n\nHarpy\u2019s grin faded. He looked down at where he had been hit and cursed. From the epicenter of the punch, frost was blossoming like a snowflake over his skin. \u201cWhat did you do!?\u201d He yelled, taking a step back. \n\n\n\u201cOh, nothing much. You will be feeling it\u2019s effects soon.\u201d Falcon just kept on smiling, as his friend watched in horror as the mark steadily grew larger and larger. \u201cI have cooled your blood. I would say\u2026you have approximately two minutes before it reaches your heart? Plenty of time to beg for mercy, if you want. Not that I will be giving you any.\u201d\n\n \nHarpy\u2019s face went as pale as the ice on his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll just see who is begging for mercy.\u201d He roared again, throwing himself at Falcon with renewed fervor. Falcon went to dodge again, but this time Harpy flared red. Flames erupted from his body in all directions, bathing the combatants in white-hot light. Sparrow yelled, tipping backwards and shielding his eyes from the sight. Owl merely covered his face with his sleeve. \n\n\nWhen the light went out, the two men were lying in smoldering heaps on either side of the arena, pushed against the walls by the force of the blast. A large scorched circle marked the place that they had fought. Neither one was moving. \n\n\u201cDid they\u2026\u201d Sparrow started, but he was interrupted by a low moan. One of the men staggered to his feet. \u201cHarpy\u2026\u201d He groaned. \u201cThat was reckless.

Speak of him that way. Again.\u201d He growled, each word a whisper of barely controlled rage. \n\u201cIt burns like ice!\u201d Owl yelled, rubbing his face. A ruddy bruise was beginning to blossom on his cheek.\n\n\u201cGet up.\u201d Falcon spat. \u201cIf you were weak enough for that to do you in, I would have left you to the *Alran.*\u201d\n\nOwl stood, glaring. Grudgingly, he reached out and grabbed Harpy once more, and together they finished dragging him into the dark corridor. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Said Falcon as the doors began to close behind them. \u201cWe can open them again from this side much more easily. Hopefully this will delay our tail for longer than it did us.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Sparrow wondered aloud, dropping Harpy\u2019s hand. The room was circular, like the coliseum before, but it was much smaller. Depicted on every side were stylized etchings of the great lizard god *Alranil*, consuming sacrifices by the dozen. At the center of the room, the floor curved downward like a funnel into a pitch black hole. \n\n\u201cThis is the room above the pit where they sealed *Alranil.*\u201d Falcon explained, his expression returning somewhat to normal. \u201cThough she was forced to slumber, she did not rest quietly\u2026the losers of the blood matches were thrown into this pit as sacrifices, lest she destroy the entire construct in her sleep. They did better than those who came before: the civilization that built this chamber was great indeed.\u201d \n\nHe peered down into the black pit. \u201c\u2026but in the end, they, too failed to restrain her permanently.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d Grunted Owl, who was still rubbing his cheek. \u201cToss him down and be on our way?\u201d \n\nSurprisingly, Falcon smiled. \u201cNo, actually I think we should all go down there, don\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n\u201cAre you mad!?\u201d Owl raged. \u201cThat pit has to be hundreds of feet deep! We would be flattened!\u201d \nFalcon simply ignored him. \u201cFirst things first.\u201d He stated simply.

Without saying a word, he removed the glass stopper and emptied the vial\u2019s contents into Harpy\u2019s open mouth. \n\nImmediately, Harpy sat up and gasped for air. \u201cTook your bloody time, didn\u2019t you?\u201d He said, coughing as his lungs struggled to inhale the stagnant air. \u201cThought I was a gonner for real that time.\u201d \n\nFalcon scowled. \u201cThat was very reckless of you, Harpy.

Excellent work.\u201d Falcon smiled slightly. \u201cIf I am correct about where this pit leads, we will be needing you more than ever up ahead.\u201d \n\n\nSparrow flushed slightly at the complement. \u201cDon\u2026don\u2019t mention it.\u201d He hid his face in his hood, embarrased. \n\n\u201cSo what do you want us to do? Just jump?\u201d Owl questioned. \n\n\u201cHardly.\u201d Replied Faclon simply. Reaching into an inside pocket of his robe, he withdrew a small ring of metal bordered by two rubies on opposite sides. With a flick of his wrist, he flipped the ring like a coin down toward the center of the pit. It hung there, spinning so quickly that it looked like a sphere. All at once, twin bands of light leapt from the gemstones, creating a disc of red light that flickered like a laser. \n\n\u201cCool.\u201d Sparrow grinned, testing the platform with a foot. It sunk slightly under his weight, but remained solid enough for him to stand. \n\nThere was a loud crash from the other side of the gate, and the roaring of the crowd echoed around the chamber. \u201cHurry!

It shone a strange purple-white for a moment, then a bolt of force lanced out of the center of his palm like a ball of flame. When the projectile struck, it vanished without a trace. The doors merely rattled as if they had been struck with a breath of wind. \n\n\n\"As I thought.\" He murmered to himself over the din of the spirits. \"The *mithril* is very pure.

Every hair on his head was a strand of *mithril* thinner than any wire, and his eyes glowed an ominous ruby red . \n\n\n\n\"Well well. Looks like you want a bit of a fight, do you?\" Raven called. The figure remained silent, but grinned fiercely and drew a sword from his hip with a flourish. \n\n\"If I beat you, I get to go through, is that right?\" The figure nodded. \n\n\"Lets get to it then.\" Raven raised his palm once more, and fired a bolt of magic faster than blinking. The figure dodged, ducking under the bolt as easily as if it had been stationary. \n\n\n\"Quick, are you? How about THIS!\" Raven raised his other hand as well, and sent a wave of purple-white force toward his foe like a tidal wave. \"No dodging this time!\" \n\n\nThe figure just crossed it's arms and shook its head, opening its mouth in a silent laugh. The wave connected, but just as the wall had before it it simply vanished on contact with the *mithril* without leaving so much as a scratch. \n\n\n\"Well that answers THAT, I suppose.\" Raven scowled. \"I hoped that I could at least disrupt whatever magic keeps you going, but no such luck. Looks like we are going to do this the hard way.\" \n\n\nHe reached into a pocket on his belt, and - after a moment's rummaging - withdrew a curved sword of his own that could not have possibly fit inside of it. He spun it experimentally in his hand, making the air sing with the moving metal. \"You wanted a good fight? Bring it.\" \n\n\nThe figure charged. Metal met metal, and sparks flew as the swords collided with enough force to send Raven skidding backwards several feet. \"WHOA! Strong too!\" He paused a moment, then began to emanate an aura the color of burning coal. \"Lucky for me, I can be strong too.\" \n\n\nThis time, Raven rushed the metal man instead. With a flash of yellow light, he was upon him, swinging his sword overhead like a battleaxe. \n\nThe man ducked again and - with a panicked look on his face - dove under the surface of the *mithril* as if it were water. Raven's sword crashed down where he had been, sinking deep into the metal. \n\n\nHe grunted as he pulled the blade free. \"Have a few tricks up your sleeve, do you? Or are you taking the coward's way out?\" \n\n\n\nAcross the arena, the figure rose out of the metal like a living statue. The confident smirk that was on its face had been replaced with a scowl of pure hatred, and it seemed to be breathing heavily. \n\n\n\"Oh, did I touch a nerve?\" Raven sneered. \"Have a bit of a reputation to uphold, do you?\" \n\n\n\nWith a noiseless roar, the metal warrior sprang at Raven, skating on the surface of the arena as if it were ice. Their swords met, once more, but this time Raven's did not stop. In one fluid motion, he severed both the blade and its owner's head in two. \n\n\n\nThe arena went silent. \n\n\n\n\"You know, for the record...\" Said Raven as he walked towards the opening doors. \"I could have done that with your gate, too.\" \n\n\n", "id": "d32alqz"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d2bn9b9"}, {"comment": "\n#### Off Topic Comment Section ####\n\n---\n\nThis comment acts as a discussion area for the prompt.

Realizing that lying on this comfortable bed would quickly bring me back to slumberland, I quickly sat up, the sudden rush giving me black spots in my vision.

This bedroom made of white marble is bigger than the house I lived in! From wall to wall, it had to have been more than forty feet, no, fifty! The room is furnished to such an extent, that I couldn\u2019t tell reality apart from fantasy. Hell, even all the shows and movies about medieval kings couldn\u2019t top this. Everything, from lounging chairs to bookcase was encrusted with gold. Wait a minute; I narrowed my eyes to see in the distance (it is pretty far, mind you), by an immaculately polished door, no.

My jaw opened slightly in, rather, disgust, in fact, everything was just so overwhelmingly extravagant, I felt a sudden pang of extreme guilt and shame for even being allowed to be in this room, let alone wake up in it.\n\nThe excessive golden d\u00e9cor aside, I was not done being surprised yet. I looked down only to be greeted with a pair of excellently-shaped, fleshy lumps that have dominated the majority of my waking life ever since I was a wee baby. Of course, they were covered by some of the smoothest fabric I ever felt, but the sight cannot be unseen. You have no idea how I felt, because honestly, I didn\u2019t know either. It was a puzzling feeling of mixed emotions because I instinctively also noticed a lack of pressure in the nether regions of my body, which my brain, of course, reacted with a grief panic of \u201cWhere did my dick go?!

A quintuplet of similarly dressed women in what appears to be black and white uniforms adorned with gold trimmings and laces marched toward me. One lady lead the way while the other four spread behind her, each of them carrying something in their arms. The one in front wore a solemn face, as if nothing in the world would upset her, but despite that, she had a mature allure to her.\n\n\u201cExcuse our rudeness for interrupting the Royal Princess\u2019s slumber and eschewing traditional morning rituals, but we have been commanded by His Majesty to not delay any longer,\u201d the head maid delivered curtly, \u201cThese four maids behind me are all ready and waiting to assist you in preparations. Do please excuse our rudeness, for the sudden entrance. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I shall be on my way to address other important matters.\u201d\n\nBefore I could utter a sound, the head maid already left the room and the other four maids deftly guided me out of bed and over towards a corner of the room. \n\n\u201cUmm, hi, uh, boy this may seem a bit weird, but I hope you understand,\u201c the pearl white night gown flew upwards as one maid behind me undressed me before I could even find the nearest mirror, \u201cUhhh, how do I explain this? I know you\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy, but who cares, this situation is already more than strange so\u2026\u201d\n\nThe four maids worked quickly and silently. None of them ever made eye contact with me, let alone show a single expression. If this were a poker game, I\u2019d be dead meat. \n\n\u201cI am not the princess you think I am. You got it?\u201d the maids continued with their deadpan work of dressing me in this awfully tight and frilly light golden dress, \u201cI\u2019m being serious here. I only woke up this morning like this. I mean you should have seen what I looked like before this. Seriously! I had hair, like, all over my body, and, you won\u2019t believe this, but I was a dude.\u201d\n\nI instinctively shut my eyes preparing for some sort of admonishment or outright laughter, but the silence persisted. Before I knew it, I could feel my rib cage being crushed from an oppressive pressure as the four maids quickly finished dressing me in the most uncomfortable thing in the world. Well, maybe their silence means they are okay with what I just said? I could only ponder it briefly because the maids escorted me out the door.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m definitely not done getting surprised today, was the only thing I was thinking as I strutted awkwardly for what seems like ages. If I thought that the bedroom was huge and extravagant, I must\u2019ve forgot that for a bedroom to exist, there must be a large structure that holds it within. Forget about structure, this was like a mega fortress that was made up of a couple hundred other fortresses. The opulence in every hallway, every passing room, even the servants\u2019 manner and dress, was taken to the extreme, and then some. I quickly lost count of how many exquisitely polished doors I passed during my tour, but before me, stood the largest, most intricately carved door I have ever witnessed in my life. It was definitely made of some sort of stone, probably marble from the near-reflective shine on it. I couldn\u2019t help but shudder from the insignificance I felt from approaching such an intimidating, yet not living thing. I couldn\u2019t help but dread what I\u2019ve gotten myself into.\n\nI jumped a little when the entire ground shook. The opening of the doors create so much friction that the near vicinity quakes from the sheer enormity of the task. That was beside the point, I can\u2019t believe those giant stone slabs could even move.\n\nAfter waiting a minute for the doors to open, a long flight of stairs beckoned me. After all that walking and now a huge flight of stairs? If I am a princess, where the hell is my chariot? Why do I have to walk so much and this dress is so damn uncomfortable that I might even puke. Huh? Wait, I actually do feel a bit nauseous. Oh man this torment is awful. What did I eat last night? My belly aches with such a sharp, yet dull pain. Now that I am climbing this flight of stairs, the ache only hurts worse. Ah shit, don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m having a period. Now I kind of regret my decision.\nI bumped into the maid in front of me as my train of thought abruptly ended. I stopped and looking around, I knew this room was serious business. With a door like that, how couldn\u2019t it be? There were pairs of wide golden pillars opposite each other that that lead to a throne atop a high, stepped platform carved from one single block of marble. The throne seat was as glamorous as they come, with an intricate tree branching design that reached all the way to the ceiling. Of course, gold was the aesthetic of choice. \n\n"], [1, "[removed]"]], [[{"comment": "My first writing prompt ever. I hope it is enjoyable to read!\n\nHmmm. This ceiling is definitely unfamiliar.

I know you\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy, but who cares, this situation is already more than strange so\u2026\u201d\n\nThe four maids worked quickly and silently. None of them ever made eye contact with me, let alone show a single expression. If this were a poker game, I\u2019d be dead meat. \n\n\u201cI am not the princess you think I am. You got it?\u201d the maids continued with their deadpan work of dressing me in this awfully tight and frilly light golden dress, \u201cI\u2019m being serious here. I only woke up this morning like this. I mean you should have seen what I looked like before this. Seriously! I had hair, like, all over my body, and, you won\u2019t believe this, but I was a dude.\u201d\n\nI instinctively shut my eyes preparing for some sort of admonishment or outright laughter, but the silence persisted. Before I knew it, I could feel my rib cage being crushed from an oppressive pressure as the four maids quickly finished dressing me in the most uncomfortable thing in the world. Well, maybe their silence means they are okay with what I just said? I could only ponder it briefly because the maids escorted me out the door.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m definitely not done getting surprised today, was the only thing I was thinking as I strutted awkwardly for what seems like ages. If I thought that the bedroom was huge and extravagant, I must\u2019ve forgot that for a bedroom to exist, there must be a large structure that holds it within. Forget about structure, this was like a mega fortress that was made up of a couple hundred other fortresses. The opulence in every hallway, every passing room, even the servants\u2019 manner and dress, was taken to the extreme, and then some. I quickly lost count of how many exquisitely polished doors I passed during my tour, but before me, stood the largest, most intricately carved door I have ever witnessed in my life. It was definitely made of some sort of stone, probably marble from the near-reflective shine on it. I couldn\u2019t help but shudder from the insignificance I felt from approaching such an intimidating, yet not living thing. I couldn\u2019t help but dread what I\u2019ve gotten myself into.\n\nI jumped a little when the entire ground shook. The opening of the doors create so much friction that the near vicinity quakes from the sheer enormity of the task. That was beside the point, I can\u2019t believe those giant stone slabs could even move.\n\nAfter waiting a minute for the doors to open, a long flight of stairs beckoned me. After all that walking and now a huge flight of stairs? If I am a princess, where the hell is my chariot? Why do I have to walk so much and this dress is so damn uncomfortable that I might even puke. Huh? Wait, I actually do feel a bit nauseous. Oh man this torment is awful. What did I eat last night? My belly aches with such a sharp, yet dull pain. Now that I am climbing this flight of stairs, the ache only hurts worse. Ah shit, don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m having a period. Now I kind of regret my decision.\nI bumped into the maid in front of me as my train of thought abruptly ended. I stopped and looking around, I knew this room was serious business. With a door like that, how couldn\u2019t it be? There were pairs of wide golden pillars opposite each other that that lead to a throne atop a high, stepped platform carved from one single block of marble. The throne seat was as glamorous as they come, with an intricate tree branching design that reached all the way to the ceiling. Of course, gold was the aesthetic of choice. \n\n", "id": "d2pr3wf"}, {"comment": "Upon the throne sat a man cloaked in white fur, a golden jeweled crown atop his head. He sported an expertly trimmed beard that could only enhance his regality. His sharp, stern eyes display a clear message of fortitude that decries his awful fashion sense. His outer garb under his cloak is a pattern of gold and black stripes that could only remind me of a bumblebee. His trousers were even worse. It had the same color pattern, but the style was like that of the trousers that were baggy except for the tight elastic fit around the waist and ankles. \n\nI stifled my laughter as his voice bellowed from above, \u201cMimosa Unverlee Danicatherine Du\u2019Yottest,\u201d what the fuck that\u2019s my name? Who the hell decided that? \u201cMy daughter, the 128th child of the Du\u2019Yottest royal family,\u201d Are you shitting me? 128th? What\u2019s the point of keeping count anymore if you\u2019re gonna bang every woman you see, \u201cI have finally settled that business with that meddlesome priest about starvashuh-something or other so now I can dedicate my time to finding my lovely daughter a suitable husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, what? Er, I mean, Ah yes, Your Holiness. A husband. Yes.\u201d I agreed impulsively.\n\n\u201cWhat? Your Holiness? What kind of a ridiculous slur are you calling me? I know you are my daughter, but there are certain limits to such things, and to address your King as such, have your tutors taught you anything?\u201d\n\nI reeled in panic as I could hear the ire in his tone, \u201cI am deeply sorry, uhh, Your Majesty, for being so rude. I, uh, had trouble sleeping last night so, um, I haven\u2019t fully woken up yet. Yeah, that\u2019s what happened. Please forgive me. Plus I\u2019m also on my period I think.\u201d As soon as the words slipped out, my hands covered my mouth and I cringed in a mixture of embarrassment and fear.\n\nI could only stare at the floor, the immaculately maintained floor, as I stood in dead silence. \u201cWell, it\u2019s clear to me that I\u2019ve made a mistake somewhere along the line. No matter, I\u2019ll just have all your tutors and servants tortured until the perpetrators confess their sins of teaching such vulgar behavior to one who is of royal blood. Of course they shall suffer a painful and merciless death, but not until they watch their own kin go first,\u201d I was paralyzed to the core as a cold sweat permeated my body. \u201cYou heard me, Commander, now go and complete the task.\u201d\nI could hear a clang of metal plates as what appears to be a heavily armored soldier marching away from the side of the King, my father, with the intent of carrying out his orders. Otherwise, the only other sound in this hollow hall was the thumping of my heart that seemed to pulse faster with each breath.\n\n\u201cI hate leaving business unfinished so I just decided on a suitable husband for my lovely daughter. You see, there is this ruler on the other side of the mountain range that also possesses a sizable army that could prove to be a nuisance were they to turn hostile. Rather than deal with such a troublesome matter, the right course of action would be to prevent the flames from ever igniting in the first place. My informants have told me with certainty that this king, hmmm, how should I put it? This king seems to favor young women strongly. He especially has a fondness for pure girls who haven\u2019t seen much of the world. After all, a king deserves only the finest of things, and a beautiful, pure, virgin maiden are one of the top five things in the world, or so he says,\u201d the King proclaimed.\n\nI swallowed in apprehension as my weak voice uttered aloud, \u201cI-i-is it Your Majesty\u2019s wish for this king to be my future husband?\u201d\n\n\u201cPah!\u201d His voice rang out in a guffaw, \u201cHow presumptuous of you my daughter. I was right in ordering the tortures of your tutors, they clearly haven\u2019t been doing a sufficient job. No, you are to be wed to one of that king\u2019s sons. I don\u2019t really know which one, and I can care less since you and eight of your other sisters are also being wed off to his sons. Marrying off only one daughter has its limits but nine? That will certainly secure peace between our two kingdoms. Now I just need your consent and then this matter shall be settled once and for all.\u201d\n\nMy heart dropped after listening to his words. I only woke up an hour ago and I\u2019m being married off to the son of some lustful king I\u2019ve never met in a body I\u2019ve never been in before and in a situation I never imagined myself being in. I still couldn\u2019t muster the courage to look up. The expectation of a dutiful reply hung in the air as if time stood still, and it certainly didn\u2019t help that the period I am experiencing at the moment took a turn for the worse. I felt faint, the agonizing pain added with the pressure of an uncertain future, made me shudder uncontrollably.\n\n\u201cDo not keep Your King waiting. What is your answer, daughter?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth a couple times before a hoarse voice crept up, \u201cAh, my answer\u2026\u201d despite understanding my situation fully, I couldn\u2019t help but to be docile, \u201cThank you Your Majesty for choosing such a suitable husband for someone as undeserving as me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTch, you speak like a peasant,\u201d the irritation in his tone rang through, \u201cIt figures that in reality, everything can\u2019t be as you want it to be, even if you are king. At least I can always sire more children. You may leave now.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*****\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[In a large room filled with various advanced machinery and monitors]\n\nTwo men, dressed in white lab coats, stood in front of several monitors conversing excitedly.\n\n\u201cOh. My. God. I can\u2019t believe he said yes. And did you see how he said it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know right? \u2018Yes Your Majesty, thank you for choosing a husband for someone so undeserving as me.\u2019 That line is classic. Dude, you gotta record this and show the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cHell yeah! Why didn\u2019t I think of that? This shit is gonna explode on the net! Hey go get a memory drive, there should be tons in the supply room.\u201d\n\nOne man sprinted to the door while the other began tinkering with the machines.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*****\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cCarl, why the hell would you do that? You know that every change of a parameter is recorded by a surveillance system. Hell, everything is under surveillance these days.

I mean, sure, he paid a lot for it, but with an opportunity like that in front of me, how can you expect me to stop? Did you know that he let out some deadly, but silent gas one time in a crowded elevator, and blamed me for it? People started avoiding me and all fart-related occurrences thereafter would start with the comment that I must\u2019ve done it. Of course I take it as a joke, but it really hurts man. I mean my gas doesn\u2019t even smell that bad. You should know, you\u2019re my brother, Jim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026 Thanks for reminding me. But still man, seriously? You could have been more subtle.\u201d Jim retorted.\n\n\u201cI know, I know. At least you know why I got fired now,\u201d Carl sighed, \u201cso...
