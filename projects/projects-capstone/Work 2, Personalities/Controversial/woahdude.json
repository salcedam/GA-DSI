I hope you can see how my speculation came up somewhat short - I realize that the internet is at its core a bunch of *wired* connections, but due to the ease that this is turned into wif which is transmitted through radio waves, I figured that the wired connection of the internet was just a physical way to transmit something similar to radio waves. I also knew that of what exists of Marie Curie's lab is extremely dangerous to this day due to the radiation. I also knew that gamma waves and radio waves differ only in wavelength & frequency. I also know that Marie Curie's notebooks are not available on the internet. So, I incorrectly deduced that the reason they haven't been uploaded to the internet is because the extreme radiation of Marie Curie's notebooks, if in the wrong hands, could be used to distort wi fi signals to make them radioactive. As I'm actually typing this out to try and explain the logic I was using I realize how totally and utterly ridiculous it sounds, and as you can tell my knowledge of technology is woefuly inadequate. Maybe you could be more specific in filling the gaps in my knowledge? What exactly is stopping a hacker of some kind from adjusting a radio wave to make it into a gamma wave?

While it is true it does impact the foreground and background plane of focus, the amount in this photo is EXTREMELY exaggerated, and is misleading in how it works.\n\nHere's something that shows the impact on foreground and background: http://i.imgur.com/FcrRunZ.jpg I took my large format camera to Mid Ohio for the 2014 Indy Race. I didn't have any film left, but I did have some Polaroid film and an instant film back for my 4x5, so I took that with me. Anyway, notice how the guys head, next to the Ferrari (swell chap by the way, it took me a few minutes to get the shot dialed in, and right when I was ready to release the shutter, the toe strap went on. I asked if they could wait, and he told the tow driver to wait a second)? It's out of focus. But look at the white tent compared to the red inflatable arche thing. The reason why the difference is more dramatic there is because focus is dependent on the distance between lens elements, and the distance between the final lens element, and the film plane. Since that distance is changing due to the tilt of the lens, different areas of the lens that are closer or further to the film plane are going to have different planes of focus. As well since the plane of focus (the part of the image that doesn't have bokeh) is also relative to object distance, it becomes another multiplier to impact depth of field, and tilt shift effects.\n\nHow tilt shifting effects focus is that the lens itself is moving, part of it's closer to the film plane than another part, this will cause different parts of the image to be more in and out of focus. However the posted image implies that it somehow creates a extremely dense mass inside the camera capable of bending light to the will of the lens.\n\nIt's just the lens moving. It's not magic. It's not new. It's been around way longer than even 35mm film. This image implies it works differently than it does, and since I'm a dork that shoots large format, I like to explain things! I also know the average person doesn't have the time to read an essay, so bottom lining and glossing over details is good enough. If someone is inspired to learn more, they can do their own research to get a better understanding. Or read further down in the comments and read this.\n\nHere's something with like graphs and shit explaining it all good and not word vomitly: http://cow.mooh.org/projects/tiltshift/howdoesitwork.html\n\nIf you want to see some absolute mastery of the large format medium, and tilt shift, check this out: http://www.davidburnett.com/gallery.html?gallery=London+2012+%2F+Olympics#/0\n\nDavid Burnett took a large format camera to the 2012 Summer Olympics because he is awesome. Some of these shots show you the utility of tilt shift, and how it can impact an image. I am a complete amateur compared to him. I only recently had to buy more storage sleeves for large format film because despite having done it for three years I've only shot about 200 exposures. Large format is time consuming, cumbersome, and difficult. The fact that this guy can get beautiful shots when you really, really only have one chance. It takes about 10 seconds to flip the negative holder, and after that ten seconds, you gotta fumble around and grab another one, 'cause there's only one negative per side. You have to pick and choose your shots, doing that for event photography and sports is yowza. Doing that with tilt shift where only 40% of the image is going to be in focus anyway, that's mastery.

I think a realistic, believable effect can be recreated in Photoshop, it would just take a bit more work than applying a filter.

When you look at the image, you can certainly see where it gets instantly blurred, not looking natural at all (generally it would go slowly from sharp to blurry, because the blurred objects would go farther away from the focus point) and it ruins the photo IMO. \n\n[Here is what I'm talking about, look at that ugly mess](https://oliviazsebik.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/zsebikshutterspeed-17artificalblur.jpg), the picture is just pure tragedy, if the photographer left it as it was, there possibly would be some background blur, which would highlight the girl, this way he made her look like some creature from your worst nightmares.", "id": "d1vavsb"}, {"comment": "That's...that's not even an attempt at an instagram tilt shift effect.

So if I'm shooting a landscape shot, the entire frame beyond 3 meters is in focus even if the foreground is 5 meters away and the mountains in the background are 25 km away.\n\nTilt shift is a method by which an extremely narrow depth of field is achieved even at great distances, which tricks the eye (and brain) into perceiving the photo as being of something tiny.

The \"tilt-shift\" effect artificially brings focus falloff into a shot that is not nearly close/macro/small enough to normally achieve a shallow depth of field.\n\nTilt-shift lenses actually have a hinge for both axis, allowing the focal plane to be manipulated so that the view of the camera can actually look down the length of the focal plane, like lowering your head to look along the surface of a table as opposed to looking straight down on it. Instead of objects simply being out of focus based on their distance from you, focus will be based on how far something is on either side of your tweaked focal plane.\n\nhttp://www.bobatkins.com/photography/reviews/macro_tilt_adapter/tilt.jpg\n\nhttp://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4851246349_a4411b421a_o.png\n\n\n\nThus, you can add massive amounts of faux depth-of-field to even a photograph of a massive mountain, giving it the feel of it being photographed with a macro lens when you cut the focal plane right through your subject.", "id": "d1v7ln8"}, {"comment": "Everything looks like mini models from the ISS :)", "id": "d1w8hkv"}, {"comment": "NASA is strictly #nofilter", "id": "d1v7s1x"}, {"comment": "WONT YOU BE...MY NEIGHBOR", "id": "d1vapql"}, {"comment": "This happened in a Reddit thread.", "id": "d1vbn91"}, {"comment": "Oh...

What happens is when the starch is heated up quickly in oil, the starch begins to expand and swell, and with water escaping through steam, locks it in solid. \n\nEven more interesting is that there are actually [two types of starch molecules, amylose and amylopectin](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/8360-why-starch-gets-crispy-when-fried), which cross-link with each other at high temperatures, giving further structure to your starch body, which gives you your 'crack' when under stress and fracture, making it feel even crispier!\n\nSource: bored Asian, likes noodles", "id": "d1bj99r"}], [{"comment": "Literally said woah", "id": "d1bisjy"}], [{"comment": "Sorta what tapeworms coming out of your butt looks like", "id": "d1bixzd"}], [{"comment": "This is shallow frying.", "id": "d1bkdj2"}], [{"comment": "sigh at op, i miss the good days of this sub reddit", "id": "d1blqyf"}]]], "4nnix6": ["Lighting incense with a Plasma-Lighter.", "2016-06-12 02:14:52", 306, "http://imgur.com/gallery/KyY6eGx/new", [[57, "[deleted]"], [30, "TIL Plasma lighters exist & I want one."], [24, "[I would constantly be making this face](http://i.imgur.com/uVyCNN9.png?1)"], [22, "[deleted]"], [10, "Unfortunately they make an awful noise."], [8, "I almost want to smoke cigarettes again just to get this.

"], [54, "Hello. I am currently a graduate student who is working on examining the role of zinc release during fertilization. I am not an author of this specific paper, but of one our previously released papers: [Quantitative mapping of zinc fluxes in the mammalian egg reveals the origin of fertilization-induced zinc sparks.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25615666)\n\nThe above image was taken from a recently published paper [The zinc spark is an inorganic signature of human egg activation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27113677). This is a human egg that has been chemically fertilized (no sperm) to mimic what happens when the sperm meets the egg. The scientists here used calcium-ionomycin to activate egg. Calcium ionomycin is an ionophore that transports calcium into the cell. During actual fertilization calcium enters and exists the cytosol of a cell in a waves and kicks off the process to create the zygote and the eventual embryo. Calcium ionophore allows us to trick the cell into undergoing one of these waves, thereby starting the process artificially.\n\nInside the egg is a dye that responds to calcium, that is the rainbow change that you are seeing occur over time and how you know the calcium-ionophore has worked to \"fertilize\" the egg. Outside the cell is a zinc-responsive dye. This dye is charged so it cannot enter the cell. The yellow flash around the egg is the dye responding to the zinc being released. \n\nAs a note, while this study with human eggs does not show sperm, we have shown previously that sperm induces the zinc release in mouse eggs: [The fertilization-induced zinc spark is a novel biomarker of mouse embryo quality and early development.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987302).\n\nSo what is causing the zinc to be released from these eggs? The calcium from the cytosol inside the egg is inducing a series of vesicles to be released from the egg. We have shown in our initial discovery of this phenomenon that zinc release occurs following the calcium transients: [Zinc availability regulates exit from meiosis in maturing mammalian oocytes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20693991). \n\nWhy must the egg release zinc and what does it do? Quite simply we do not know. Part my research is to determine that.\n\nWhy is this discovery important? The hope is to use the zinc release as a marker for embryo quality and develop non-invasive tools to monitor zinc release during in vitro fertilization for couples who are having problems conceiving. There is currently no clinical non-invasive method to determine the quality of an embryo before it is implanted in a woman. These discoveries would allow us to create a method, thereby allowing few embryos to be implanted into a woman (reducing the chance of twins, triplets, etc.), as well as allowing for less cycles of IVF trials to be needed (reduced costs, stress, etc.).\n\nIf you have any questions about this research or the above gif, please feel free to ask."], [49, "http://i.imgur.com/DtaZf0P.gifv"], [47, "TIL The Flash is present at conception"], [41, "What if the light we see when we die is the flash of us sperminating the egg for our next life?"], [29, "Checkmate, atheists!"], [22, "Perverts."], [17, "Why does this \"zinc spark\" happen?"], [15, "[deleted]"], [9, "Meh.

I am currently a graduate student who is working on examining the role of zinc release during fertilization. I am not an author of this specific paper, but of one our previously released papers: [Quantitative mapping of zinc fluxes in the mammalian egg reveals the origin of fertilization-induced zinc sparks.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25615666)\n\nThe above image was taken from a recently published paper [The zinc spark is an inorganic signature of human egg activation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27113677). This is a human egg that has been chemically fertilized (no sperm) to mimic what happens when the sperm meets the egg. The scientists here used calcium-ionomycin to activate egg. Calcium ionomycin is an ionophore that transports calcium into the cell. During actual fertilization calcium enters and exists the cytosol of a cell in a waves and kicks off the process to create the zygote and the eventual embryo. Calcium ionophore allows us to trick the cell into undergoing one of these waves, thereby starting the process artificially.\n\nInside the egg is a dye that responds to calcium, that is the rainbow change that you are seeing occur over time and how you know the calcium-ionophore has worked to \"fertilize\" the egg. Outside the cell is a zinc-responsive dye. This dye is charged so it cannot enter the cell. The yellow flash around the egg is the dye responding to the zinc being released. \n\nAs a note, while this study with human eggs does not show sperm, we have shown previously that sperm induces the zinc release in mouse eggs: [The fertilization-induced zinc spark is a novel biomarker of mouse embryo quality and early development.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987302).\n\nSo what is causing the zinc to be released from these eggs? The calcium from the cytosol inside the egg is inducing a series of vesicles to be released from the egg. We have shown in our initial discovery of this phenomenon that zinc release occurs following the calcium transients: [Zinc availability regulates exit from meiosis in maturing mammalian oocytes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20693991). \n\nWhy must the egg release zinc and what does it do? Quite simply we do not know. Part my research is to determine that.\n\nWhy is this discovery important? The hope is to use the zinc release as a marker for embryo quality and develop non-invasive tools to monitor zinc release during in vitro fertilization for couples who are having problems conceiving. There is currently no clinical non-invasive method to determine the quality of an embryo before it is implanted in a woman. These discoveries would allow us to create a method, thereby allowing few embryos to be implanted into a woman (reducing the chance of twins, triplets, etc.), as well as allowing for less cycles of IVF trials to be needed (reduced costs, stress, etc.).\n\nIf you have any questions about this research or the above gif, please feel free to ask.", "id": "d2jip1h"}], [{"comment": "http://i.imgur.com/DtaZf0P.gifv", "id": "d2jafu9"}], [{"comment": "TIL The Flash is present at conception", "id": "d2j8wmx"}, {"comment": "Unless the mother is an iPhone user.", "id": "d2j9kru"}, {"comment": "No, just Jay Garrick", "id": "d2jaazy"}, {"comment": "Haven't you heard?
