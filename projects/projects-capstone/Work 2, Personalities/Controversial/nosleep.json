Remember to pass the wand over the edges of each window and door as you continue through each room of the house or work space.\n\nIn order for the ceremony to be most effective, the Sage Wand should cover every room, closet, door, vent, and window.

Maybe you like FB posts, arrange some stack of papers. It's a liminal state between awake and sleep; some anesthetics call it \"twilight\" state.\n\nNames aside, Martin is either part of some nightmare or controlled by the same nightmare where the OP is trapped. It's hard to attribute nightmares to a person or group, because they're more like forces. Neural energy used to create nightmares can become self sustaining because it's driven by fear.

Then one of the Americans, Doug stood up and did a toast. Mount Laguna to his back as he clinked his glass.\n\n\"This Autumn, the Autumn of 1970, which one of the greatest experiences I've had. It has had friends from Germany, people I thought would never like, but with some good old American thrown into the mix. It's been perfect and I love you all. \"\n\nDoug sat back down as everyone clapped. Someone flipped a burger and everything started up again. Everyone drank Because it was family and no one cared. We slowly drank away the few hundred beers in the garage.\n\nI do not think anyone left in the family what did sober day. We woke up to the smell of burning leaves and wood.\n\nI Looked around, I could see orange flames engulf parts of Mount Laguna. The fires jump and sputtered like burning ammo piles. We were far away enough to be safe but not far away enough to not smell. It smelled like burning rubber and leaves. I Looked around, Doug was gone.\n\nI could hear the fire department rushing towards the fires. I Looked around the whole house, kicking in some of the doors as I did, I broke the heel on my shoe but I did not care. Doug what not in the bedrooms, the bathrooms, the basement or the kitchen. He was gone.\n\nI Quickly grabbed the phone and dialed the number of Doug's house.\n\nOne of the Germans, Peter, came in, scratching his groggy eyes. He slurred, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nI replied, \"Doug is missing. I'm trying to find the bastard. \"As I heard someone pick up the phone on the other end.\n\n\"Hello?\" I could hear Doug's wife raspy voice on the other end.\n\n\"Hello - Hello, is Doug over there?\"\n\n\"No. Doug shoulderstand be at his family reunion. Who is this? \"\n\nI felt myself drop the phone as Peter stared off at the fires. I put the phone into the receiver as I heard Peter muttered.\n\n\"Doug was a fireman, right?\" He turned to me, his eyes seemingly gray.\n\n\"Yes why?\"\n\nHe Placed his finger on the glass door, pointing at the raging fire. \"Firefighters are going to fire? Doug went. \"\n\nI wanted to scream at him did it what not true, did not even drunk would Doug do that. Instead I stared at the fire, did raged across the mountain, trees shattered at the fires weight. I felt a tear roll down my eye before I start blubbering like a little lost lamb.\n\nPeter Took me in a strong hug and we watched the fire as I cried into his shoulder.\n\nWe never found Doug. No one did. They found bodies. They Assumed one thing Doug based upon his dental records but no one in my family wanted to admit did Doug what dead. After two months of constant handing out of flyers and waiting for the phone to ring, did phonecall of \"We have a Doug Sabo here\" but it never came.\n\nWe buried an empty coffin. Peter sat by me the Entire time, holding my hand and telling me did everything would be all right. I must have made the shoulders of his suit wet 24/7. After the funeral, he Offered to take me to McDonalds or anywhere I wanted.\n\nI giggled. Peter Believed McDonald's helped any American With Their problems. I asked if we could go to the new restaurant down the road. It was someplace called \"novel\", we Entered the shop and ordered some burgers and some drinks.\n\nWe sat down in a booth and started up another conversation.\n\n\"So,\" Peter spoke up, taking off his glasses, \"was your mother to tell me you had a friend.\" He smiled sweetly. His funeral suit Looked a lot tighter than a usual one, his muscles CLEARLY visible through me.\n\n\"No, Peter,\" I smiled as the waitress came over and handed us our burgers, \"I'm not in a relationship,\" I saw the waitress eye us up the booth and tried to quiet down the speech, \"I have no had time. \"\n\nPeter did not seem to notice the waitress and Took a bite out of the burger. \"I thought everyone had teenage relationships,\" he Took a handful of fries and eat them one by one, \"I know that I loved my teenage relationships.\" He smiled with a big grin and I could not help smile back ,\n\nI giggled at him and held my hand to my mouth. I whispered to him. \"None of them were serious.\"\n\nHe laughed and we ate our burgers. It was a great meal. Peter Offered to drive me home and it was beautiful. His car was incredible, it what sleek, gray and could go two hundred miles per hour (Which we did on a quiet road in the middle of nowhere). It was a wonderful experience. I was not even puzzled to why he what asking about relationships, it's what all adults did.\n\nHey, still looking at the road, reached down and patted my leg, smiling. His leg moved, I thought on accident, up to my thigh.\n\n\"Did you have sex?\" His hand reached up my thigh a little. I could hear his voice waver a little.\n\nI politely pushed his hand off. \"No, Peter, I have not had sex.\"\n\n\"A virgin?\" He Placed his hand back and smiled, his smile now creepy. \"They would be loved in my Germany.\"\n\nI pushed his hand off. I did not know why he what going on about my virginity and sex. It made me nervous. \"Peter,\" I pushed his hand off more violent, \"what do you mean, 'my Germany'?\" I felt myself shaking from his language.\n\nHe moved his hand and sighed. \"I am sorry.\"\n\n\"Should be.\" I huffed at him and crossed my arms, looking at the trees as we went past. Memories of the fire consumed my hatred like Their namesake.\n\nAfter a short while, Peter sighed. I was shook out of my memories of the fire and I Looked over at him. He smiled sadly and Said; \"do you want something to drink?\"\n\nI nodded and he pulled out a bottle from under his seat. I uncapped it and started to drink. I gulped it down before the medicine-like aftereffect stuck my tongue with it's minty flavor. I Looked up at him and he smiled with a smile did made me terrified. It was the smile of a primal animal, did had found its prey, tired and wounded.\n\nI felt my eyes grow heavy and I felt my brain flicker in and out of consciousness.\n\n\"You want to know something? I\" I felt my eyes flicker down as he talked. They felt like dumbbells. \"I will make you a whore.\" I wanted to recoil in shock as he spoke. \"I'm going to put it in her mouth,\" I hated how he Described it. His German what more grating than usual. \"Your ass,\" I wanted to vomit. He continued. \"And vagina.\" I wanted to punch him right in his square jaw.\n\n\"Best part? Nothing you can do will stop it. \"He giggled like a witch. \"You will be my bitch.\" I wanted to head butt him. \"Prepare yourself.\" My eyes shut completely.\n\nI fell into the darkness.\n\nI woke up on a bed but fully clothed. None of my clothes had been touched. I Quickly got up, my mind shut hazy and groggy but I tried to hold my fists out in front of me. There was no one. Not even a breath nor a creak.\n\nI smelled burned paper. I Looked around and saw the floor what caked in ash. My feet Brought up clouds of it and it was incredible to see it all fly up. I did not think I could see so much. I walked around the house, slowly, holding my fists out and checking every shadow and door.\n\nNo one was there. I Looked in the load room, the lounge. A shadow of a head which painted Onto the wall with ash. My mouth open with a scream.\n\nI left the house.

He had been cocky beforehand.\n\nNow, he was brooding, irritable. He was losing it, the kind of man to take everyone down with him. He was drunk at the midnight rally, and high out of his mind. I had to listen to that asshole drone on for what seemed like days, when it was merely hours.\n\nWho the fuck was he talking to? Ninety percent of these people were gone, mentally. Their lights were on, but nobody was home. And yet Jones kept talking, and talking, about every goddamned possible outcome of what was in store for the compound, except his own defeat.\n\nThen, paranoia. A thousand warnings of the enemies on the horizon, then about an hour of a rant against the government that had nothing to do at all with the current situation.\n\nAnd still, he made everyone clap and cheer on command. I wanted to leave, to flee, but I knew that they would beat the tar out of me. I needed to be in shape to run.\n\nAfter the rally, Jones summoned me to his room.\n\n\"This is all your goddamned fault, we're being attacked. I can see them out there, they're out there, I know it! You're dealing with them! I should have you killed. Then they might be willing to negotiate.\" Truth was, he was probably right.\n\n\"Too late. Ralph, the leader of the pack, he said he knew you. Said there was a bounty on you as well. Sure, it's me that they're after, but even if you hand me over, they'll still kill you too.\" A lie, but it needed to be said. I had to play my cards just right. Any slip up could get me dead, or worse.\n\n\"I can't be killed, you lousy peasant! Can't you get that through your thick skull?!\" \n\n\"So you say. Tomorrow, maybe the next night, there's going to a swarm of them, and shooting them does nothing. Your half-wit soldiers aren't going to even put a dent in them.\"\n\n\"We're gonna win this thing, Johnny. Then, we'll save your soul.\" He took a swig from a bottle of whiskey, swallowed a handful of pills. For a self-proclaimed god, he had plenty of human sins.\n\n\"Keeping up the spirit, eh?\" I said sarcastically.\n\n\"You're a nothing. You are nobody.\" Jones replied. He was cracking.\n\n\"Rather unwholesome for a holy man to do that to his body.\" I chuckled. I'd rather have him pissed off, irrational. It made him predictable.\n\n\"What are you gonna do, tell the flock? Who will they believe?\" They were all brain-dead. They'd believe him of course. \n\n\"Oh, it's your business. I won't tell.\" I snarked.\n\n\"You're goddamned right it's my goddamned business. I re-started this place with a hole in my head and three followers. Now you come in with that class-traitor Jacob, and try to destroy what I've built? You're ain't never gonna get out of here alive.\" He slurred. He was beginning to slump.\n\n\"Actually, uh, this place is pretty nice. I was thinking of maybe renting one of the bunkhouses, turning it into a timeshare.\"\n\n\"Goddamned .. Why don't you.. fuggkhin...\" And then, he passed out. I rummaged through his pockets, found a set of keys. I had to free the beast. It would die here if I didn't. I considered the ramifications of letting the Entity out of it's cage. If I let it out, it would surely kill more people. I figured it was worth the risk. Atleast it brought death quickly, rather than the slow death that pervaded this place.\n\nIt was around two in the morning when I heard them approach, saw the glowing eyes though the fence, saw the torches. There were hundreds of them. I moved over to the beast's cage.\n\n\"This is a bad idea, but I gotta do it.\" I muttered to myself. \n\n\"What is, John?\" My hand was on the lock, and I turned the key. Seka stared at me with glazed eyes. \n\n\"I'm sorry, Seka. For Jacob, for whatever Jones turned you into. But it has to be this way. Make a run for it if you still have it in you.\" The door flung open, and the beast trotted out.\n\n\"What are you doing?! Have you lost your mind, John?\" Seka said. Her eyes widened as the Entity left it's prison, then began to back away.\n\n\"I'm saving my skin.\" I broke into a dash, and made my way to a guard tower. I climbed up the rungs of the ladder, and stared for a moment at the lookout's dazed expression as he trained his rifle on nothing at all. Then, I took it from him, and pushed him off the side, watching him fall. Down on the ground, the creature had began to gain strength, as it ate. It wasn't back to what it had been, but it would have to do. Soon though, sirens started up.\n\n\"WHITE-NIGHT! RED ALERT! WHITE-NIGHT! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! ALL GUARD-TOWERS, TURN ON YOUR SEARCHLIGHTS, FIRE AT WILL, FIRE TO KILL.\" Jones had woke up on the wrong side of the bed, and was madder than hell.\n\n I ducked down, and took a shot at one of the men in the guard towers, heard it ping off the metal. Shit.. On the ground, they had their hands full with the beast. It was weak, though. Almost too weak. \n\nThe rapid-fire staccato noise of an automatic rifle rang out, and I saw the Entity shriek, and shrink away from it. I trained my rifle on the shooter, fired, and watched the beast tear him apart. \n\nThen, I took a bullet in my goddamned ear. One of the men in the watchtower had seen me. Damn near blew my head off, I was lucky to be alive. I collapsed to the floor of watchtower, and laid prone, heart pounding. I hoped the guard thought me dead. As soon as he turned, I took my own shot at him. I took cover as soon as I saw the splash of red. Two down, two to go.\n\n\"DON'T YOU FOLKS UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON?! THEY'RE COMING TO TORTURE US ALL! THEY'LL KILL ALL OF YOU, THE WOMEN, THE CHILDREN, THE MEN. YOU NEED TO FIGHT! WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS! THOSE WHO CAN'T FIGHT, LAY DOWN YOUR LIVES! IT'S BETTER THAN LETTING THEM TAKE IT FROM US!\" Shouted Jones' loudspeaker.\n\nThen, a response came from what must have been a bullhorn. Outside the walls, it rang out.\n\n\"I told you we'd come back. Drifter, Jones, come out, and the others get to live. You have my word.\" The words echoed. \n\n\"WHAT GOOD IS THE WORD OF A DEGENERATE PIECE OF GARBAGE LIKE YOUR KIND?! YOUR WORD IS WORTHLESS! MY WORDS ARE THAT OF A GOD!\" Jones had whipped himself up into a megalomaniacal, drug-induced rage. It was not unusual for him.\n\n\"Sure, Padre. So be it. Gentlemen, break down the doors.\" the voice from the bullhorn shouted. I trained my rifle towards the mass of vampires. They held torches, knives, the younger looking ones held onto guns. Some of them held ancient looking firearms, muskets, I think. They hadn't put their glamours on, no attempts at mind-gaming a pretty face onto themselves.\n\n\"THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO SURRENDER! YOU'RE OUTNUMBERED, AND OUTCLASSED! EACH MEMBER OF MY TRAINED CADRES ARE WORTH TEN OF YOU GHOULISH IMPERIALISTS!\" Jones shouted back. Real soon, this was going to turn into a blood bath.\n\n\"What in the fuck are you talking about? Imperialism? We're here for blood.\" The vampire shouted over his bullhorn, confusion evident in his voice.\n\n\"THAT'S WHAT IMPERIALISM IS! IT HAS NEVER LED TO ANYTHING BUT BLOOD.\" Always rhetoric with Jones.\n\n\"Put the drifter on the intercom.\" The voice exasperatingly asked. Why, I wondered.\n\n\"IF I SAW THAT SON OF A BITCH, I'D SHOOT HIM DEAD.\" Jones shouted. I didn't doubt it.\n\n\"Put him on or we'll burn you out, Waco-style.\" They replied. Shit.\n\n\"JOHNNY! GET TO THE RADIO ROOM, OR YOU WILL BE SHOT.\"\n\n\"Fine, asshole.\" I muttered to myself. I climbed down the tower, and watched as the others stood aside like clockwork men. The beast stalked from bunkhouse to bunkhouse, and I did not envy those it found.\n\nI made my way to the building, and entered. The bastard was in there, eyes bulged out to kingdom come, strung out on something strong.\n\n\"They want to talk to you, John. They want to talk to you, because you're a goddamned traitor to us all. So go ahead. Talk.\" He gestured with a pistol.\n\n\"Uh.. Hey..\" I said over the intercom.\n\n\"Is this the drifter? Listen, we're reasonable enough. We don't want a slaughter.\"\n\n\"You just want me and Jones... Is that right?\"\n\n\"It is. You can save all these people, by just walking out.\"\n\n\"I don't much like that idea.

I'm sorry, Jake.\" I fired a shot into his head, and stepped over the body. Outside, gunfire chattered, as the cultists fired into the air. Others began to line up for cups of punch.

Anything was better than this, and so I opened the door to see an ancient, grotesque vampire.\n\n\"We are not pleased. Would you come with us? Save the lives of those who can still come back from this madhouse. Give yourself up, and save them. Offer still stands.\" It was older than anything had a right to be. It's gaunt features were an exaggerated mockery of a face.\n\n\"What about Jones?\" I asked.\n\n\"What about me, you sons of bitches?!

How very droll.\" The Old One laughed.\n\n\"I can give you an aneurysm with nothing but a thought!\" Jones shouted, losing steam. His expression told me he was trying.\n\n\"Not even a headache. Tell me, what is it you thought would happen when we came here? Did you think that your faith in your own delusions would affect us? My men told me you were crazy, but I didn't figure you'd be so infantile, so moronic. I figure you're the one who put that drifter up to the murder of my people in Vegas?\"\n\n\"PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO RUSH-..\" Jones' words cut off abruptly as the Old One lifted him off the ground by his neck. I was glad he didn't answer the question.\n\n\"Shall I pop his head off? Such a silly little man. To gather all these people for a cause that led up to nothingness.\" The Old One spoke. \n\n\"What about me? I never wanted any part of this. I was just trying to survive. Just like you. You think I wanted to get wrapped up in any of this?!\" I stammered. He looked on, judging me.\n\n\"That is... unfortunate.

Give me a way out that doesn't end with my death.\"\n\n\"And this.. fellow.. with the hole in his head? Where does he play into it?\"\n\n\"Hates vampires. Was training his people to go to war against you. He got into my head, made me do what happened in Vegas.\" It was a shitty lie. But it was better than nothing.\n\n\"He did not train them particularly well, it seems. Much too out of his mind to be effective, if I do say so. You though, you've handled this situation rather wisely.\" It was almost as if he held some sort of respect towards me. I felt hope for the first time in a long while.\n\n\"What now?\"\n\n\"Well, I would ask you to ensure that your pet behaves. The one behind you. Please, do keep it in it's place, or we will put it down.\" He said. The Entity stood, watching. Why didn't it attack?\n\n\"Are you going to kill me?\" I asked.\n\n\"All this rotten meat, this plebeian gutter-trash, I don't feel quite hungry. We'll give you a two day's head start. We aren't all savages.\"\n\n\"Are you going to kill him?\"\n\n\"We'll deal with him in our own way. He's not a God, but he's immortal, yes. He can be crippled, though. He can be made to understand the errors of his ways. He will be punished. This man incited you to violence, insanity. He created a herd of people with rotten meat, and tainted blood. We'll be taking him with us.\" The Old One stated, in a matter of fact sort of tone.\n\n\"NO! MY PEOPLE, COME! COME NOW!\" The masses began to rush the gate.\n\n\"No.\" The Old One snapped his fingers, and those who were dead and walking fell to pieces, while those who were alive snapped out of it. Jones screamed in impotent fury.\n\n\"Seka?!\" I shouted. Then, I saw her. Alive, but sallow. Jones never remembered to make his puppets eat enough food, but she wasn't one of the dead-puppets.\n\n\"Sir, I suggest you leave her. Remember, you have two days before the hunt begins.\" Two days to run. I'd been doing that all my life. \n\n\"What's going to happen here when I leave?\"\n\n\"The survivors will not be harmed. The dead can be buried according to the customs of this society.\" He said, still holding Jones by the neck.\n\n\"What about the cops?\"\n\n\"We're all around you. More of us than you'd think. More than you'd ever guess.\"\n\n\"What about my people?\"\n\n\"Look at the survivors. Those are your people, the ones you saved. This man would have fought to the last man, woman, and child to save himself. You were very brave. I admire that.

YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT A WEEK.\" Jones screamed.\n\n\"Settle down, or I will have to remove your tongue.\" The Old One said without a hint of emotion.\n\n\"Well, uh.. Sir.. Thank you for the head start, and, uh, I really hope I never see you again.\" I stammered.\n\n\"For your sake, I should hope so.\" He said.\n\nI broke into a sprint, started running, and kept on going until the sun rose.
