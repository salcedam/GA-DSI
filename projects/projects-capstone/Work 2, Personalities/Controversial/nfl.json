Bridgewater isn't allowed to play to his strengths in a play-action run heavy offense like we have to run with AP.  That means lots of deep drops and lots of 3rd and longs while facing a ton of pressure.  \n\nThe Vikings best offense was in two minute drills and passing situations where they spread things out and put McKinnon next to Bridgewater in the shotgun.  \n\nAPs numbers last year were all from big yards.  He was 26th in the league in success rate and successful runs and lead the league in negative runs.  He broke a few.  But he also consistently put the Vikings offense behind the chains and in tough situations.  \n\nThe same tug and pull that was happening with Bradford that you've seen and the same success that the Vikings offense has had when they decide to go pass first and open things up is the same success the Vikings had last year and the same struggles they had to consistently sustain have good drives was there last year with AP. \n\nAnd further, the best Teddy has probably looked in his career was 2 years ago when AP was hurt and Teddy got to play in that format.  \n\nBridgewater averaged 234 yards per game 13 TDs and 6 interceptions over the final 9 games of that season once he got settled in--without AP.  \n\nOver a full season thats 3800 on 67% (166-247) yards 35 TDs and 11 INT in much more up tempo offense without AP designed towards Bridgewaters strenghts not AP's.  Bridgewater isn't the typical Norv Turner big armed air coryell QB that he normally looks for--Bradford is closer to that that is true.  \n\nBridgewater is a really good QB.  We'll see how good he becomes especially now with the injury but akin to Russel Wilson in his first couple of seasons there's going to be a lot of people that question his numbers and call him a game manager, but if you watch him on a consistent basis you will start to pick up on the things that makes him really good. \n\nI hated Ponder and was willing to criticize him.  I would want him out if he was bad.  Bridgewater tied the franchise record for wins through the amount of starts he has made for the franchise.  \n\nI'm not sure why people who only see a game or two of him and highlights try so hard to beat Bridgewater down.

That's an average of 2.56 20+ yard passing plays per game. \n\nThe Vikings offense averages more TDs per game, more FGs per game, and hits more 20+ yard passing plays per game with Bridgewater at QB than Bradford.  \n\nThat doesn't mean Bradford is bad, you've watched him...so I have I, he's playing pretty well.

Mike Wallace was cut by the Vikings because he was not a good player for them.  \n\nYes we are using sample sizes.  The question is would the Vikings be 3 and 0.  The answer to that question is yes most likely.  \n\nBridgewater is one of the better intermediate 15-30 range passers and one of the most accurate in the league.  Go and watch tape and don't just listen to what people tell you.  The immediate way to spot someone who has no clue what they are talking about is saying that Bridgewater can't throw more than and only throws less than 10 yards.  It's just not a conclusion backed up by reality.  Criticizing his 40+ yard accuracy is fair, but there's a lot more to that.  \n\nBut people are saying Bradford is playing well.  He has been.  But the Vikings aren't built to win with guys with huge numbers.  The Panthers had more passing yards and more running yards than the Vikings, but the Vikings won very easily and were the much better team.  \n\nBradford and Bridgewater are different QBs and do have different strengths.

It's not a European/US thing (baseball doesn't, basketball has a soft cap).\n\nThe main issue from a European standpoint is because it's played cross-border and across multiple leagues, it would be very hard to implement, as you say. It's not even labour laws, per se, but that someone, somewhere (generally a very rich Arab) will happily spend all his money pursuing fame through team ownership, meaning that if the EPL implemented a salary cap (and they can, theoretically, and it's worth noting that FFP is effectively a kind of 'soft cap'), then all the owners would decamp to Belgium (or wherever), which would lead to all the players leaving. Whereas, in the NFL, if you don't play there, then you're not really playing anywhere (meaningful).\n\nIn terms of the draft, the key issue in Europe is that player development under the age of 21 isn't done within higher education, but rather directly by clubs (which brings up it's own separate issues). Again, given the pool of players globally, you couldn't have a draft for Messi, who'd been at Barca since the age of 12(ish). It dissuades teams from developing players by giving them nothing in return (this is a common theme amongst European and lower league British teams, around developing players and then getting ripped off by the bigger clubs).\n\nInterestingly, his point of revenue-sharing *is* actually in play in the EPL, and is one of the big reasons why people claim it's the most competitive (and therefore exciting) in Europe (whilst simultaneously now hurting EPL clubs in the latter stages of major European trophies). Nowadays, the team in 10th place in the Premiership has more buying power than all but about 10 clubs across the rest of Europe.\n\nYou could never have fully guaranteed contracts under a hard cap, unfortunately, simply because if you were paying Andrew Luck $25m a year for the next 6 years and he basically spent the next three years injured, you'd lose any sense of being able to be competitive (unless some kind of injury exemption was brought in, which brings it's own issues with \"oh yes, he's injured\" when a player is no longer effect on the team he's on).

If you look at points per drive, we go down from 3rd to 8th.\n\n2. Our defense is 2nd in starting field position. A lot easier to give up yards w/o giving up pts when you have a lot more yards you can give up.\n\n3. It doesn't show how bad our defense is at setting up our offense. We don't get turnovers which lead to easy points and force short drives which lead to good field position. No offense is going to score a TD every time they have the ball, a defense that can set up the offense is extremely valuable.\n\n4.

Their offense lives and dies by the run just like the Panthers last year. As good as Dak has been for a rookie he's nowhere near the level Cam was playing at last year.

Newton barely face pressure all season and the only two games he did they loss. It's similar to Prescott, he's struggled when he has been pressured.\n\nWith a guy like Brady or Brees, even when they're getting pressured, they just release the ball in 1.5 seconds and make plays. Prescott (and Newton last year) just don't have that ability.\n\nStopping the run is a key part of this because the run takes pressure off your pass protection and ultimately your QB.

You bring up his passer rating last year conveniently ignore context such as how the Panther's receivers lead the league in drops and how their passing offense utilized a lot more low completion % plays instead of a more efficient short passing system the Cowboys use.\n\nSaying he's \"top 5 under pressure\" this year means absolutely nothing, especially if you don't bring up stats to back it up. He could be getting blitzed and finding the open man and taking advantage of that, while getting slaughtered when four man rushes get home.

For instance, first-and-goal from the 10-yard line in a tie game at the start of the second quarter has a clutch index of almost exactly 1.0. A more clutch situation, one late in the game when the game is close -- the same situation as above but midway through the fourth quarter, for example -- has a clutch index of about 2.0.

The major problem here, and the objection you're going to hear over and over again is the non-public nature of the formula.\n\nWhy is that a problem?  Every stat has problems, without exceptions.  For most, I can look at what's going on and figure out why in this case that stat isn't telling the story I would expect it to.\n\nA perfect example:  a team with the #1 offense *and* the #1 defense is probably a team you're very worried about meeting in the post-season.  And for this particular example, you wouldn't have to worry, because they didn't make the playoffs.  I'm referring to the 2010 Chargers, whose woes are largely attributed to some spectacularly bad special teams play.\n\nMy point being that you can look at what happened and see why a team that was statistically dominant didn't even make the playoffs.

Teammates rely upon each other and, as the clich\u00e9 goes, a team might not be the sum of its parts. By dividing credit, we are forcing the parts to sum up to the team, understanding the limitations but knowing that it is the best way statistically for the rating.  On a pass play, for instance, there are a few basic components: the pass protection, the throw, the catch, the run after the catch .... whatever credit we give to the blockers, receivers and quarterback in these situations is designed to sum to the team expected points added .... quarterbacks receive some portion of credit for the result of the play, including defensive pass interference, intentional grounding, scrambles, sacks, fumbles, fumble recoveries (Carson Palmer once recovered a teammate's fumble that saved the game for the Bengals) and throwaways.\"\n\n> Do they have someone grade each play like pff does?\n\nYes, they have people who chart each play.  From ESPN's FAQ question \"Is it subjective?\":\n\n\"The part of QBR that could be cynically called \"subjective\" is that there are judgment calls with regard to what are dropped passes vs overthrows or underthrows or defended passes. ESPN's video trackers have strict guidelines on how to chart these items so that they are consistent across the different people doing charting. If you as a fan go out and chart these yourself for a game or two, you will see how several calls are easy, but some are quite hard to judge. We have standards that make things more uniform and every game is done twice to reconcile inconsistencies. Despite the standards, the gray areas will still exist and, because they exist, the division of credit quantitative analysis described below is important. That analysis is what says that a \"drop\" isn't necessarily all about a receiver because there are gray areas in drops .... our hope is that any statistics used to evaluate individuals in football come with analysis to help split the credit in these more gray areas. We did that analysis to limit subjectivity.\"\n\n> I always thought it was an algorithm that they plugged numbers into including rushing stats and fumbles meant to give a better view of a qb's whole game and not just their passing stats.\n\nAgain, from the FAQ:\n\n\"Will it ever be calculable with a calculator?

They also don't seem to have any baseline requirements to qualify so you could go out and go 3/3 for 45 yards and a td on the final drive of the game and have a higher qbr than someone who went 30/31 for 350 yards and 3 tds.

For instance, first-and-goal from the 10-yard line in a tie game at the start of the second quarter has a clutch index of almost exactly 1.0. A more clutch situation, one late in the game when the game is close -- the same situation as above but midway through the fourth quarter, for example -- has a clutch index of about 2.0. Maximum clutch indices are about 3.0, and minimum indices are about 0.3.*\n\nhttp://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6833215/explaining-statistics-total-quarterback-rating\n\n*\"That's been changed.

The major problem here, and the objection you're going to hear over and over again is the non-public nature of the formula.\n\nWhy is that a problem?  Every stat has problems, without exceptions.  For most, I can look at what's going on and figure out why in this case that stat isn't telling the story I would expect it to.\n\nA perfect example:  a team with the #1 offense *and* the #1 defense is probably a team you're very worried about meeting in the post-season.  And for this particular example, you wouldn't have to worry, because they didn't make the playoffs.  I'm referring to the 2010 Chargers, whose woes are largely attributed to some spectacularly bad special teams play.\n\nMy point being that you can look at what happened and see why a team that was statistically dominant didn't even make the playoffs.

I found [this](http://www.patspulpit.com/2014/2/26/5451184/in-defense-of-the-afc-east) to be a good review.\n\nThe below numbers are taken from 2014, I don't have the time now to update, but I doubt they've changed significantly.\n\nSince 2001, the Patriots are 65-18 (.783) against AFC East opponents. The Jets have a .464 percentage in the division while the Dolphins have a .429 and the Bills have a .341 percentage. When one compares the Patriots .783 winning percentage against division teams to that of the rest of the league against the AFC East (excluding the Patriots) over that time frame, there is dramatic difference. The rest of the NFL has a .533 winning percentage against the Jets, Dolphins, Bills and Colts (2001 only for the Colts) with a 223-195 record against the rest of the division. The Patriots have a .746 percentage (103-35) against non-AFC East team since 2001.\n\nPeople will bash the AFC East because the Patriots always win, and the Jets, Bills and Dolphins fail to win a wild card spot. But they forget that the Jets, Bills and Dolphins aren't bottom of the barrel teams like you find in many other divisions. All three of them are usually around 8-8, give or take two wins. Now obviously that's not always good enough to make the playoffs, but it's not bad enough to be beaten up by your average NFL team.\n\n**TLDR:** The Patriots don't rack up wins from playing in an inferior conference, they rack up wins against everybody because they've been the best team in football for the past 15+ years.", "id": "d71kdnm"}, {"comment": "I think the problem for the Jets/Bills/Dolphins is just the AFC in general.

Soccer's cards are based on how reckless of a challenge the player made, not the result. The result is just something that often helps the ref understand how poor the challenge was because they can't be everywhere at once to see every challenge at every angle.\n\nI'd think something similar would actually work pretty well here, as well.

Since the single ref sometimes misses things they are occasionally the same in effect, yes, but they are just as often not.

First of all because there are several refs instead of just one, and second of all because instant replay is already accepted and could be used for this kind of thing, as it is in college with targeting (not that that's a perfect implementation of this idea or anything).", "id": "cyu92uz"}, {"comment": "The endless call for flags and fines and suspensions for Shazier's hit is entirely due to the result.

But the result makes them see red and makes the pressure to fine and suspend Shazier very great and likely to happen.\n\nIt is not something that is implemented, it is something that happens naturally as the result of rules being written in a certain way - ie with tons of subjective criteria allowed.  Soccer rules are very much written that way, and everything is exacerbated by how little the one ref can possibly see.

Like in college I think the targeting rule is usually applied without regard to result. I've seen plenty of players thrown out when no injury or even no hint of an injury occurred. The refs have some fairly clear criteria, and they apply it uniformly to the best of their abilities (some things will always be missed).\n\nThat said, trust me, I know how public perception affects the NFL's actions (see flair). I would love to see a card-type system in the NFL, but with the current way the league is being run I do agree that there is a high likelihood that we'd see it applied inconsistently due to public perception.

Runners do this more often than defenders, by far, but I suspect with the defenders being the \"bad guys\" it would mostly be called against them.\n\ni think refs need something between the 15 yard personal foul penalty and ejection as a tool.

And by struggles, I mean he came close to beating the Packers, Cardinals, Panthers, and Bengals, and Rams. But the Seahawks lost those games and the offense didn't look pretty along the way. While it felt like nothing was clicking, the biggest culprit of those struggles was the offensive line. Wilson was getting absolutely destroyed every dropback, and the line couldn't even establish the run very effectively. The Seahawks were dead last in pass pro, and in every game we looked like what we just made the Vikings line look like on Sunday.

I did a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3ovoxy/is_russell_wilson_underrated/) back in October putting forth an argument that I only half-believed, that Russell Wilson should be viewed as a top 5 QB. In that post I pointed to his high career Y/A of 7.9. Since then his career Y/A has moved up to 8.1, and he has the 4th best career Y/A of all time (tied with Rodgers and all of the guys ahead of them played before 1960 in a drastically different era).\n\nAt the moment if you're talking about who the top 5 QBs are, I think you're sorting Brady, Dalton, Palmer, Wilson, Rodgers, Brees and Newton into a top 7.

He's doesn't appear in any way malicious. \n\n\n- Cam looked checked out 2nd quarter on. He had no sense of urgency all day, his body language sucked and he looked like someone who was exhausted due to stress. This is what McNabb looked like in his SB. It was weird then and it's weird now. I dated a girl who suffered panic attacks. After attacks she would be exhausted emtionally and her brain would be fried. That's what it looked like. \n\n\n- I'm super shocked how bad his emotionally/mental game appeared. This guy has a lot of experiences. He's was kicked out of a college. Paid his dues playing JUCO. Played in huge games in college while being the focal point of \"he's everything wrong with the game\" criticism and Scam Newton taunts. He won huge games including a National Title. \n\n\n- While watching the game I kept thinking that one of his veteran teammates need to go over and try to joke around with Cam. Try to get him to relax and enjoy the moment. In a lot of high pressure spots your better served with levity then intensity. \n\n\n- I agree with the majority that too much was made of Cam on the sideline with a towel over his head BUT I disagree that situation should be entirely dismissed. It's not a good look for a leader. Cam has some issues with stress and professional maturity. Didn't like when he fell on the ground (watching the D) late in the 4th quarter. Didn't like that he was sitting on the bench when they were about to get the ball back with a min to go. Can't understand why he didn't jump on the ball down 6 in the 4th?! What The Fuck?! You're still right in that game. \n\n\n- Is Cam a front runner? Randy Moss is one of my favorite all time players. Watched him for years. He sucked at dealing with stress and adversity. There were times he would check out mentally. Cam appeared to do the same last night. \n\n\n- Cam Newton is 26. He's still a young man. If he reflects in the right ways this can all be a learning experience about his own weaknesses. We try to paint people as certain things. The problem is paint drys but people evolve.

Give the guy a podium or if he's needs to be seated put a table in from of him. Having your whole body exposed seated on a dais is a super uncomfortable position.

He had no sense of urgency all day, his body language sucked and he looked like someone who was exhausted due to stress. This is what McNabb looked like in his SB. It was weird then and it's weird now. I dated a girl who suffered panic attacks. After attacks she would be exhausted emtionally and her brain would be fried. That's what it looked like. \n\n\n- I'm super shocked how bad his emotionally/mental game appeared. This guy has a lot of experiences. He's was kicked out of a college. Paid his dues playing JUCO. Played in huge games in college while being the focal point of \"he's everything wrong with the game\" criticism and Scam Newton taunts. He won huge games including a National Title. \n\n\n- While watching the game I kept thinking that one of his veteran teammates need to go over and try to joke around with Cam. Try to get him to relax and enjoy the moment. In a lot of high pressure spots your better served with levity then intensity. \n\n\n- I agree with the majority that too much was made of Cam on the sideline with a towel over his head BUT I disagree that situation should be entirely dismissed. It's not a good look for a leader. Cam has some issues with stress and professional maturity. Didn't like when he fell on the ground (watching the D) late in the 4th quarter. Didn't like that he was sitting on the bench when they were about to get the ball back with a min to go. Can't understand why he didn't jump on the ball down 6 in the 4th?! What The Fuck?! You're still right in that game. \n\n\n- Is Cam a front runner? Randy Moss is one of my favorite all time players. Watched him for years. He sucked at dealing with stress and adversity. There were times he would check out mentally. Cam appeared to do the same last night. \n\n\n- Cam Newton is 26. He's still a young man. If he reflects in the right ways this can all be a learning experience about his own weaknesses. We try to paint people as certain things. The problem is paint drys but people evolve. Imo his guy is too good and dynamic to stay down. \n\n\n- This whole story line is gonna get old quick and it's not going away. Brace yourself's NFL fans. Questions about Cam articles are coming.

Leads these guys in TD passes, 2nd best passer rating, and has double the passing yardage that Brady has right now. It's hard to close a volume gap when guys like Ryan are going to be 4500-5000+ yard passers.\n- Drew Brees is attempting 44 passes per game. And he's playing really well. He just won't win because his team isn't going anywhere IMO.\n- Matt Stafford is doing well, but his team is also probably not going anywhere unless major changes occur to the roster (namely, everyone hurt gets healthy tomorrow). Not to mention, Stafford is only averaging 269 yards per game - super low compared to the guys above him.\n- Derek Carr is playing well, and his team is doing well.

Home field advantage would be practically non existent. \n\nI'm a Senators can in the NHL, and let me tell you from my experience: very few established fans are going to make the switch to the local team. Whenever the Sens have a home game against the Habs or the Leafs, the rink is overrun with their fans. It sucks. It would be the same thing between the Toronto team and the Bills. \n\nI dunno.

Belichick had a good statement on how Butler's strong desire to tackle makes him (and others) excel at it.\n\nQ: How would you evaluate Malcolm Butler\u2019s tackling ability?\n\n> BB: Well, I think one of the biggest things is just the desire to tackle. I think I\u2019ve coached a lot of defensive backs and Malcolm will go in this category of when a guy catches a pass on you they really want to tackle him and tackle him hard. And I think you see that. There\u2019s a certain type of defensive back I think that has that mentality. If they catch one then \u2018I\u2019m really going to try and tackle a guy as hard as I can because he caught one on me,\u2019 type of thing. I think you see a lot of Malcolm\u2019s tackles like that. Tackling receivers is different than tackling running backs. That\u2019s a challenge for any defensive back really because of the skill those players have running the ball and usually they can face up the defender. But you know, Jonathan Jones is kind of like that, too. He\u2019s not the biggest guy but kind of like Malcolm he\u2019s tough and wants to tackle and knows how to use his size and his quickness usually to tackle low but to be able to get those guys on the ground and wrap them up. I\u2019d say a lot of it is desire, some of it is technique, and then there\u2019s definitely an element of playing strength that comes in there. But desire\u2019s probably number one.

If the Pats pulled the Broncos in the playoffs, they would get knocked out. More often than not, we played the Colts and were knocked out by Manning immediately. The Broncos OWNED the Pats from 2001-2009. NOW, the rivalry is because Manning vs. Brady. In the 2000's, the rivalry was real. The Broncos and Pats have been the class of the AFC for 15 years (with the Pats obviously holding the edge).

I don't know anyone who really thought of it as one in new england and the only reason the broncos are a rival right now is because the path to the super bowl has to go through the broncos at some point -whether it's played in new england or Denver - and that's because of what manning has brought to the team.\n\nThat's like saying we have a rival with the titans because they can't win in new england.

Cord cutting took away from me watching trash like PTI and ATH and I couldn't be happier. \n\nMy reasoning is simple and maybe a bit hot-takey: They've tried to make the game safer and in the process they've neutered it - and I'm not even talking about the explosive hits we were used to seeing all the time. \n\nFirst, there are barely any kickoffs so the KR is now basically a thing of the past. KRs are one of the most exciting plays in all of sports but now you're lucky if your guy gets back to the 20. The music city miracle would've never happened and Devin Hester would've never had a career.\n\nSecond - and for my money is the more sad of the 2 - is that the running game is now a thing of the past because they wanted to make the game more vertical and safer for DLs. You take away the chop/crack back/cut blocks and you've basically taken away an offenses ability to get guys down to the ground. \n\nLastly and most obviously, they've taken away part of the fun by penalizing being happy. It's like the Mayor of the town from Footloose took over the NFL and made enjoying yourself illegal. People don't watch football so that it mirrors their shitty ass job. Players can't smoke weed but you'll dope them up on painkillers and PED them give them a NFL-sponsored sixpack to wash it down with so he can forget the fact that he punched his wife in the head for making dinner too salty and is suffering from chronic CTE. "], [4, "Probably. The sport has been in a decline for almost 10 years. The league made a decision to make simple things complicated and dumb down the other parts of the sport. What's a catch ? If you hit outside of a QB's strike zone it's 15 yard. The league has made it an offense first league and has made it very difficult for DBs to do their job. In a league where flags are thrown for sneezing the wrong way , specific teams and players are still given pass after pass because the league wants to see them be successful. The league never would have tolerated Brady, Manning, or Brees getting tossed around like Cam was week 1. I'm not going to turn this into a circle jerk but you see it week in and week out with specific teams. Look at how the league handled the ray rice situation before and after the video got leaked the public. Bottom line is that the NFL has always been a business and it making calculated moves that are good for business. It's just a lot more transparent than normal and the public can see that. \n\n\nTake all that and toss in players gaining more knowledge on the toll the game takes on their bodies and you have more early retirements than ever before and more kids either not playing or not being allowed the play. The game is not going anywhere , people will always watch and continue to play. But the sport's best days are probably behind us unless they find a way to simplify the game again and calm the injury /concussion epidemic.

So it is very likely the majority of the ratings drop can simply be attributed to cord cutters. TV as a medium is simply dying off faster than NFL and Cable execs had anticipated. \n\nBut there is something to be said about over saturation of primetime games. Monday Night Football used to be something special because it was unique, now we're beat over the head with meaningless nationally broadcast games trying to be passed off by the league as exciting and relevant. \n\n\nThe NFL is long overdue for moving their entire broadcasting schedule 100% online.

In fact, I watch like 7 more games a week because of it. Cord cutting took away from me watching trash like PTI and ATH and I couldn't be happier. \n\nMy reasoning is simple and maybe a bit hot-takey: They've tried to make the game safer and in the process they've neutered it - and I'm not even talking about the explosive hits we were used to seeing all the time. \n\nFirst, there are barely any kickoffs so the KR is now basically a thing of the past. KRs are one of the most exciting plays in all of sports but now you're lucky if your guy gets back to the 20. The music city miracle would've never happened and Devin Hester would've never had a career.\n\nSecond - and for my money is the more sad of the 2 - is that the running game is now a thing of the past because they wanted to make the game more vertical and safer for DLs. You take away the chop/crack back/cut blocks and you've basically taken away an offenses ability to get guys down to the ground. \n\nLastly and most obviously, they've taken away part of the fun by penalizing being happy. It's like the Mayor of the town from Footloose took over the NFL and made enjoying yourself illegal. People don't watch football so that it mirrors their shitty ass job. Players can't smoke weed but you'll dope them up on painkillers and PED them give them a NFL-sponsored sixpack to wash it down with so he can forget the fact that he punched his wife in the head for making dinner too salty and is suffering from chronic CTE.

The league made a decision to make simple things complicated and dumb down the other parts of the sport. What's a catch ? If you hit outside of a QB's strike zone it's 15 yard. The league has made it an offense first league and has made it very difficult for DBs to do their job. In a league where flags are thrown for sneezing the wrong way , specific teams and players are still given pass after pass because the league wants to see them be successful. The league never would have tolerated Brady, Manning, or Brees getting tossed around like Cam was week 1. I'm not going to turn this into a circle jerk but you see it week in and week out with specific teams. Look at how the league handled the ray rice situation before and after the video got leaked the public. Bottom line is that the NFL has always been a business and it making calculated moves that are good for business. It's just a lot more transparent than normal and the public can see that. \n\n\nTake all that and toss in players gaining more knowledge on the toll the game takes on their bodies and you have more early retirements than ever before and more kids either not playing or not being allowed the play. The game is not going anywhere , people will always watch and continue to play.

Neither one are good enough to be the long term solution qb the 49ers, the standard is high. They're moving on if they like Goff or Wentz, AS A TRUE PASSER. If not, Gabbert cannot beat Kap out in real competition, no way. I dont know who is \"smarter\" than the other, but Gabbert certainly doesn't play \"smarter\" than Kap.  If Kap was accurate down field people would think he was a genius. He rarely does anything dumb, thats actually a real strength of his game, doesn't take dumb hits,  is careful with the ball, ect... Usually plays a very smart game. He was trained by an excellent coach.", "id": "d0uki0r"}], [{"comment": "So far the only qb to have the \"skill set\"  that thrives under chip has been nick foles.

The CB successfully stays over the top and the LB drops back to cover underneath.\n\nThe QB moves to his second progression, the TE running the seem.  In this case it the Safety makes a mistake and moves to cover the crossing WR instead of covering the TE over the top.  The LB is no match for his height and the QB those an easy TD.\n\nHis third read, which he never makes it to, is the WR (actually an RB that lines up as a WR on the play) running the swirl at the top of the video.  The WR running the crossing route draws defenders to the middle, isolating the CB on the outside.  If the Safety had covered the TE properly, the RB on the swirl route would have been open anyway (though whether he gets a TD is questionable).\n\nHad the 2nd LB floated to the outside to cover the swirl, the crossing route (4th read) would have been open across the middle.  He definitely doesn't score, only gets 5-7 yards. \n\n---------\n\nSo if Kaep has trouble going through progressions and reading defenses, he's not a fit in Chip's system.

I know most times those reports are bullshit but it seemed to be true for at least part of but not all of the locker room.  As coach/person with GM responsibilities you can't have that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo me if you really followed and watched the Eagles all year you could see the lack of commitment out there on the field.  Why did Murray have a killer game the last time he'd get a chance to play Dallas, yet struggle due to \"scheme fit\" all year?  Why did we win the one game everyone had us guaranteed to lose after a speech not from our head coach, but from our owner begging our players not to embarrass him in front of his hometown?  I think the team was very talented last year and Chip Kelly had an inability to bring all the guys together.  He was a hands off, my way or the highway, I'm not your pal boss.  That doesn't fly in the city of brotherly love, with a hands on players' owner like Lurie, filled with the remnants of an Andy Reid roster that was all about comradery and being a family.  If you're wondering why it took three years to show up I'd point to the notion that winning hides problems and that I think the problem intensified as Chip stepped into more power last offseason.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm not a well known person or a frequent commentor but I supported Chip until the end.  I was crushed when we fired him.  With that in mind though I can't ignore all that has came out since his departure.

It does seem to be the \u201cbest\u201d measure of quarterback play, although whether the tradeoff in accuracy for transparency is worth it remains up to each individual reader. One of the drawbacks I see in Total QBR is the failure to incorporate strength of schedule. And while no other traditional passer metric does, either, it\u2019s also easy enough to make those adjustments. Hopefully, an SOS-adjusted Total QBR measure will be released soon (I\u2019ll note that the college football version does include a strength-of-schedule adjustment).  My sense is that Total QBR is underutilized because (1) ESPN haters hate it because it\u2019s an ESPN statistic, (2) it\u2019s proprietary, and (3) analytics types disliked it because of the (now-eliminated) clutch rating.

Not sure intention matters that much. Which is worse, malice, or ignorance? Start stomping into a pile, and you're probably going to step on someone. Whether he meant to stomp Blount specifically or not doesn't change the fact that he shouldn't have been doing it in the first place.\n\nI'm making one assumption, based on several facts and pieces of evidence.

Or are you justifying Burfict because of Blount's actions? Does that mean Burfict is open season for dirty plays and hits? You won't mind if guys start diving for his knees?\n\nSo, I've been taking your word on this eye poke thing and finally decided to look it up for myself. First off, [it's not even clearly an eye poke/gouge](https://vine.co/v/5HtQ3L2DHVa). Williams has a damn visor on. He clearly gets his hand under the face mask and pushes him by the face, but eye gouge? Impossible to actually tell for sure. Still, not acceptable behavior either way. And second,[ it definitely isn't unprovoked.](https://vine.co/v/5HxaiE5wIIZ) Williams just got done tackling Blount on the play and pretty clearly kept trying to drive Blount into the ground after they were both down, then unnecessarily used Blount to push himself up. I honestly don't mind the play, and I'm not saying it justifies Blount's response, because it doesn't. But the fact remains, Blount's action was not \"unprovoked.\"\n\nSo you're whole, 'Blount was going after players unprovoked earlier in the game' argument kinda goes out the window here.\n\nAnd even if he had, it doesn't change the fact that we can clearly see the stomping motion. It doesn't change the fact that we have two separate players reacting to the stomp. Blount didn't just get up and push a guy, he jumped up, clearly upset, and pushed a guy that just got done clearly stomping into the pile. And we clearly see Brady reacting to that stomp. Too many coincidences to be coincidence for me. I don't buy that Blount jumped up from scoring a TD and randomly decided to shove Burfict rather than celebrate the score. That makes no sense. You can argue intention all you want, and we'll never know for sure, but the only explanation that makes any sense is that Burfict did in fact stomp on him.\n\nBut I'm a nut, so what do I know?\n\n", "id": "d8yfzgy"}, {"comment": "Honestly, I think everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt.

Whether he reaches that or not who knows, but he has the ceiling. Also, we will know in 2 years whether he is a franchise QB, unlike the 3-4 years for a rookie QB. Also, he is still 26 if I am correct, so he still has a few years to develop and grow into a better QB. Also, he had 4 years to develop, not 3, and he doesn't have much to show for it because he played behind one of the GOAT QBs, who set the season passing record AND career passing record during Brock's four years. I don't think anyone can blame him for not playing much. And that QB is notorious for not giving his backups game reps. Which was clear at times during garbage time. Then this season when he finally played, he went 5-2 I think, and played at an average level for a QB. Even while being in Kubiak's offense, which is not fit to his strengths of having a big arm, and being a big pocket QB, it plays more into run, run, PA rollout. PA rollouts are fit for quick guys good at throwing on the run. That is not Brock. Also, O'Brien has consistently given his QBs the best season of their careers/winning games with poor QBs, and making them look halfway decent. Beat the colts in Indy with Brandon Weedon, Bengals with TJ Yates, Case Keenum's first two career wins after just being on the Rams' practice squad earlier the week before, Hoyer and Firz's statistically strong/average seasons with us, Ryan Mallett showing extreme potential, Hackenberg in college his freshman year, getting Matt McGloin signed in UDFA, Patriots and some of Tom's best years with the TE Party. Brock seems to have very high upside, and BOB should continue getting more out of Brock than his former coach. So he has a pretty high ceiling just from that. If we \"waste\" two years on him, we likely will be in a better position to trade up to 1st-2nd overall to get a truly elite QB prospect, unlike this year, where we were picking at 22nd as well.\n\nSorry my thoughts were everywhere on this, I wrote this over the course of a few hours while walking around Boston, hahaha", "id": "d4rhzzp"}, {"comment": "Matt McGloin was an UDFA", "id": "d4rk9rr"}, {"comment": "Thank you.

", "id": "cz8e7iw"}, {"comment": "[This should help explain it](http://grantland.com/features/how-terminology-erhardt-perkins-system-helped-maintain-dominance-tom-brady-patriots/). Key thing to takeaway is that there are essentially three main offensive \u201csystems\u201d in the NFL: West Coast, Coryell, and Erhardt-Perkins. Given that every NFL team runs basically the same plays, each of these NFL offensive families is differentiated mostly by how those plays are communicated.\n\nBrady has played entirely under a Erhardt-Perkins system. However, there has been a bunch of turnover at positions around him, so the manner of attack has varied significantly.\n\nEarlier on in his career, Brady benefited from a physical running game and some dependable receivers. Then it was quick screens. Then we added Wes Welker and Randy Moss and ran more of a pass-happy shotgun spread offense. When we added Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez, the offense became a two\u2013tight end\u2013based attack. With the development of Edelman it has now shifted again to quick routes with Gronk finding seams against the defense and a focus towards YAC. We've had a few others mixed in there, especially on a game-by-game basis (running against the Colts for example), but you get the idea.\n\nWith the help of his assistants, Belichick\u2019s primary innovation was to go from an Erhardt-Perkins **offense** to an Erhardt-Perkins **system**, built on its method of organizing and naming plays. The offense itself would be philosophically neutral. This is how, using the terminology and framework of what was once thought to be the league\u2019s least progressive offensive system, Brady and Belichick built one of the most consistently dynamic and explosive offenses in NFL history. From conservative to spread to blistering no-huddle, the tactics \u2014 and players \u2014 have changed while the underlying approach has not.\n\nSo it sounds like you guys are just talking about different things. An offensive system is often meant in laymen's terms to be the offensive style of attack, a run-heavy offense like the Vikings, the Pistol in Denver under Kubiak or Chip Kelly's up-tempo spread option. In this regard, Brady has gone through a bunch of different offenses with the ability to completely change the offense as needed for each game depending on what skills the Patriots have and what weaknesses their opponents have. This makes them very game-plan specific, each game they have their own offensive philosophy. But for the Patriots, it's all built on the same underlying communication system.

We don't know what White is but all signs point to him being a 1K yard receiver but Tate and Jones should also be a great duo. As an MSU fan, I was a big fan of Langford but Abdullah offers more in the talent department and should show more if we can improve the O-Line. Plus, we have a great pass catching back in Riddick where the Bears lost their best backfield receiver in Forte. Ebron has a small edge over Bennet and had a better 2015.\n\nYour turn!", "id": "d11zaqf"}, {"comment": "1) No arguing with that, its facts but I think it's much different now compared to the last three years.\n\n2). I don't think there's a big difference between Cutler and Stafford. It could go either way with who's better, they are that similar it's tough to say who's better. I wouldn't say there's a clear advantage for any team with QB's, obviously Stafford is younger so there's that.\n\n3) I agree that Levy will add a new dimension to the Lions defense and it should be much improved but I believe Trevathan/Freeman/Hicks will add to what was already an average defense lacking talent. I have no idea what our defense will be like, though, but I'm sure Fangio can do some special things.\n\n4) I know Kevin White hasn't played a down but I think a healthy White and Alshon Jeffery is much better than Golden Tate and Marvin Jones - don't forget Eddie Royal in the slot where he is best at, at times this season he was forced to play as our #1 receiver. Abdullah needs to work on his fumbling, I think Langford is the better all around back to be honest but its tough to say since I've only seen about 5 games of Ameer. Bennett will probably be traded for a 5th round pick I'm guessing leaving Zach Miller as our #1 TE, but he played very well in the 2nd half of last season and if he can continue that we've got a very good receiving corps. I can't comment on Ebron because I haven't seen much but he is a first round pick so he must have some big potential, it isn't usual for a TE to be drafted that high and the ones who have (Eifert) have become very good; I didn't think it was a good decision when it first happened and I still don't but who knows?", "id": "d1208yo"}, {"comment": "I'd ask you to take a look at Stafford's second half after Lombardi got canned.

He also lacks elite top speed but he's much shiftier than Langford and can create something out of nothing more often than not. I'd give us the nod in the RB corps but will yield that White & Jeffery make up the better WR duo until we see what Jones is capable of.\n\nThe Bears Defense is what I'm more worried about this year after the additions and Fangio did a lot with a weak roster last year. However, both Slay and Ansah are only going to get better. We'll have to wait and see on that one. \n\nWe took Ebron way too high but he doubled up his production from 2014.

But there are significant differences.\n\n> Brady was in his second season, having had nearly 18 months to digest the playbook. His offensive coordinator at the time, Charlie Weis, has said that Brady knew the offense as well as Bledsoe by the conclusion of that preseason. It\u2019s been reported that head coach Bill Belichick almost named Brady the starter at that point, before the injury Bledsoe suffered in Week 2 vs. the Jets. If Romo was healthy, there was zero competition, zero debate. Heck, Prescott wasn\u2019t even the backup until Kellen Moore went down at training camp.\n\n> The Cowboys have done a masterful job of limiting the chances Prescott is taking downfield. They aren\u2019t running the entire playbook either, as the Patriots were doing with Brady, who threw 16 touchdown passes and seven interceptions in the nine games before Bledsoe was deemed ready to return and Belichick decided to stick with Brady. Also, the Pats were 6-3 in those games with Brady. In Bledsoe\u2019s previous 26 starts, New England was 7-19.\n\n> That\u2019s also not the case with Romo. The Cowboys are 15-3 in his last 18 regular-season starts. Again, 18-3. It\u2019s hard to bench a guy who has won 86 percent of his starts the last few years.\nAgain, this should all be the greatest news possible for Cowboys fans. Sing, dance and be merry.

But there are significant differences.\n\n> Brady was in his second season, having had nearly 18 months to digest the playbook. His offensive coordinator at the time, Charlie Weis, has said that Brady knew the offense as well as Bledsoe by the conclusion of that preseason. It\u2019s been reported that head coach Bill Belichick almost named Brady the starter at that point, before the injury Bledsoe suffered in Week 2 vs. the Jets. If Romo was healthy, there was zero competition, zero debate. Heck, Prescott wasn\u2019t even the backup until Kellen Moore went down at training camp.\n\n> The Cowboys have done a masterful job of limiting the chances Prescott is taking downfield. They aren\u2019t running the entire playbook either, as the Patriots were doing with Brady, who threw 16 touchdown passes and seven interceptions in the nine games before Bledsoe was deemed ready to return and Belichick decided to stick with Brady. Also, the Pats were 6-3 in those games with Brady. In Bledsoe\u2019s previous 26 starts, New England was 7-19.\n\n> That\u2019s also not the case with Romo. The Cowboys are 15-3 in his last 18 regular-season starts. Again, 18-3. It\u2019s hard to bench a guy who has won 86 percent of his starts the last few years.\nAgain, this should all be the greatest news possible for Cowboys fans. Sing, dance and be merry.

On the flip side, it's also why we never talk about say, a defensive tackle's win-loss record. \n  \nThere are plenty of examples of non-QBs who won multiple rings to go along with a few all pro nods over their careers yet who are not in the Hall of Fame. There is exactly one example of a QB who has won multiple rings and isn't in the Hall of Fame and that's because he spent the rest of his career playing extremely average, was a backup more often than a full time starter, and accrued literally no other accolades.   \n  \nI've said it elsewhere (if you want to actually have a discussion rather than dismiss anything you don't agree with as me just trying to make up a narrative, at least take two seconds to look over the rest of the thread), TD's rings aren't irrelevant, but it's also an important bit of context to acknowledge that those Denver teams were extremely talented top to bottom and it's extremely likely he wouldn't have any rings if the team wasn't built as well as it was.  \n  \nAgain, it's not ideal, but it's fact. If TD was a quarterback who came into the league playing well, won 3 AP1s, a league MVP, and back to back super bowls while also hitting an exclusive plateau (say, 5k yards or whatever) he would absolutely be in the hall of fame already, and it's because wins and rings are weighed far more heavily when discussing QBs than any other position.", "id": "d9ynlrd"}, {"comment": "Opinion definition \"a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge\".

One of the most important parts of any job is showing up.\n\nAndrew Luck had the best single year, but Wilson had his best year last year and is showing growth as well.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/QnGbv\n\nWilson's YPA is high and his completion percentage is high despite playing with an OL that struggles year in and year out and his turnovers are considerably less than Luck despite playing more games. The most common argument is \"Luck is asked to throw more\" but what is Wilson SUPPOSED to do? He had a 68% completion percentage last year with a high YPA and low turnovers along with his typical 500 yards rushing. All while losing multiple key pieces on offense. If you're asking me \"hMJem, if Wilson were a Colt, do you think they're a playoff team year in and year out?\" Yes I do. If you're asking me after \"Are the Seahawks a playoff contender with Luck?\" I'd say yes, but I also think his turnovers would still be a problem and potentially even cost Seattle it's only Super Bowl win. Wilson didn't have a great game vs the 49ers in the NFC CG, but I could totally envision Luck coughing up the ball too many times in that game that Seattle barely got by and it be a loss in this alternate universe.\n\n\"But, the run game!\" As if Wilson isn't apart of it? Every single player the Seahawks run (unless someone just has a godly read or mess up) he commands extra attention which helps the RB's. Tom Cable said it best, Marshawn Lynch is important to Wilson's success but Wilson is just as important to Lynch's success.\n\nNot saying Luck won't be a God like people say he will be. But I see no reason that it's infathomable to say \"Hey, Wilson can keep getting better too, and maybe he'll have a better career than Andrew Luck\" Wilson had a bad OL, Lynch was hurt all year, then Rawls got hurt, Graham got hurt, and he still had a great year.\n\nToday, Wilson has been the better NFL QB since both were drafted.

I think the only plus side is that the defenses would have to adjust and game plan to a brand new format. The reason why we play with one quarterback is because we look at that QB as the general.

One, if you're a defensive coordinator, you easily see a pass incoming if you have 2 quarterbacks on the field. That makes planning against that offense that much easier. Then, having a 2nd qb means you have one less skill player (either a wide receiver, tight end, or half back) to block or catch the ball. It makes calling the defensive plays that much easier.\n\nIts benefit comes from the players on the field being tricked, which can be an issue. However, if you have 2 linebackers spy the quarterbacks, and 7 people in coverage, you only have to rush two linemen to start the play. After its apparent the QBs aren't going to run, you can use the linebackers to rush.

I'm sure some really good ones could do it (I think TB could for instance) but most need a bit to establish that tempo and momentum.\n\nIt sounds like hogwash but it's really not.

I don't care if Suh did it or Aaron Rodgers or OBJ did it. You can't do that in the NFL. I'm not into conspiracy theories about it being for ratings for SNF or because fantasy football/gambling, although I'm sure it was a factor. I have completely lost the direction in which the league is headed. There are so many contradictions regarding suspensions it's just not fair to keep changing the rules every week on a player to player basis in such an arbitrary way. If any, and I mean literally any other player had done what Beckham did, he'd be suspended. I am enjoying the NFL less and less every week. I used to watch as much football as possible, I'm already down to just watching Packers games. But I am starting to feel bad about myself when I watch the game because this isn't fun anymore.

Yes, he deserves to be in over Megatron.\n\nAndre Reed. Retired 4th in yards, 3rd in receptions, 6th in TDs. 7 Pro Bowls, 3 All Pros. No Rings, but he did play in 4 consecutive Super Bowls. Yes, he deserves to be in over Megatron.\n\nJohn Stallworth. Retired 13th in yards, 15th in receptions, 17th in TDs. 3 Pro Bowls, 1 All Pro. Similar to Irvin and Monk, Stallworth is the proud owner of 4 Super Bowl Rings. Yes, he deserves to be in over Megatron.\n\nLynn Swann.

But I wouldn't lose sleep over it."], [18, "**TL;DR - It doesn't make economic sense to rig games; therefore, it's a good bet that games are not being rigged.**\n\nI've had this conversation a number of times, and I'm pretty certain that rigging doesn't happen in any highly profitable sport (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL) because it doesn't make long term economic sense.  If you're familiar with game theory, a repeated game is what applies here.  And, while rigging is good in the short term, it is highly risky for the long term.\n\nSo, the prevailing argument for rigging goes that a league will rig games in order to promote popular teams in good markets because it is better for ratings and thereby better for the bottom line.  There is absolutely merit to this thinking.  But, the gains for rigging any one game are relatively small.  If we look at the worst Wild Card of this weekend (KC vs HOU), they averaged 25.1M viewers.  The best (GB vs WAS) had 38.8M viewers.  That's ~50% more ad revenue, but it only lasts one game (provided, of course, you don't rig the next one as well).\n\nHowever, the problem with this analysis is that it ignores the consequences of getting caught.  If the NFL  were caught rigging games, it would dramatically damage the reputation of their product, and for a lot more than just one game (likely years).  In fact, fan disillusionment would be bad enough that it would seriously diminish the popularity of the sport, especially among the fanbases that felt their team had gotten screwed.  It's safe to say that the lost revenue from damage to the brand would *far* exceed any small gains that were made along the way by rigging a few games.  Plus, there could be lawsuits because people bet on the outcome of these games.\n\n\"But, they'll never get caught, you may say.\"  In this day and age, the NSA couldn't even keep Edward Snowden from getting the word out about surveillance.  Sadly, more people care about football than their privacy so you can bet it would be *even easier* to get the word out on rigging.  \n\nAll it takes is for one guy who was in on it to spill the beans.  He could do it *years* later too, and it would still be extremely impactful.  Things change a lot over time, relationships sour and a lot of money could be made selling the story about how the NFL rigged games.\n\nIf you're running a league that is already extremely popular and profitable, it's just not worth the risk to rig games.  Uncovering a rigging scandal is one of the few things that could seriously undermine the massive popularity of the league.  The leagues that are most likely to rig games are the ones that *aren't* popular and desperately need to manufacture buzz; they don't have much to lose if they're caught."], [8, "It's all corrupt"], [5, ">Is it possible that NFL games are rigged?\n\nI'd be surprised to see things rigged in the stereotypical \"pay off the refs\" kind of way, at least not on a consistent basis.

If they really were saying it was for safety purposes but it was really because they wanted to have 2 more regular season games and the money that goes with it, then by the definition, they were acting dishonestly for personal gain.\n\nWhen teams tank to get a better draft pick, that influences games.

This is stupid, unnecessary and would never happen. In reality you only need a few specific calls in any game to go a certain way. It's all about the context of a call. Say we're using basketball as an example. Team A is benefitting from ref help and is down 3 points with 30 seconds to go. Team B makes a brilliant defensive play and steals the ball and they have a 2 on 1 heading down for an easy basket. The ref blows the whistle and calls a bogus hand check foul giving Team A 2 free throws and almost assuredly taking 2 points off the board for Team B. Team A draws within 1 point on a 4 point swing with no more time going off the clock and is now one play away from winning. One bad call, across 48 minutes of basketball, changes it from a 5 point game into a 1 point game. And if fans or outspoken owners complain about the call the league just says it was a judgment call and the ref believed he saw enough to make the call. Even if it gets reviewed later and they admit it was a bad call (like the NFL has started doing) it doesn't change the outcome of the game which is all that matters. \n\nThe comparison to the NSA just doesn't work for two reasons. One is that the NBA is a sport while the NSA is a government organization that affects the way people live their lives. A whistle blower for the NSA is going to feel a moral conviction to tell people about it, regardless of the money they can make from becoming a celebrity. A whistle blower for the NBA isn't telling people about some important event that changes their life, he's informing them that a sport they watch for entertainment isn't as fair as they think. Pretty different stakes, considering the NBA can still ruin his life using their considerable financial resources. The second difference is that the NBA can easily pin it all on a scapegoat while the best the NSA could do would be to blame a director for overstepping his bounds. The NBA fires the scapegoat and deals with maybe a few years of increased scrutiny. The NSA has to reorganize their command structure and deal with thousands of people analyzing their every move and dragging it into the light along with an aggressive oversight committee. \n\nAs for the cost-benefit portion of your argument, it's really quite simple. The potential cost of getting caught making a few bad calls, turning a referee into a scapegoat and dealing with a few years of scrutiny where they just let things play out normally vs turning a young, exciting player into a superstar who will sell millions of jerseys and tickets during his career.

In fact, it's entirely irrelevant to the economics and my point whether it takes one call to rig a game or 20.\n\nThere are only three things that are relevant:\n\n1. What is the benefit of rigging games\n\n2. What is the cost of getting caught\n\n3. What are the chances of getting caught.\n\nThe NSA comparison is to prove that the chances of #3 are not 0.  If Snowden can pull off whistleblowing on the most secretive and well financed organization in the world, then someone on the inside of an NBA rigging scandal can sure as hell whistleblow; they wouldn't have to leave the country or sacrifice their entire life to do it either.  In fact, if they did it right, they'd make a boat load of money.\n\nI also find it amusing that you (someone who believes the series was rigged without any concrete evidence) seem to think it would be incredibly easy for the NBA to just turn a whistleblower into a scape goat.  If there was a whistleblower that actually lent credibility to game fixing, people like you would be raising holy hell.  It wouldn't even matter if 80% of NBA fans bought the leagues story.  If they lost 20% of their market, that would be a *huge* blow.\n\nAs far as your last paragraph goes, if you really believe that the NBA stands to profit more from rigging a game than getting caught fixing games, then there's not much I'm going to be able to say to convince you otherwise.  I'd recommend a sports economics class, because you clearly don't have any understanding of the concept.\n\nJust looking at that specific series, the NBA had Dirk Nowitski on the other side - a white [super star](http://i.imgur.com/nPmpCsx.png) who has strong appeal in a major target growth market (Europe).

He could do it years later too, and it would still be extremely impactful. Things change a lot over time, relationships sour and a lot of money could be made selling the story about how the NFL rigged games.\n\nThe NSA is light years ahead of the NBA in sophistication as far as preventing leaks goes, and they couldn't even manage to prevent it.  They tried making Edward Snowden a scape goat too, and it didn't work.\n\nEven if the chance of a leak is only 0.5%, it is not worth the risk from the leagues' standpoint.  The gains from rigging are simply *too* small compared to the massive losses incurred if they're caught.\n\n> Mark Cuban was really unpopular amongst refs, mostly bc he was so outspoken against bad calls and unfair reffing.

Pace has tried to trade Cutler in the past, according to reports.\n\nYou don't see a point in holding on to Cutler, and I don't see a point on letting him go right now (unless a team wants to trade for him, which I think we'd pull the trigger if we were actually getting offers).  I 100% agree we should've drafted a replacement the past few years but that hasn't happened, so at this particular moment we might as well keep him.

Also Lynch was practically non-existent last year (Injury+Performance Drop). Wilson went to a historic level in the later half of the year when we did not have any running game and lost our TE (Lynch, Rawls and Jimmy Graham were out with injury).\n\nThe reason I think your doubts about Wilson having Top3 potential is crazy is because you can make a legitimate argument that he is currently Top5 already. QBs better than him are Brady, Brees, Rodgers and Ben. For the fifth spot you could make the argument for Wilson over Cam and Luck based on their overall career performance. Cam had a better year and was MVP but Wilson has had a better career so far. So with Brady and Brees at the twilight of their career, I can easily see Wilson being in the Top3.

You're right in a sense; he could be the #5. But there are far more QB competing for that #5 spot than you listed. It could be Cam,Luck,Rivers, Palmer, Romo maybe even Dalton, ElI, Ryan. Sure, he could be #5. There is an even smaller change he will be top 3 (pretty much all the guys I listed could have a career season and be in the top 3, for the most part). \n\nI guess my point isn't him being a #3 next season. It's if he projects to be an elite talent like Brady, Rodgers, (old) Peyton, and Brees over the course of his career. Wilson has played really well in a really good system. I am unsure this qualifies him for Rodgers or Manning greatness though. Overall, I think Luck has a better chance of becoming a QB legend (or close). \n\nWith me saying all that, I do really like Wilson and believe he's an incredibly QB. Who knows? Maybe I'm wrong.

[O-Line Ranking](https://www.profootballfocus.com/pro-ranking-all-32-offensive-lines-this-season/) You can check out the PFF ranking to get an idea, Colts are at 15 compared to Seahawks at 30.\n\nSome of the QBs you have listed are nowhere close to being in discussion for a 5th spot. Dalton, Ryan and Eli are average franchise QB (I will grant you the two super bowl runs by Eli though). Dalton and Ryan have done nothing of note in the post season. Rivers, Palmer and Romo are good QBs but do not have much playoff success nor are there stats like passer rating as good as Wilsons.  \n\n\nAlso most of the QBs like Palmer, Romo, Eli etc. are around 36 so most of them are going to fall off in the next couple of years while Wilson would be in his prime, I can definitely see him as a top 3 QB in 3 years with so many QBs reaching the end of their career.\n\nWilson has the 2nd highest career passer rating of 101.8 next to only Rodgers. Last season he had the highest passer rating among all QBs at 110. The only slight against Wilson would be volume stats compared to some QBs who throw way more (more to do with the Seahawks play style). If you look at stats like TD-Interception ratio, passer rating, Comp% etc. he would compare favorably against all the QBs you listed.\n\nJust to reiterate, I have no issue with your thought being that Luck has a better chance of being a QB legend and if you think he is better than Wilson.

Between them, there is one QB who steps up his play when facing the tougher teams in the later rounds or later in the game when the pressure is on. I'm not trying to say stats are the end all, be all discussion point, but stats don't lie. And from your perspective, they certainly seem to carry considerable weight. And keep in mind I haven't included this post season in this analysis, but that would only further add to my argument as Manning played much worse than Brady, and Brady once again elevated his play when it mattered the most.\n\nWhen trailing late in the Playoffs, [Peyton](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/play_finder.cgi?request=1&match=summary_all&search=&player_id=MannPe00&year_min=1998&year_max=2015&team_id=&opp_id=&game_type=P&playoff_round=&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&week_num_min=0&week_num_max=99&quarter=4&quarter=5&tr_gtlt=lt&minutes=15&seconds=00&down=0&down=1&down=2&down=3&down=4&yds_to_go_min=&yds_to_go_max=&yg_gtlt=gt&yards=&is_first_down=-1&field_pos_min_field=team&field_pos_min=&field_pos_max_field=team&field_pos_max=&end_field_pos_min_field=team&end_field_pos_min=&end_field_pos_max_field=team&end_field_pos_max=&type=PASS&is_complete=-1&is_turnover=-1&turnover_type=interception&turnover_type=fumble&is_scoring=-1&score_type=touchdown&score_type=field_goal&score_type=safety&is_sack=-1&include_kneels=-1&no_play=0&game_day_of_week=&game_location=&game_result=&margin_min=-40&margin_max=0&order_by=yards&rush_direction=LE&rush_direction=LT&rush_direction=LG&rush_direction=M&rush_direction=RG&rush_direction=RT&rush_direction=RE&pass_location=SL&pass_location=SM&pass_location=SR&pass_location=DL&pass_location=DM&pass_location=DR) drops to a poor, 55% completion, 4TD/5INT ratio and a 71 Passer rating.

It also gets at the larger issue of what is clutch. To me it's maintaining, or preferably elevating, ones performance during key moments like when you're trailing late in a playoff game. \n\nIf you look at it from an overall playoff game by playoff game performance, [Brady has a standard deviation of 23.5 and Manning's is 32.1](http://i.imgur.com/FVohxoG.png?1) (standard deviation is basically a measure of how spread out a bunch of numbers are). This indicates that Manning is less consistent than Brady: his average might be basically the same, but his highs are higher and his lows are lower. Here's another way to look at their consistency via the distribution of passer ratings:\n\nQB|<50|50-75|75-100|100-125|125+\n:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\nBrady (# of games)|1|7|11|7|3\nBrady (%)|3.4%|24.1%|37.9%|24.1%|10.3%\nManning (# of games)|3|4|11|3|3\nManning (%)|12.5%|16.7%|45.8%|12.5%|12.5%\n\n\nAdditionally, if we look at the types of playoff games Manning has played in, we can further see how \"unclutch\" he is. Brady has played 15 of 29 games (51.7%) in AFCC's and Super Bowls in contrast to Peyton's 7 of 24 games (29.2%). So he regularly plays against the top teams in the league. Peyton has also played over twice as many wild card games (7 vs. 3). Manning gets a clear bump in the stats from playing in more Wild Card games against poorer competition.\nTheir passer ratings splits for each round of the playoffs are:\n\nQB|Wild Card|Division|Conf. Champ.|Super Bowl\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\nBrady|84.1|93.1|80.0\t|95.3\nManning|102.0|84.0|86.9|81.0\n\n\nAlso, in regards to post-season 4th-quarter comebacks and game-winning drives, Brady has 6 4QC's and 9 GWD's (4 in Superbowls).

Last year, he faced the most pressure in the league and his WR1 didn't crack PFF's top 100 WRs.  Despite that, Bridgewater's fundamentals--decisionmaking, vision, footwork, accuracy--are all excellent.  Common criticisms of Bridgewater--e.g. that his deep ball is bad, or that he should be doing better with Adrian Peterson--are either inaccurate or misunderstood.\n\n***The Supporting cast***\n\n**Pass Blocking**\n\nTeddy Bridgewater was the most-pressured QB in the NFL last year, [facing pressure on 46.7% of his dropbacks](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/684423859706183680).  For comparison, that's just slightly more pressure than [Tom Brady](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2016/01/25/pro-ne-den-grades/) and [Cam Newton](https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/696561175543336960) faced against the Denver Broncos' defense in the AFC Championship and Super Bowl, and significantly more than the NFL average of about 30%.  While [Bridgewater may perform better than others when pressured](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/684423859706183680), every quarterback performs better with a clean pocket.\n\n**Playcalling**\n\nYet not all of that pressure lies entirely on the pass blocking, which [PFF still ranked as the 16th-best pass blocking unit in the league](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2016/01/20/pro-ranking-all-32-offensive-lines-this-season/).  Another large part of the problem was the offensive playcalling, which [led the league in deep dropbacks](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/673871678464765952).  This resulted in plays like [this](https://gfycat.com/BonyFarAmericanredsquirrel), where a play-action seven-step dropback with max protect results in Bridgewater being sacked as soon as he finishes his dropback.\n\n**Receivers**\n\nCompounding these issues is the Vikings' lack of receiver talent.  Mike Wallace was brought in in 2015 to be the Vikings #1 wide receiver; he finished the season with [100 wide receivers ranked above him](https://twitter.com/pff/status/676861065829990404).  Think about that for a moment: the Vikings' WR1 graded lower than most teams' WR3 or WR4.  The leading receiver on the team in yards and touchdowns, Stefon Diggs, only started nine games all season.\n\nSo when evaluating the Vikings' passing offense, or looking up passer rating or touchdowns to compare quarterbacks, remember that you're not just comparing quarterback play, but the play of other ten players in the passing offense, too.  Very few people would claim Andy Dalton is a superior quarterback to Aaron Rodgers, but Andy Dalton statistically outperformed Aaron Rodgers last year handily.  That's not so much because of Andy Dalton's superior quarterbacking last year so much as it is the Bengals having much better pass blocking and much better receivers last year.  \n\nSo it is with Teddy, who was the NFL's most pressured quarterback and who was throwing to one of the worst receiving corps in the league.\n\n***The Fundamentals***\n\n**Decisionmaking**\n\nAfter Bridgewater's 2014 rookie season, ESPN had this to say about Bridgewater's decisionmaking:\n\n> [Bridgewater also had a terrific season-long showing in the bad decision rate (BDR) metric that gauges how often a quarterback makes a mental error that leads to a turnover opportunity for the opposing team. **His 0.5 percent BDR is a Tom Brady-in-his-prime-caliber number.** The league-wide BDR average is usually about 2 percent (once every 50 passes) and the elite bar is 1 percent (once every 100 passes).](http://espn.go.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/13013677/why-vikings-make-playoffs-2015-nfl)\n\n2015 proved that this rookie performance was no fluke, Bridgewater again posted a low BDR, and PFF noted that [Bridgewater had the third-lowest percentage of negatively-graded throws in the league](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2016/01/07/pro-pffs-2015-nfl-quarterback-rankings/).\n\nSo Bridgewater has consistently demonstrated an ability to avoid mental mistakes.\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nTeddy Bridgewater was the most accurate quarterback in the NFL last season, with an [accuracy percentage of 79.3%](https://twitter.com/pff/status/690200681127481344) (accuracy percentage meaning percentage of throws that are catchable, ignoring drops, spikes and throwaways). \n\nPart of that is due to his low-ish average depth of target (Bridgewater's 7.2 yards per attempt in 2015 is tied for 11th of 20).  Yet [ProFootballFocus notes](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2016/01/21/pro-crazy-stats-from-the-2015-nfl-season/):\n\n> While this number is inflated by the large amount of short throws required by the Minnesota offense, it is no small feat to be the most accurate in the league. In fact, Teddy scored his best passing grades on throws between 10\u201319 yards, and broke even on throws over 20 yards.\n\n> You have to wonder if Bridgewater\u2019s modest touchdown and yardage totals are more a product of the Vikings\u2019 offensive style, rather than an indictment of the QB\u2019s abilities.\n\n**Footwork and pocket presence**\n\nBridgewater's footwork and pocket presence is consistently excellent, providing Bridgewater with accuracy and power.  Bridgewater also exhibits great awareness of where the pass rush is coming from, and a Brady-esque ability to step up into the pocket to evade pressure.\n\nHere are just a few examples:\n\n* Bridgewater takes a [seven-step play-action dropback](https://gfycat.com/FragrantAdoredCrocodileskink), facing pressure at the top of his drop.  He steps up into the pocket and quickly finds Kyle Rudolph, throwing an intermediate touch pass outside the numbers for a touchdown.\n* [Here is another example](http://www.gfycat.com/HappyWeeklyBengaltiger) of Bridgewater stepping up in the pocket to evade pressure and throw a deep touchdown pass.\n* [Here again](http://gfycat.com/DecentGiganticCoot) Bridgewater steps up in the pocket to evade edge pressure and delivers a bullet deep to Stefon Diggs.\n\nYou get the idea--Bridgewater regularly displays great awareness of where the pressure is coming from, and that pocket presence and footwork allows him to manipulate the pocket to buy time.\n\nBridgewater is also very elusive:\n\n* [Here Bridgewater evades two pass rushers](http://www.gfycat.com/GlossyWatchfulBorer) to roll out of the pocket and complete an intermediate pass.\n* [Here Bridgewater](http://gfycat.com/FlawlessFamousBonobo) eludes some pass rushers in a broken pocket to run for first down.\n* [Here Bridgewater](http://www.gfycat.com/AthleticAllGrison) eludes two pass rushers to avoid a sack.\n\nWhat these gifs don't show is just *how consistent* Bridgewater is in his footwork, his dropbacks, his manipulating the pocket to evade pressure, his abilty to elude the pass rush.  That consistency is what makes Bridgewater's technique in the pocket so good.\n\n**Vision**\n\nTo me, the biggest difference between the NFL's elite quarterbacks and draft busts is their vision.  Some quarterbacks have a tendency to lock on to their first receivers or abandon their progressions when the pocket breaks down.  This is something Bridgewater really excels in:\n\n* On [this play](https://gfycat.com/GreenHeartyCanary), Bridgewater quickly cycles through about a dozen reads before someone gets open.\n* Throughout the Vikings @Broncos game, Bridgewater was facing immediate pressure, yet he [kept his eyes downfield](http://www.gfycat.com/DecentGiganticCoot) even while being hit."], [20, "[removed]"], [16, "Staaaaaaahp, he's not elite but he's not trash.

They said there was a pay for performance pool, which paid for interceptions, fumbles, and yes, big hits - but players didnt get paid if a hit was illegal or flagged. Goodell also never produced any solid evidence to back up injuries - just circumstantial evidence and evidence backing up the pay for performance pool.\n\n> Roger Goodell claimed the Saints had a system from 2009-2011 where they would pay to specifically injure other players. He claimed to have several thousand pages of evidence of this, but refused to show it to anyone. Instead, he said what some of the evidence was, and the media went to town taking his word for it.\n\n> The coaches and players never admitted to any bounties - only to a pay for performance program, where you would get bonuses for interceptions, fumbles, big hits, etc.\n\n> But by then, public opinion was easily swayed by the media showing one hit on Kurt Warner, a few hits on Favre, and playing one audio tape by Gregg Williams, over and over and over and over, while still not asking to actually see any of the other evidence Goodell had.\n\n> To further advance the farce Goodell brought in a \"special investigator\" Mary Jo White, who claimed they had received a signed confession from a player, so the case was basically open and shut.\n\n> But then the NFLPA leaked the \"confession\" and it wasnt a confession.\n\n> Goodell said he had the bounty ledger, full of pages of a history of payments for \"cart offs\" and other injuries. Except when they released a page that had \"cart off\" payments on it, it was for a game where no one had been injured. The NFL quickly revised their statement saying it was actually for a different game.... that also didnt have any injuries in it.\n\n> The NFL then said they had a powerpoint presentation from Gregg Williams to the defense that specifically references bounty payments. Except the NFLPA leaked that one too, and it was a ridiculous Dog the Bounty Hunter themed presentation that was just creating metaphors for their gameplan to the popular-at-the-time TV Show.\n\n> Those are just a few examples. Basically, any time Goodell said he had evidence, and it got leaked, that \"evidence\" didnt say what Goodell said it did.\n\n> And yet no one in the media really cared about all the inconsistencies. They kept writing their articles about how shameful all this was. Getting on their soapboxes. Pete Prisco, in 2011, had said the Falcons shouldve injured Drew Brees to keep him from breaking the passing record against them. But then he became the biggest critic of \"Bountygate\".\n\n> The whole thing was a giant media shit storm created by Goodell, because the league needed a scapegoat to look like they were \"tough on player safety\" ahead of the retired players concussion lawsuit. And it apparently worked, because the league got off BIG TIME with the relatively small settlement the judge awarded.\n\n> Basically, Gregg Williams is an over-exaggerating asshole who uses harsh language to fire up his team. But to this day there is no solid evidence of any payments for actual injuries. The details of the pay for performance plan even specifically pointed out that players didnt get paid a bonus for any illegal hits. And from 2009-2011, the Saints were near the bottom of the league in personal fouls and opposing team injuries.\n\n> Now, pay for performance was certainly illegal in terms of violating the salary cap. But the media firestorm and outrage wasnt over the salary cap violations - it was over the injuries. Which were never proven. We had several players suspended for a year, Coach Payton suspended for the year, our GM Mickey Loomis suspended for 8 games, and ou assistant coach Joe Vitt suspended for 4 games. We also lost two 2nd Round draft picks, and were fined $500k.\n\n> Paul Tagliabue was later brought in and voided the player suspensions. Goodell also said that if the Saints cooperated, and helped the league start several safety initiatives in high schools, we would get our 2013 2nd Round pick back. Benson never spoke out against Goodell, and was entirely cooperative with anything he wanted. We never got our 2nd Round pick back.\n\n> Many people will claim there is proof of a $10k bounty on Favre from Vilma, or that it wasnt from Vilma, but actually from Mike Orenstein (who was in jail at the time and couldnt have actually sent anyone anything). There's never been any proof of these things - these all come from just one source, Mike Cerullo, who had actually been fired from the Saints for several reasons and had to be escorted from the facility by the police.

It's not great; it's not bad.  Again, ProFootballFocus noted that Bridgewater's grading on deep balls [broke even](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2016/01/21/pro-crazy-stats-from-the-2015-nfl-season/).  That corresponds with the [Deep Ball Project's findings](https://brickwallblitz.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/deep-ball-project-faq/), which gave Bridgewater a \"B\" grade based on his deep ball tape and noted that his deep ball accuracy was 52.6% (ranking 12th of 33 overall).\n\nNevertheless, it's true that Bridgewater could stand to improve his accuracy on deep balls.\n\n* See [here](https://gfycat.com/WarySpiffyGannet),\n* [here](http://www.gfycat.com/OddballSilverCattle), or\n* [here](https://gfycat.com/OilyPartialGraywolf).\n\nThat said, it's not as if Bridgewater incapable of throwing the ball very deep:\n\n* See [here](http://gfycat.com/AssuredParchedBonobo),\n* [here](https://gfycat.com/OptimalValidAlleycat), or\n* [here](https://gfycat.com/BothFlashyKakarikis).\n\nAnd while Bridgewater does not have a cannon for an arm, he is plenty capable of throwing balls with zip:\n\n* See [here](http://gfycat.com/PastTepidInchworm),\n* [here](http://www.gfycat.com/UnrealisticCraftyChrysalis), or\n* [here](https://gfycat.com/GroundedDefensiveGourami).\n\nAnd in fact, Bridgewater actually [led the league in completion percentage on deep passes outside the numbers](https://twitter.com/PFF_Mike/status/719580887344627712):\n\n* See [here](http://gfycat.com/CalmGregariousBlackandtancoonhound),\n* [here](http://www.gfycat.com/RemorsefulCharmingCoqui),\n* or [here](http://gfycat.com/EnviousPoliteAztecant).\n\nIf I am belaboring the point, it is only because I hear this criticism all the time, yet I never see it substantiated.  The tape, ProFootballFocus and the Deep Ball Project all rate Bridgewater's deep ball as middle-of-the-road at worst.\n\n**Bridgewater should be doing better with a hall-of-fame talent like Adrian Peterson**\n\nAdrian Peterson is among the league's best pure rushers, yes, and prior to the snap, that may clear up space in the secondary.  To that extent, Peterson can only help Bridgewater.\n\nWhat is often overlooked, however, is just how much of a liability Peterson is after the snap on passing plays.  Adrian Peterson was the *lowest-graded running back in the NFL* on passing plays, according to PFF.  He was also heavily in the red (bottom five) in pass blocking.  Notice again on this play how [Peterson fails to block, running into his own linemen, simultaneously breaking the pocket while failing to get open as a hot read](https://gfycat.com/BonyFarAmericanredsquirrel).\n\n----\n\nOverall, he's an accurate quarterback with solid fundamentals and great decisionmaking.  I don't think he's elite or anything; I'd rank him around top 15 like PFF or QBR or a couple tape analysts do.

Another large part of the problem was the offensive playcalling, which led the league in deep dropbacks. This resulted in plays like this, where a play-action seven-step dropback with max protect results in Bridgewater being sacked as soon as he finishes his dropback.\n\nHow is calling a mass protect, and still getting sacked part of play calling? I get that it's not necessarily Teddy's fault, but it seems like their bases should have been covered with mass protect?\n\nEdit: Look, I am not trying to tear down Teddy here, in fact most of my posts are trying to explain why the plays were called as they were called. What I am trying to do is play a little bit of a devil's advocate to a post which was clearly written to prove that Teddy is a great QB. I mean Christ, reading this thing you might think that he is a Top 5 QB. \n\nIt's also about interpretation. I mean looking at [this gif](https://gfycat.com/GreenHeartyCanary) that was posted where it says \"Teddy made a dozen quick  reads and then hit the open man?\" I see a QB who is frantically looking for an open receiver, probably doesn't make a single solid read because he spends no time on each one, and then throws the ball after the play breaks down and a receiver just out runs the back. He shouldn't be making a dozen reads. I also see a QB who doesn't like to throw the ball into tight spaces. Which can be great for things like BDR, but means he is more likely to get hurried/sack because he is less likely to get rid of the ball. Which, if you have a relatively poor offensive line, can be a real pain in the ass for coaches. \n\nIn fact, they probably gave him so many 7 step drops because they wanted the play to develop fully before he made his throw. He can make all of his reads, and then hopefully someone will be open enough by then and Teddy can throw it. If the O line isn;t great, then you use mass protect. That's really your only option. Or you can run the ball a ton (which is what they do) but then don't blame the coach on having a run heavy offense.\n\nEnd of rant.", "id": "d5upaqp"}, {"comment": "Because they shouldn't have him doing 7 step drop backs if he keeps getting pressured/sacked", "id": "d5upjad"}, {"comment": "As one possibility, an OC could call a 3 step drop or a rollout or something else along those lines to try and disrupt the defense instead of sticking with a deep drop but adding extra blockers.", "id": "d5uq04y"}, {"comment": "Unless you think that your receivers need to get deeper into their routes before they will get open / before Teddy is timed to throw the ball.

Most coaches at that level are play calling and game planning for a reason. They know they team's assets/weaknesses better than anyone and usually play call to highlight the assets.

Our offense looks terrible because our drives on both offense *and* defense averaged the 4th longest in the league.\n\nI think deep drops and long developing pass plays probably play a role in that kind of ball-control offense as much as having a physical running game does.

The problem is this:\n\nNobody wants to sit through and spend a year watching a garbage 5-11 team especially when there were high preseason expectations pre Teddy injury. It's really hard on fans, players and management to sit through that and know you have to sit through that. It just sucks. If there is a quick easy way to avoid that, people will go for it even if it's not in their long term interest. \n\nBasically it boils down to this. You pick one of two options here. \n\n1) Take a look at the Vikings picks the past 15 years: \n\na) I think you could call 7/15 first rounders real hits (Kevin Williams Chad Greenway Sharrif Floyd Adrian Peterson Harrison Smith Teddy Bridgewater Anthony Barr). \n\nb) They've had 14 4th round picks. 4 you could say really hit for a 4th rounder(Everson Griffen Brian Robison Ray Edwards Brian Williams). That's a 28.5% chance basically. \n\n2) Now you compare that to having Bradford: \n\na) Bradford 3/6 seasons has missed 6+ games. If that happens this year Minnesota isn't giong anywhere. \n\nb) Last year was clearly the best year of his career where he was a middle of the pack starter. \n\nc) He is going to have to adjust to a new team on the fly with no offseason.\n\nd) Realistically the ceiling with Bradford is probably 10ish wins and no real shot at contending for an SB. And there are many things that have to go right(ie Sam's health) for that to happen. \n\nI would rather have the 50% of obtaining a dirt cheap star and 28% a dirt cheap solid starter vs MAYBE being able to pull out 10 wins for one season with no real shot an SB.\n\nBut again, fans and management dont think like this. They dont think long term, they think in the moment. and in the moment they were upset at having to think about going 5-11 and watching that product when day's before they had very high expectations with Teddy. It's just a big adjustment to have to make and watching shitty 5-11 football in the first year of a new stadium sucks.

It's really hard on fans, players and management to sit through that and know you have to sit through that. It just sucks. If there is a quick easy way to avoid that, people will go for it even if it's not in their long term interest. \n\nBasically it boils down to this. You pick one of two options here. \n\n1) Take a look at the Vikings picks the past 15 years: \n\na) I think you could call 7/15 first rounders real hits (Kevin Williams Chad Greenway Sharrif Floyd Adrian Peterson Harrison Smith Teddy Bridgewater Anthony Barr). \n\nb) They've had 14 4th round picks. 4 you could say really hit for a 4th rounder(Everson Griffen Brian Robison Ray Edwards Brian Williams). That's a 28.5% chance basically. \n\n2) Now you compare that to having Bradford: \n\na) Bradford 3/6 seasons has missed 6+ games. If that happens this year Minnesota isn't giong anywhere. \n\nb) Last year was clearly the best year of his career where he was a middle of the pack starter. \n\nc) He is going to have to adjust to a new team on the fly with no offseason.\n\nd) Realistically the ceiling with Bradford is probably 10ish wins and no real shot at contending for an SB. And there are many things that have to go right(ie Sam's health) for that to happen. \n\nI would rather have the 50% of obtaining a dirt cheap star and 28% a dirt cheap solid starter vs MAYBE being able to pull out 10 wins for one season with no real shot an SB.\n\nBut again, fans and management dont think like this. They dont think long term, they think in the moment. and in the moment they were upset at having to think about going 5-11 and watching that product when day's before they had very high expectations with Teddy.

You must have a driver not named Trevor Siemian or Mark Sanchez for that honor.\n\n> For analysis on every team, take a look below. And, as always, feel free to share your take: @HarrisonNFL is the place.\n\n\n\nRank | Team | Description\n----|----|-----------\n1 | [](/CAR) Panthers | Carolina has to be No. 1, although it's close with New England. The return of a healthy Kelvin Benjamin should prevent this offense from taking a step back in 2016. Even if the Panthers did catch lightning in a bottle with offensive coordinator Mike Shula's everything-I-call-is-working play calling last season, Benjamin adds another dimension to this team. The worry is the pass rush, though re-signing Charles Johnson was nice. The veteran defensive end has long been one of the NFL's most underrated players, despite being hurt much of this past season.\n2 | [](/NE) Patriots | Successful free agency strategies are often dependent on signing a couple of mid-tier guys who keep the team championship-viable. Receiver Chris Hogan can be that player. Had Julian Edelman not been hurt for the last seven regular-season games of 2015, New England would have likely finished with the top seed in the AFC. That would've changed everything in the postseason. Hogan, who was sneaky good for the Bills the last couple of years, is an upgrade over Brandon LaFell. Oh yeah, and I guess trading defensive end Chandler Jones to the Cardinals for Jonathan Cooper and a second-round pick was kind of a big deal, too. It looks to be a win-win situation for both teams. The Chris Long signing: A little Chandler Jones fallback, with solid veteran attitude.\n3 | [](/ARI) Cardinals | Like Carolina, the Cardinals needed a pass rusher. They couldn't just rely on calling Dwight Freeney -- again -- or, say, \"Too Tall\" Jones to come off the couch and lead the team in sacks. Enter Chandler Jones, who should form a promising duo with Markus Golden. On the other side of the ball, Carson Palmer's play in the 2015 postseason -- 59.3 percent completion rate, four TDs against six INTs and a 67.1 passer rating in two games -- must be a slight concern. Re-signing backup Drew Stanton was smart. It's those kinds of moves that earn teams a win or two. Let's not forget how 2014 played out for this group.\n4 | [](/PIT) Steelers | These could be your 2016 Super Bowl champs right here -- yes, even with the exciting-but-inconsistent Martavis Bryant suspended for the year. The key, beyond the health factor, is the secondary. How much will the organization hit that group in the draft? Thankfully, my cousin-in-law pointed out that Senquez Golson, the Steelers' second-round pick in 2015, didn't play last year. Easy to forget those rookie medical guys. With the return of Golson -- a product of Ole Miss, which also happens to be my cousin-in-law's alma mater, thus explaining the motivation for championing a backup DB -- Pittsburgh doesn't need as much help as is being put out there on the Interwebs. The defense fared better than any league observer thought it would last season ... well enough to win it at all, had the offense (which, at various points of the year, was without Ben Roethlisberger, Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown) stayed healthy. My cousin-in-law did not want his name used for this blurb, so all I will say is that it rhymes with \"Davey.\"\n5 | [](/GB) Packers | Receiver Jordy Nelson -- who missed the 2015 season with a torn ACL -- will be back healthy. Ditto Randall Cobb, who should also be twice as effective with Nelson returning. Running back Eddie Lacy should be slimmer and ready to go. Linebacker Nick Perry was re-signed. And let us not forget the return of middle linebacker Sam Barrington. As for the \"Why aren't the Packers making moves??\" nonsense -- why do they have to? These guys should've beaten Seattle in the 2014 NFC Championship Game. Last season, all beat to hell, they still gave the Cardinals a run for their money in the playoffs. Getting another back -- like, say, Arian Foster on the cheap -- as insurance for Lacy would be nice.\n6 | [](/DEN) Broncos | Sanchez. Stephenson. Free agency. Get excited. John Elway raised more than a few eyebrows by not convincing quarterback Brock Osweiler to stay in the mix. But look at it this way: Now the Broncos have a great chance to lead the league in interceptions two years in a row! Having the defending Super Bowl champs start at No. 6 is not ideal, obviously, but given their QB situation, as well as the departures of Malik Jackson and Danny Trevathan, there was no choice. I don't blame Elway for not ponying up for Osweiler or Jackson, so don't read this ranking as an indictment of the general manager. But Trevathan?\n7 | [](/SEA) Seahawks | What will Pete Carroll's team look like in 2016? The guess here is it'll probably be closer to the scoring machine we saw from Week 12 on last season than the ball control, play defense and out-physical you squad we saw from 2012 to '14. Running back Marshawn Lynch and defensive tackle Brandon Mebane -- core players on a squad that has fielded a top-five rushing attack and a top-five overall defense in each of the past four seasons -- are gone. Can second-year pro Thomas Rawls -- recovering from a fractured ankle -- be the workhorse who moves the chains enough to burn clock and let the Bobby Wagners of the world rest their legs? Maybe he won't have to, with the way Russell Wilson (2,146 passing yards, 25 passing TDs, two picks and a 124.3 passer rating over the final eight games) fared late in 2015. Losing linebacker Bruce Irvin to free agency hurt, too.\n8 | [](/KC) Chiefs | Not ready to have the Chiefs leapfrog the Seahawks just yet. As impressive as Kansas City's 11-game winning streak (including the playoffs) was last season, bear in mind that it coincided with the schedule becoming markedly easier. Love the moves the front office made in bringing back Eric Berry and long-time vets like Derrick Johnson and Tamba Hali. Draft and retain, man. That said, grabbing a guy like Mitchell Schwartz to bolster the offensive line made sense.\n9 | [](/CIN) Bengals | Wow, where to put the Bengals? This is still one of the strongest teams in the AFC. Thank goodness they kept Adam Jones and let both of their free-agent wide receivers walk. So now when A.J. Green is getting blanketed every play, the cornerback can walk over and argue with the refs. We kid, we kid. Felt Cincy needed to keep either Mohamed Sanu or Marvin Jones, although Marvin Jones will make more money in Detroit ($40 million over five years, with $17 million fully guaranteed) than Cincinnati owner Mike Brown was going to pay. So let's see what seventh-round pick Mario Alford -- who can run faster than a '93 Ford Probe GT -- can do. The defection that I am really worried about: Hue Jackson.\n10 | [](/MIN) Vikings | From the national perspective, the Vikings barely made a peep in free agency. The big splash play was absent. Make no mistake, though: The organization was active. Signing Alex Boone was a nice move. Way to go get a guard. Football games are still won in the G-C-G area of the field. Moreover, letting Mike Wallace go was the right call. He was not a key piece to Minnesota repeating as NFC North champs in 2016. Love that the Vikes signed Terence Newman. You can never have enough Terence Newmans in your locker room.\n11 | [](/WAS) Redskins | How will the Redskins fare in 2016? Well, if success in modern pro football is contingent on having continuity at head coach and quarterback, Washington has that. Notice the words that begin with \"con\" in the previous sentence. Appropriate, as the prefix \"con-\" means \"together,\" and -- perhaps because of Kirk Cousins' infectious attitude (and catchphrases) -- this team played together last season. OK, so that's Simple Simon reasoning, but playing as a team is so underrated in this era of Let's go buy a defense roster construction (SEE: Giants, New York football). Now, we should note that if the Redskins don't develop a running game, there will be plenty of consternation in D.C.\n12 | [](/HOU) Texans | Houston immediately looks stronger on paper. The football team, not the city. The latter always seems to play second sister to Dallas, even though Nolan Ryan is from those parts. Even though it's bigger (in both population and area) than Big D. Even though the Oilers' uniforms were the coolest in NFL history. We digress. Maybe Brock Osweiler will develop into the type of player who vaults the Texans into the national football consciousness, perhaps one notch ahead of the Cowboys. If he does, it will be due in no small part to the signing of running back Lamar Miller, who couldn't buy 20 carries while stuck on the Joe Philbin-era Dolphins. Houston coach Bill O'Brien will feed him.\n\n* [For #13-27](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4aqmme/nflcom_power_rankings/d12ppkq)\n\n* [For #28-32](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4aqmme/nflcom_power_rankings/d12psha)\n"], [7, "Open page.

The worry is the pass rush, though re-signing Charles Johnson was nice. The veteran defensive end has long been one of the NFL's most underrated players, despite being hurt much of this past season.\n2 | [](/NE) Patriots | Successful free agency strategies are often dependent on signing a couple of mid-tier guys who keep the team championship-viable. Receiver Chris Hogan can be that player. Had Julian Edelman not been hurt for the last seven regular-season games of 2015, New England would have likely finished with the top seed in the AFC. That would've changed everything in the postseason. Hogan, who was sneaky good for the Bills the last couple of years, is an upgrade over Brandon LaFell. Oh yeah, and I guess trading defensive end Chandler Jones to the Cardinals for Jonathan Cooper and a second-round pick was kind of a big deal, too. It looks to be a win-win situation for both teams. The Chris Long signing: A little Chandler Jones fallback, with solid veteran attitude.\n3 | [](/ARI) Cardinals | Like Carolina, the Cardinals needed a pass rusher. They couldn't just rely on calling Dwight Freeney -- again -- or, say, \"Too Tall\" Jones to come off the couch and lead the team in sacks. Enter Chandler Jones, who should form a promising duo with Markus Golden. On the other side of the ball, Carson Palmer's play in the 2015 postseason -- 59.3 percent completion rate, four TDs against six INTs and a 67.1 passer rating in two games -- must be a slight concern. Re-signing backup Drew Stanton was smart. It's those kinds of moves that earn teams a win or two. Let's not forget how 2014 played out for this group.\n4 | [](/PIT) Steelers | These could be your 2016 Super Bowl champs right here -- yes, even with the exciting-but-inconsistent Martavis Bryant suspended for the year. The key, beyond the health factor, is the secondary. How much will the organization hit that group in the draft? Thankfully, my cousin-in-law pointed out that Senquez Golson, the Steelers' second-round pick in 2015, didn't play last year. Easy to forget those rookie medical guys. With the return of Golson -- a product of Ole Miss, which also happens to be my cousin-in-law's alma mater, thus explaining the motivation for championing a backup DB -- Pittsburgh doesn't need as much help as is being put out there on the Interwebs. The defense fared better than any league observer thought it would last season ... well enough to win it at all, had the offense (which, at various points of the year, was without Ben Roethlisberger, Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown) stayed healthy. My cousin-in-law did not want his name used for this blurb, so all I will say is that it rhymes with \"Davey.\"\n5 | [](/GB) Packers | Receiver Jordy Nelson -- who missed the 2015 season with a torn ACL -- will be back healthy. Ditto Randall Cobb, who should also be twice as effective with Nelson returning. Running back Eddie Lacy should be slimmer and ready to go. Linebacker Nick Perry was re-signed. And let us not forget the return of middle linebacker Sam Barrington. As for the \"Why aren't the Packers making moves??\" nonsense -- why do they have to? These guys should've beaten Seattle in the 2014 NFC Championship Game. Last season, all beat to hell, they still gave the Cardinals a run for their money in the playoffs. Getting another back -- like, say, Arian Foster on the cheap -- as insurance for Lacy would be nice.\n6 | [](/DEN) Broncos | Sanchez. Stephenson. Free agency. Get excited. John Elway raised more than a few eyebrows by not convincing quarterback Brock Osweiler to stay in the mix. But look at it this way: Now the Broncos have a great chance to lead the league in interceptions two years in a row! Having the defending Super Bowl champs start at No. 6 is not ideal, obviously, but given their QB situation, as well as the departures of Malik Jackson and Danny Trevathan, there was no choice. I don't blame Elway for not ponying up for Osweiler or Jackson, so don't read this ranking as an indictment of the general manager. But Trevathan?\n7 | [](/SEA) Seahawks | What will Pete Carroll's team look like in 2016? The guess here is it'll probably be closer to the scoring machine we saw from Week 12 on last season than the ball control, play defense and out-physical you squad we saw from 2012 to '14. Running back Marshawn Lynch and defensive tackle Brandon Mebane -- core players on a squad that has fielded a top-five rushing attack and a top-five overall defense in each of the past four seasons -- are gone. Can second-year pro Thomas Rawls -- recovering from a fractured ankle -- be the workhorse who moves the chains enough to burn clock and let the Bobby Wagners of the world rest their legs? Maybe he won't have to, with the way Russell Wilson (2,146 passing yards, 25 passing TDs, two picks and a 124.3 passer rating over the final eight games) fared late in 2015. Losing linebacker Bruce Irvin to free agency hurt, too.\n8 | [](/KC) Chiefs | Not ready to have the Chiefs leapfrog the Seahawks just yet. As impressive as Kansas City's 11-game winning streak (including the playoffs) was last season, bear in mind that it coincided with the schedule becoming markedly easier. Love the moves the front office made in bringing back Eric Berry and long-time vets like Derrick Johnson and Tamba Hali. Draft and retain, man. That said, grabbing a guy like Mitchell Schwartz to bolster the offensive line made sense.\n9 | [](/CIN) Bengals | Wow, where to put the Bengals? This is still one of the strongest teams in the AFC. Thank goodness they kept Adam Jones and let both of their free-agent wide receivers walk. So now when A.J. Green is getting blanketed every play, the cornerback can walk over and argue with the refs. We kid, we kid. Felt Cincy needed to keep either Mohamed Sanu or Marvin Jones, although Marvin Jones will make more money in Detroit ($40 million over five years, with $17 million fully guaranteed) than Cincinnati owner Mike Brown was going to pay. So let's see what seventh-round pick Mario Alford -- who can run faster than a '93 Ford Probe GT -- can do. The defection that I am really worried about: Hue Jackson.\n10 | [](/MIN) Vikings | From the national perspective, the Vikings barely made a peep in free agency. The big splash play was absent. Make no mistake, though: The organization was active. Signing Alex Boone was a nice move. Way to go get a guard. Football games are still won in the G-C-G area of the field. Moreover, letting Mike Wallace go was the right call. He was not a key piece to Minnesota repeating as NFC North champs in 2016. Love that the Vikes signed Terence Newman. You can never have enough Terence Newmans in your locker room.\n11 | [](/WAS) Redskins | How will the Redskins fare in 2016? Well, if success in modern pro football is contingent on having continuity at head coach and quarterback, Washington has that. Notice the words that begin with \"con\" in the previous sentence. Appropriate, as the prefix \"con-\" means \"together,\" and -- perhaps because of Kirk Cousins' infectious attitude (and catchphrases) -- this team played together last season. OK, so that's Simple Simon reasoning, but playing as a team is so underrated in this era of Let's go buy a defense roster construction (SEE: Giants, New York football). Now, we should note that if the Redskins don't develop a running game, there will be plenty of consternation in D.C.\n12 | [](/HOU) Texans | Houston immediately looks stronger on paper. The football team, not the city. The latter always seems to play second sister to Dallas, even though Nolan Ryan is from those parts. Even though it's bigger (in both population and area) than Big D. Even though the Oilers' uniforms were the coolest in NFL history. We digress. Maybe Brock Osweiler will develop into the type of player who vaults the Texans into the national football consciousness, perhaps one notch ahead of the Cowboys. If he does, it will be due in no small part to the signing of running back Lamar Miller, who couldn't buy 20 carries while stuck on the Joe Philbin-era Dolphins. Houston coach Bill O'Brien will feed him.\n\n* [For #13-27](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4aqmme/nflcom_power_rankings/d12ppkq)\n\n* [For #28-32](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4aqmme/nflcom_power_rankings/d12psha)\n", "id": "d12pjyi"}, {"comment": "[{Continued from 1-12}](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4aqmme/nflcom_power_rankings/d12pjyi)\n{Comment 2 out of 3}\n\nRank | Team | Description\n----|----|-----------\n13 | [](/OAK) Raiders | Hey, it's a new league year, and I can put the Raiders as high as I want. Do I think they're hovering around wild-card status right now? Yes, I do. While giving the benefit of the doubt to the participants in the 2015 postseason field for now, Oakland is as ready as any ballclub to push one of those AFC teams (say, the Texans, Bengals or Chiefs) out. New linebacker Bruce Irvin might not be a 10-sack guy annually, but have fun facing him and that (Khalil) Mack truck playing on the other side. Signing offensive lineman Kelechi Osemele made much sense. All those who were angry Oakland quarterback Derek Carr didn't make my All-Under-25 Team earlier this month, well, it was because he's going to turn 25 on March 28, which is prior to the 2016 season kickoff, which disqualified him from consideration. Still, Carr is further along than fellow 2014 draftees Teddy Bridgewater and Blake Bortles right now.\n14 | [](/BUF) Bills | Guessing Bills fans are upset receiver Chris Hogan won't be running around Ralph Wilson Stadium this year. Or maybe they're more upset that he will -- for the Evil Empire. Seriously, Hogan joining the AFC East-ruling Patriots would be like Chewbacca fitting his hairy pits into an XXXL stormtrooper outfit (that option cannot be unlocked in \"Star Wars: Battlefront\"). You know what? That's economics. Football economics -- a course I plan to teach at Adams College this summer -- dictates that teams must pay to retain their offensive lines. That's where pro football is won. If only the Browns were paying attention, say, in this instance, or this instance.\n15 | [](/DAL) Cowboys | As long as Tony Romo stays upright, the Cowboys are a playoff team; It's that cut-and-dried. Under that premise, we can assume the offense will be fine. The defense is the side of the ball everyone questions, and I'm not sure why. This unit kept the cruddy law firm of Weeden, Cassel & Moore in games all season. Did league analysts expect the D to hold the fort while the offense was a three-and-out machine? The Randy Gregory suspension hurts, but re-signing Rolando McClain and adding a run-stuffer in Cedric Thornton were both good moves. Again, it's all about shaved collarbones and 35-year-old quarterbacks in Dallas.\n16 | [](/NYG) Giants | Everyone reading this far down the rankings has probably wondered, \"Where are the Giants?\" Well, the Power Rankings do not equal an ode to big free agency moves. Can a front office retool a defense with a bunch of contractors? Most of the time, it doesn't work. Why doubt Big Blue's spending spree? A) These players have never played with each other, or in coordinator Steve Spagnuolo's scheme. B) There is a reason their former clubs didn't want to pony up the money the Giants did. Defensive end Olivier Vernon, cornerback Janoris Jenkins and nose tackle Damon Harrison certainly improve the talent level, but will the boost translate to the Giants' first playoff spot in five years? Think Harrison -- who, by the way, owns a heckuva last name -- will bring serious toughness to a unit that desperately needs it.\n17 | [](/IND) Colts | The fact that the Colts finished last season at 8-8 -- despite the quarterback carousel and coaching turmoil -- speaks to the character of the players in the locker room ... or does it? According to the recently departed Coby Fleener, some of the guys were chillin' all season. What we do know is that the caveman tight end will be missed, as will Matt Hasselbeck's veteran presence. It's not often Indy is the fourth-most-talked-about team in the AFC South, but that's been the case of late. The Colts still have Andrew Luck, though, and that keeps them above the Jaguars and Titans.\n18 | [](/JAC) Jaguars | Surprised? Don't be. The Jaguars showed signs of turning the losing culture around last season via an explosive offense. Now Gus Bradley has tools to work with on defense, given the arrivals of Malik Jackson and Tashaun Gipson, among others. Offensively, Jacksonville added Chris Ivory, one of the true thumpers in pro football. He'll nicely complement T.J. Yeldon in providing a ground game for young QB Blake Bortles, who certainly doesn't need to have everything on his shoulders in Year 3. Speaking of, Jags fans were quite upset I chose Teddy Bridgewater over Bortles on my All-Under-25 Team. If I had to do it again, I might go with the latter. It was hard to get over the devastating turnovers. So many of Bortles' picks really cost his team (and undermined his productivity). Meanwhile, Bridgewater was not asked to drop back as much; rather, he had to convert third downs and let the run game and defense do much of the work. These two young field generals are just tasked with different assignments.\n19 | [](/ATL) Falcons | Better keep an eye on these Falcons. Sure, the 2-7 finish sucked. The defense couldn't hold the fort when the offense was moving, and the offense put the defense in bad positions with untimely turnovers. (The red-zone turnovers were particularly alarming.) The interesting note here is that as much as people have been concerned about Dan Quinn's D, the O was the losing side of the middling 8-8 record. Thankfully, the front office recognizes that deal, and made amends by signing Alex Mack and Mohamed Sanu.\n20 | [](/TB) Buccaneers | The Bucs did themselves right by re-upping Doug Martin to a five-year deal. Yes, I know: Running backs have a short shelf life. But Martin is still a reasonable 27 years old -- and he just finished second in the league in rushing while compiling 1,673 yards from scrimmage. Young QB Jameis Winston needs that kinda support in the backfield. Also liked the signing of one Robert Ayers, who has been a solid pro. Did he have a breakout campaign in a contract year? Perhaps. But Tampa Bay needs another pass rusher to contend. It's that elementary.\n21 | [](/MIA) Dolphins | We can speak of free agency until the cows come home, yet the great elixir for the Dolphins is what Adam Gase squeezes from Ryan Tannehill's evolution. It also just dawned on me that Tannehill probably has seen cows come home before. He certainly is faring better than another Texas A&M quarterback. Meanwhile, an older former Aggie QB recently won a Super Bowl with a mixture of defense and timely offense -- a blueprint that wouldn't be so bad for Gase, either, given the personnel (like, say, new addition Mario Williams). Still, the overall plan seems unclear -- agree with my colleague Gregg Rosenthal's take.\n22 | [](/DET) Lions | The gleam of hope after the 6-2 finish has morphed into darkness in a post-Megatron football world. But all is not lost. Picking up Marvin Jones was a master stroke, even though he is not Calvin Johnson. Re-signing Haloti Ngata and Tyrunn Walker made much dollars and sense. On the subject of the defensive line, heard from a few fans of the Honolulu Blue in the wake of Olivier Vernon's monster deal. Detroit might have to hold a million-man raffle to re-up Ziggy Ansah when his contract runs out. Holy cow.\n23 | [](/BAL) Ravens | Puzzling free-agency period for the Ravens -- not necessarily in a bad way, just ... interesting. They lost Kelechi Osemele to a big bidder while adding veteran Benjamin Watson. Mid-30s Watson seems like an odd fit, but we'll see how he tandems with Maxx Williams. Baltimore didn't have the money to compete with the Raiders to sign the talented Osemele, but the team did carry the bucks to go out and snatch Eric Weddle, in a somewhat unforeseen move. As for the Mike Wallace signing? I'll get excited if/when it pays off. Indirectly throwing your former QB under the bus sure is an ominous start.\n24 | [](/PHI) Eagles | The Eagles got their quarterback ... or two. They also got rid of some contracts and remnants of the Chip Kelly era. Seriously, it's as though he was an Etch A Sketch that the front office was champing at the bit to shake the minute the door closed behind him. Oh, yes. Forgot our NFL.com age demographic. Here is an Etch A Sketch, everybody.\n25 | [](/NYJ) Jets | If the Jets go into the season with only Geno Smith and Bryce Petty, this is where they'll stay in the Power Rankings. As of this writing, New York was sans a postseason-ready quarterback, with no IK Enemkpali around to save their season. (If something like that did go down -- again -- we would find out real quick about Petty. Perhaps Todd Bowles and Co. are far higher on the young signal caller than we all think?) This staredown with Ryan Fitzpatrick is moving into uncomfortable territory, as otherwise, this is a 10-win football team.\n26 | [](/CHI) Bears | John Fox's retooling process slowly begins with the arrivals of Danny Trevathan, Jerrell Freeman and Akiem Hicks on defense. Of course, one wonders if the Bears will even know how to air up the footballs at practice now that Adam Gase is gone (just a slightly sarcastic reference to the overwhelmingly glowing pub he's received this offseason). Fox wants to run the football and play defense, as shown by the front office's attempt to acquire C.J. Anderson. How about finding out how durable Jeremy Langford is without assuming he can't handle 20 carries per game?\n27 | [](/LA) Rams | While the move to Los Angeles still dominates the talk around this franchise, more than a few league observers are wondering about the quarterback situation. Case Keenum is No. 1 on the depth charts and in your hearts. The heart and soul of this team is the gliding stride of Todd Gurley (as seen here), which, if complemented correctly, should be married to a stout defense. That is the tough part for Los Angeles (still feels weird to type), which lost solid contributors in Chris Long, James Laurinaitis and Janoris Jenkins. Jeff Fisher has his work cut out for him to even get back to the glory days of 7-9.\n\nContinued...", "id": "d12ppkq"}, {"comment": "[{Continued from 13-27}](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4aqmme/nflcom_power_rankings/d12ppkq) {Comment 3 out of 3}\n\nRank | Team | Description\n----|----|-----------\n28 | [](/NO) Saints | More than any other organization in the NFL, the Saints are depending on the health of their quarterback and a stout draft in order to compete in 2016. New Orleans hasn't enjoyed boatloads of cap space for some time now, so there will be no band of free agents to truly fix a defense that allowed a staggering 476 points. In fact, as of this writing, the Saints have the lowest amount of cap space in the league. Maybe the Coby Fleener signing -- five years, $36 million -- gets you all hot and bothered. It signals to me that, sans a wonderful haul in the draft, Sean Payton will be trying to win games 40-38 again.\n29 | [](/SD) Chargers | San Diego could bolt up the 405 right past Los Angeles and up these Power Rankings in a New York minute with a strong draft. Of the teams I graded after the initial wave of free agency, the Chargers were one of the few in the \"A\" range. Getting Travis Benjamin masks the loss of Malcom Floyd while simultaneously helping the special teams. The defensive line sorely needed a Brandon Mebane. Meanwhile, the Casey Hayward addition was one of those several-days-after-the-free-agent-musical-chairs-explosion-period signings that fly under the radar, yet win games.\n30 | [](/SF) 49ers | So much of the banter involving the 49ers revolves around an overrated quarterback who is often frenetic in the pocket -- it's becoming increasingly difficult to remember there are more than 50 other guys on this football team. Maybe the Niners eventually will take that fourth-rounder from Big John, but they certainly are looking for a bigger offer (like, a third). There is talent on this team, from NaVorro Bowman to Aaron Lynch to Quinton Dial to developmental players like Bruce Ellington and Jaquiski Tartt. The latter sounds like something you get with an umbrella in an overpriced L.A. speakeasy, but Tartt did start as a rookie. He has some pop. I'll be here all week. Tip somebody.\n31 | [](/TEN) Titans | This ranking might seem harsh, especially with the excitement that acquiring DeMarco Murray brings. Yet, is he the right fit for the offense? If Marcus Mariota is in the shotgun often -- see: read-option looks -- then the answer is likely no. That didn't work in Philadelphia. Murray is a north-south runner who does better in a single-back system with the QB under center. On the flip side, if Mariota takes off more, he will force defenses to respect his running ability, thus forcing defenses to play 11-on-11. Whereas, with Sam Bradford at Murray's side in Philly, all the focus was on the tailback. Bradford is less of a threat to run than Jurrell Casey. Schematically speaking, the Murray trade was the most interesting move of this offseason.\n32 | [](/CLE) Browns | You must feel for Hue Jackson. The man has been handed a Tomsula burger. The nice element to the mass departures is that Jackson has a blank slate to start with ... as in blank stares from a bunch of rookies who can't play. The Browns say they want to draft and keep players. The question is, how do you not keep several of your own who left last week?

Some of the writers are great (Matt Bowen, Rivers McCown) others are pretty bad (Tanier, Freeman), so it's still the same in regards to the content being *very* hit or miss.

Now there's separating it from the other sites, and there are simply better options out there with more quality writers. Simms isn't a great analyst, Cole is pretty poor compared to other leading insiders, some really bad writers that do headlining stories, overuse of slideshows, countless rankings, etc. \n\nI really disagree that B/r is still suffering from their old reputation.

Naughright's probably not involved in the current lawsuit, either. More on that in a moment.\n\nBut first off... Naughright has never sued or pressed charges against Manning for the alleged event. She reached a settlement with the university, not with Manning.\n\nThen in 2002 she sued him... not for sexual harassment but for defamation... along with his father and their ghostwriter because of comments made about her in the book *Manning: A Father, His Sons, and a Football Legacy*. \n\nWhile she wasn't named, she was depicted as being vulgar and behaving inappropriately.\n\nThis document containing her side of the event was a \"statement of facts\" filed with the courts on October 15, 2003 as a part of that defamation lawsuit. \n\nThey reached another settlement. \n\nThen in 2005, after her photograph and a description of the alleged event was aired in *ESPN Classic Sports Century - Peyton Manning*, she sued him for a breach of their settlement agreement. \n\nHe countersued because of statements Naughright made to Florida-Times Union sportswriter Mike Freeman. \n\nThey reached a settlement in July of 2005.\n\nNow six women are [suing the University of Tennessee](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/02/13/ut-sex-assault-lawsuit-cites-peyton-manning/80356208/)... not Peyton Manning... alleging that they covered up acts of sexual harassment. \n\nDr. Jamie Naughright is not one of the listed plaintiffs. (But since they are all listed as Jane Doe, so she might be involved in the lawsuit.)\n\nManning's incident is one of nearly a dozen that are mentioned, but none of the ten alleged or actual offenders are parties to the lawsuit, they are not listed as defendents, and they will not be called to testify.\n\nWhat is being challenged in court is the university's handling of the matters... which is done by simply reviewing the records. The plaintiffs allege a systemic pattern of abuse and cover-ups, and (naturally) they are looking for money.\n\nManning will not be made to defend himself, though the university may be asked to defend their handling of the matter at the time. \n\nManning won't be required to make a statement, he won't be required to testify, he won't have any participation in the case at all. \n\nSo, to reiterate, there won't ever be an official response from Manning, nor will there be any sort of ruling because she has already received a settlement regarding the matter.

It does not compare to Seattle, Denver or San Francisco, all of which I have lived in or visited extensively.\n\nYou're anecdotal experience in a couple cities does not really mean squat. Sorry. Portland has a city population of 619k and a metro population of 2.35m. Seattle has 662k and 3.6m. Denver 663k and 2.75m.

Indianapolis, 820k and 1.75m. Nashville, 659k and 1.75m. Buffalo, 259k and 1.13m. Jacksonville, 821k and 1.4m. Also about the same metro population as San Antonio, technically slightly larger.  I won't even go over Green Bay again, we've been over that. That's 8 NFL cities. A quarter of the League.\n\nYou can cherry pick bigger cities in the NFL all you want, there are several, but Portland has a larger population than a quarter of the current NFL cities.\n\nSo please, tell me more about how Portland is too small to support an NFL team?

Multiple cities currently do so with less. Another commenter from Portland pointed out they are in the process of building several new hotels in the area in fact, including a 600 room hotel and convention center. If a city has the infrastructure to handle a convention, they have the infrastructure to handle an NFL game.\n\nYou're so hung up on how small the city is and it makes no sense. For one, it's still bigger than multiple current NFL cities, as I've stated. For two, the entire metro area is what would support the team, not just people in the city limits. Several NFL teams don't even play in the city limits of the city they're named for. The New York Giants and Jets play in fucking New Jersey. The Cowboys are in Arlington. The 49ers in Santa Clara.

I get it, it's \"regional\", but I loathe everything about Seattle and I can't bring myself to root for them. So I do hope Portland gets a team at some point in the future, but unless expansion happens it's probably unlikely. \n\n\nEdit: Portland has a shit load of hotel rooms, and there's literally like 10 under construction/soon to be under construction in the vicinity of downtown alone, including a 600 room convention center hotel. I don't see how hotels are relevant though. There's plenty of hotels in the area that could support a football team.\n\n\nEdit 2: I'm wondering why you're so fixated on the city limits. Yes, Portland is pretty built out within city limits and other than some empty land by the airport there's not a lot of open space. A stadium wouldn't have to be in city limits though.
