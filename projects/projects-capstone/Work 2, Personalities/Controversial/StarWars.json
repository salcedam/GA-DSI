I certainly have acted like him in the past, saying things just as awkward if not more so to others.  \n\nNow, perhaps this is not an advantage in a movie, which I think many watch as a form of escapism (I certainly do).  Perhaps people feel uncomfortable when characters are more accurate reflections of themselves, showing them an outside perspective of the things they may dislike about themselves.

I always got the feeling that while she does have a certain amount of admiration for the commitment the Jedi have to their duty, she thinks that their rigid rules on attachment lead to more harm than good. Anakin is a special case because he was recruited very late on to become a Jedi, but Anakin's emotional instability and confusion only cement Padme's thoughts, at least in my mind, which is perhaps why she seems to see him as troubled and broken rather than insane.\n\nBut then again, I may be completely off base!", "id": "d14x6z9"}, {"comment": "> However what I find hard to buy is how Padme could still be in love with a guy who openly admits he slaughter women and children when he's angry.\n\nThank you!

Palps did it though the dark side. But if you can scan the persons brain and recreate their brain pattern then there will be a perfect clone of them that thinks and acts like them. That is what thrawn was going to do, and its how cloning working in a lot of other Sci-fi series. So i could upload my brain scan every few months as a sort of save file.

To be fair, Luke was pretty whiny in Ep. 4 but once he became an active member of the rebellion he was pretty badass.

Screw it, Jedi can move things with their minds, have the power of manipulation, and sense other beings that have the force, why not have them see the future too.\" If Jedi have visions of the future and the universe at the time had hundreds of Jedi, how come not one of them foresaw Order 66?

But I think letting Maul live would be a violation of rule number 1, as it would seriously affect the plot of the trilogy as a whole.

He should've had an overarching enemy that wasn't just Palpatine, as it would also prove to be a distraction. Thinking Maul is the Sith Lord.

Essentially we get it boiled down to the fact that Anakin kills Padme.\n\nWhen Obi Wan arrives on Mustafar with Padme and C3PO he leaves Padme and C3PO on the ship. Obi Wan then confronts Anakin in the room where all of the Separatists were murdered by Anakin. After seeing all of the bloodshed on Mustafar Obi Wan confirms to himself that Anakin truly was the person who attacked the Jedi Temple and killed all of the younglings. That is when Obi Wan decides that Anakin can not be allowed to leave Mustafar. Obi Wan must kill Anakin.\n\nFor Anakin he senses Padme due to the twins, which Anakin only sees as one embodiment. Anakin feels that he must be with Padme for the birth of their children. To be with Padme he must kill Obi Wan.\n\nThe fight continues like it does in the movie, both Anakin and Obi Wan matching each other blow for blow. This all leads up to the fight getting closer and closer to the ship that Padme is on. This is when Padme leaves the ship. Padme feels that she is the only person who will be able to stop the fighting.\n\nAnakin sees Padme. He tries to catch Obi Wan off guard so that he can reunite with her. When Anakin makes the move to go for her Obi Wan then removes both of Anakin's legs and his one arm. In his anger Anakin decides that if he can not be with Padme then no one can. This is when we see Anakin use the Force Choke for the first time. Anakin chokes the life out of Padme with his one hand that he still has. Obi Wan then uses Force Push to try and get Anakin as far away from Padme as he can to try and save her life. Anakin is now on the coast of the lava where he suffers most of his burning.\n\nObi Wan then carries Padme back to the ship. C3PO asks if she is alright. The small medical droid says that Padme has passed and must be taken to the nearest medical bay to try and save the life of the children. Obi Wan gets in contact with Yoda and Senator Organa and has them both meet him at the med bay. After the twins are born Senator Organa offers to adopt the girl. He names her Leia, after his Grandmother. Yoda reminds Obi Wan of Anakin's family on Tatooine. Obi Wan takes the boy to the farm. There Owen and Beru name the boy Luke, after Beru's father.\n\nAfter Palpatine collects Anakin he places him inside of the suit. Palpatine then informs Anakin that due to him killing Padme the child she was carrying had died (Palpatine however knows that this is not true. He would use the Force to eventually try to manipulate Luke into joining the Imperial Academy.) Palpatine has sufficiently angered Anakin.

You don't even have to change much about the rest of the plot, just focus more on his emotional journey as the center of the film.

To be fair, Luke was pretty whiny in Ep. 4 but once he became an active member of the rebellion he was pretty badass. If we got to see Anakin bring out the same kind of badassery Luke did in, for example, Jabba's Palace, I think that would have made me enjoy the character a hell of a lot more. \n\nEDIT: In fact, lets cross out the whole future vision thing. Let's say instead of him looking to the dark side to resurrect Padme, he does it because of the Jedis celibacy oath. The whole vision thing felt like a cop out.

Screw it, Jedi can move things with their minds, have the power of manipulation, and sense other beings that have the force, why not have them see the future too.\" If Jedi have visions of the future and the universe at the time had hundreds of Jedi, how come not one of them foresaw Order 66?

Sure they are pretty essential to good movie making, but alot of people make it seem like every decision that was made in the prequels was horrible and they are complete betreyals. They are a step down, sure but when you get down to it, the story is fine to me so much so that everything bad in the movies can be traced back to what they say and how they say it. Even Jar Jar Binks. Bad dialogue and performed in an annoying way.

Kylo operates outside the traditional command structure of the First Order, it's not down to him to discipline every stormtrooper who slips up. Finn wasn't exactly committing an act of high treason by not firing his blaster at some defenseless villagers on his first mission in the field, and disciplining stormtroopers would be Captain Phasma's job anyway.

Not outside the realm of possibility to imagine she told Kylo too, and it's not too difficult to connect 1+1 when you see an insubordinate stormtrooper in the field, then you hear news of a stormtrooper going rogue several hours later, especially if there's practically no precedent for stormtrooper insubordination.\n\n>What has been overlooked, however, is the rage with which he reacts immediately after hearing Finn's identification number and his association with the droid's escape. He goes ape feces. Ignites his lightsaber and absolutely obliterates the console in front of him.\n\nHe's going \"ape feces\" because the incredibly important droid escaped, and the filmmakers needed a way to show the audience that this villain had a particularly short temper. The turncoat helping the droid is just a cherry on top of a pile of shit, and the girl is the sprinkles.\n\n>One thing that hasn't sat well with many people (myself included) is how easily Finn is able to wield and use a lightsaber in battle.\n\nThere is an entire scene (one of the most popular in the movie) dedicated to visually explaining how Finn has melee weapons training, when he spends several minutes duelling an otherwise run-of-the-mill stormtrooper who is wielding a riot baton.

So you can assume he has been with the First Order that long.  He is around 22, Rey is 19, so if she was around 5 when the Jedi Temple fell, and Ren was around 15, Finn would have been 8.\n\nI think they might have been friends or training partners or something.  Or maybe Ren saved his life at some point.  I personally don't think he is force sensitive though.  And I don't think he is necessarily the only one to defect...

The Force just lets you know stuff sometimes, even if it can be lazy writing.\n\nI actually think that Finn is Force-sensitive, and as I recall the novelization confirms it, but not everybody needs to have this dumb Jedi-in-training/Force-mind-wiped backstory that the fanbase is buying into lately. I concede that it's possible, and that the question of Rey's identity can serve as a clever distraction for any other secrets that might be in play, but I really don't want Finn to have that backstory. As it stands, Finn is a testament to free will and goodness in general; saying \"oh that's just because he was really a Jedi deep down\" is horse shit. Plenty of people willingly escape real-life oppressive, propaganda-spouting regimes such as North Korea, for example.\n\nAlso Finn Windu would be shit-tier fanservice that no one was asking for and the timeline doesn't work at all, unless he was Mace's grandkid, and if he was that it would take too long to explain and be completely meaningless to new viewers and non-fans. Not to mention that Finn looks literally nothing like Mace except that they're both black."], [4, "What if in the next one Finn is investigating/looking for his family. \n\nHe meets a hooded masked figure who owns a dodgey mining company.

I don't know why it's not more commonly brought up here, but the scene where he hears the screams of the victims of Starkiller Base before we see them and he turns to look after he hears them, when nobody else does is a definite indicator for me.\n\nI don't think he was in the academy however. If Kylo brought a trooper from the academy, you'd be damn sure he knew whether that trooper was going on a mission with him, he wouldn't be surprised by his presence. I think this was the first time Kylo noticed some sort of force-sensitivity in Finn, his \"awakening\" in a way, and his spouting of his identification number was after doing some research on him out of curiosity.\n\nHan was clumsy with the lightsaber on Hoth because he'd had no experience with them. We now know the First Order troopers were trained in the use of melee weapons and possibly in the countering of lightsabers, so probably knew a thing or two about swinging them too, even if they never held one, and that combined with force sensitivity made him at least competent with a saber, although nowhere near as talented as Rey was.\n\n>J.J. is also on record as saying the omission of Rey and Finn's surnames is absolutely intentional\n\nI could be wrong on this, but we might already know why his surname left out- he doesn't have one? Is it not likely that JJ just didn't tell us about him being a stormtrooper and not having an actual name so we had some details left in the film, rather than some big reveal? Even Rey's name to an extent was left out because maybe she doesn't know it? Sure she might be a Solo or a Skywalker, but we don't know that, we have solid reasons for both of these characters being named by first name only.\n\nI do think Finn will play a much bigger part in the episodes to come, but I don't believe he was taken from the academy or that Kylo had any greater connection to him, in fact I would be surprised if he came face to face with Kylo again. Kylo's struggle is with Rey now, and Finn will probably be facing Phasma and Del Toro's character in VIII on his intergalactic road trip with Poe (pls Rian)."], [3, "I'd say this does not work. First, Finn has no signs of Force sensitivity, literally none. Every single thing he does that people attribute to the Force is skill, plain and simple. He's a highly trained soldier, that's the beginning and the end of it. You're attributing Kylo Ren's childish temper tantrums, which are due to his inability to properly channel his anger because of his incomplete training with the Dark Side, to some kind of reaction to something special about Finn. That is not the case. Furthermore it makes no sense at all for Kylo Ren to take Force sensitives to be Stormtroopers. You're also attributing Kylo's fanaticism for Snoke and the New Order to some kind of personal connection to Finn, yet you're completely glazing over the fact that Kylo makes zero actual effort to go after Finn and repeatedly ignores him entirely for Rey. \n\nThis is a well thought out, but highly unlikely theory. "], [3, "The problem I have with this is Finn's reactions to...everything in the movie. He is way to surprised with everything force/jedi related, and hell, by the existence of the jedi in general to have any prior experience with them. Even if they had wiped his mind or something like that (which I doubt. That's an incredible asspull.) if he were force sensitive enough for Luke to find and start training, he'd feel something, or get some kinda flashbacks or visions. He shows absolutely none of that.  \n  \nFinn is just a rogue stormtrooper. There's probably lots and lots of rogues that get caught and reconditioned. He's just a little lucky, and maybe has the force looking out for him a bit.

Ever."], [3, "> What makes Finn special? Why is he the one defective stormtrooper, despite (apparently) being raised identically to hundreds, thousands, of other troopers?\n\nWhile the indoctrination is quite effective, it's also not infallible. The response when command notes that Finn isn't performing the way he should be is for him to have additional conditioning. They also track infractions by these troopers, so they expect for the indoctrinating to be incomplete from time to time.\n\n> Finn was a student at Luke's Jedi Academy and was brought to the First Order by Kylo during his rebellion.\n\nKylo was a young adult when he murdered the order. Finn and Kylo are far too close in age for this to make sense.\n\n> Kylo noticing Finn on Jakku, and knowing his ID number immediately\n\nYou need to remember that Force Users, especially strong and well trained ones, are very receptive to the emotional state of others. He sensed the fear emanating from someone, and looks to the source. And he sees a Stormtrooper. As others have noted, Stormtroopers have HUDs that display each others ID codes. There's no reason to think Kylo doesn't have this in his helmet as well. This is how he knows exactly which Stormtrooper broke ranks.\n\n> How about the scene in which Kylo is informed that BB-8 had eluded the First Order on Jakku? What most theorists (including myself) have gleaned most from this scene is Kylo's reaction when he hears about \"a girl\" being involved in the droid's escape, force choking the informant, insinuating some prior knowledge of Rey.\n\nI think this is overthinking it. He asks \"WHAT GIRL!?\" because to this point, they were dealing with an awol Trooper and an escape prisoner, neither of whom were female. To hear that the droid is being aided by the Trooper and a new unknown element, he wants to know who this new person is and how they fall into the bigger picture.\n\n> What has been overlooked, however, is the rage with which he reacts immediately after hearing Finn's identification number and his association with the droid's escape. He goes ape feces. Ignites his lightsaber and absolutely obliterates the console in front of him.\n\nHe's mad because he insisted that the droid be captured at all costs, which was contrary to Snoke's order to ensure that the data not fall into the Resistances hands. So it's on his head that things were getting out of control, and he knows it'll land in his lap. We've also seen that Kylo doesn't handle things well when they don't go in his favor.\n\n> One thing that hasn't sat well with many people (myself included) is how easily Finn is able to wield and use a lightsaber in battle.\n\nIt's literally just a bar of plasma, using Ken-do techniques. And we know Stormtroopers are trained in various melee weapons, not just from Finns fight with Nines, but from the novels as well. On top of that, Finn's success rate with lightsabers is like 33%. He killed one trooper (and that was a sucker punch kill) before his old squadmate Nines challenges him and schools him. Kylo plays with him like a cat against a mouse before Finn got a lucky hit in, and Kylo put him down like the traitorous dog he was.\n\n> J.J. is also on record as saying the omission of Rey and Finn's surnames is absolutely intentional, which seems to suggest they are surnames we will be familiar with. I'm not ready to say \"Finn Windu\" just yet, but it would certainly harmonize with that nugget of info paired with everything I've listed out here.\n\nDon't think so. Finn's surname was omitted because he doesn't have one period. He doesn't even have a first name until Poe names him.\n\n> 'Is that how he would respond to just any rogue stormtrooper?'\n\nHe isn't just any rogue Stormtrooper. He's the rogue Stormtrooper that kept Kylo from finding Luke Skywalker for Snoke, made Kylo look like a fool, and was instrumental in the in process destruction of Starkiller base. This one traitor has cased Kylo and the First Order so much grief. Of course he would be extremely mad at such a traitor like that.\n\nI'm sorry, but despite your enthusiastic theory, the thing is, Finn is merely a human, who found himself in way over his head when he made a play for freedom.

I'm not keen of the memory wiping thing, its only really appeared in the films for androids and i think its now classes as Legend in the wookiepedia, i think it would feel a bit reaching if memory wipes etc come into play now, i am a believer they were taken at a too early age to remember properly but i do agree there maybe some prior knowledge or something from Rens side, but then surely [Film Scene Spoilers](/s \"he would have said something in the forest if he did know exactly who they were, remember Ren speaks to Snook to state how strong she is in the force when questioned he would state then if he knew there was a skywalker link\") - i think Reys history is completely unknown to the dark side, whereas Finn might have a twist somewhere!

He probably has basic training like army do, even for janitors. Which is why a storm trooper trained in melee combat easily overpowered him. \n\nI would say the biggest thing working against your theory is that we have zero evidence to suggest he has any force sensitivity. He never sensed danger or presence of Kylo or Rey. Much like Rey, I imagine if he had force powers, we would of seen them when he fought Kylo. If they were hidden/forgotten, that's when they would of naturally come out. They didn't. \n\nI think Finn will be the Han Solo of this trilogy. He will be the guy we love but he is just a guy.

Kylo operates outside the traditional command structure of the First Order, it's not down to him to discipline every stormtrooper who slips up. Finn wasn't exactly committing an act of high treason by not firing his blaster at some defenseless villagers on his first mission in the field, and disciplining stormtroopers would be Captain Phasma's job anyway.

Plenty of people willingly escape real-life oppressive, propaganda-spouting regimes such as North Korea, for example.\n\nAlso Finn Windu would be shit-tier fanservice that no one was asking for and the timeline doesn't work at all, unless he was Mace's grandkid, and if he was that it would take too long to explain and be completely meaningless to new viewers and non-fans.

If Kylo brought a trooper from the academy, you'd be damn sure he knew whether that trooper was going on a mission with him, he wouldn't be surprised by his presence. I think this was the first time Kylo noticed some sort of force-sensitivity in Finn, his \"awakening\" in a way, and his spouting of his identification number was after doing some research on him out of curiosity.\n\nHan was clumsy with the lightsaber on Hoth because he'd had no experience with them. We now know the First Order troopers were trained in the use of melee weapons and possibly in the countering of lightsabers, so probably knew a thing or two about swinging them too, even if they never held one, and that combined with force sensitivity made him at least competent with a saber, although nowhere near as talented as Rey was.\n\n>J.J. is also on record as saying the omission of Rey and Finn's surnames is absolutely intentional\n\nI could be wrong on this, but we might already know why his surname left out- he doesn't have one? Is it not likely that JJ just didn't tell us about him being a stormtrooper and not having an actual name so we had some details left in the film, rather than some big reveal? Even Rey's name to an extent was left out because maybe she doesn't know it? Sure she might be a Solo or a Skywalker, but we don't know that, we have solid reasons for both of these characters being named by first name only.\n\nI do think Finn will play a much bigger part in the episodes to come, but I don't believe he was taken from the academy or that Kylo had any greater connection to him, in fact I would be surprised if he came face to face with Kylo again.

That is not the case. Furthermore it makes no sense at all for Kylo Ren to take Force sensitives to be Stormtroopers. You're also attributing Kylo's fanaticism for Snoke and the New Order to some kind of personal connection to Finn, yet you're completely glazing over the fact that Kylo makes zero actual effort to go after Finn and repeatedly ignores him entirely for Rey. \n\nThis is a well thought out, but highly unlikely theory.

Why is he the one defective stormtrooper, despite (apparently) being raised identically to hundreds, thousands, of other troopers?\n\nWhile the indoctrination is quite effective, it's also not infallible. The response when command notes that Finn isn't performing the way he should be is for him to have additional conditioning. They also track infractions by these troopers, so they expect for the indoctrinating to be incomplete from time to time.\n\n> Finn was a student at Luke's Jedi Academy and was brought to the First Order by Kylo during his rebellion.\n\nKylo was a young adult when he murdered the order. Finn and Kylo are far too close in age for this to make sense.\n\n> Kylo noticing Finn on Jakku, and knowing his ID number immediately\n\nYou need to remember that Force Users, especially strong and well trained ones, are very receptive to the emotional state of others. He sensed the fear emanating from someone, and looks to the source. And he sees a Stormtrooper. As others have noted, Stormtroopers have HUDs that display each others ID codes. There's no reason to think Kylo doesn't have this in his helmet as well. This is how he knows exactly which Stormtrooper broke ranks.\n\n> How about the scene in which Kylo is informed that BB-8 had eluded the First Order on Jakku? What most theorists (including myself) have gleaned most from this scene is Kylo's reaction when he hears about \"a girl\" being involved in the droid's escape, force choking the informant, insinuating some prior knowledge of Rey.\n\nI think this is overthinking it. He asks \"WHAT GIRL!?\" because to this point, they were dealing with an awol Trooper and an escape prisoner, neither of whom were female. To hear that the droid is being aided by the Trooper and a new unknown element, he wants to know who this new person is and how they fall into the bigger picture.\n\n> What has been overlooked, however, is the rage with which he reacts immediately after hearing Finn's identification number and his association with the droid's escape. He goes ape feces. Ignites his lightsaber and absolutely obliterates the console in front of him.\n\nHe's mad because he insisted that the droid be captured at all costs, which was contrary to Snoke's order to ensure that the data not fall into the Resistances hands. So it's on his head that things were getting out of control, and he knows it'll land in his lap. We've also seen that Kylo doesn't handle things well when they don't go in his favor.\n\n> One thing that hasn't sat well with many people (myself included) is how easily Finn is able to wield and use a lightsaber in battle.\n\nIt's literally just a bar of plasma, using Ken-do techniques. And we know Stormtroopers are trained in various melee weapons, not just from Finns fight with Nines, but from the novels as well. On top of that, Finn's success rate with lightsabers is like 33%. He killed one trooper (and that was a sucker punch kill) before his old squadmate Nines challenges him and schools him. Kylo plays with him like a cat against a mouse before Finn got a lucky hit in, and Kylo put him down like the traitorous dog he was.\n\n> J.J. is also on record as saying the omission of Rey and Finn's surnames is absolutely intentional, which seems to suggest they are surnames we will be familiar with. I'm not ready to say \"Finn Windu\" just yet, but it would certainly harmonize with that nugget of info paired with everything I've listed out here.\n\nDon't think so. Finn's surname was omitted because he doesn't have one period. He doesn't even have a first name until Poe names him.\n\n> 'Is that how he would respond to just any rogue stormtrooper?'\n\nHe isn't just any rogue Stormtrooper. He's the rogue Stormtrooper that kept Kylo from finding Luke Skywalker for Snoke, made Kylo look like a fool, and was instrumental in the in process destruction of Starkiller base. This one traitor has cased Kylo and the First Order so much grief. Of course he would be extremely mad at such a traitor like that.\n\nI'm sorry, but despite your enthusiastic theory, the thing is, Finn is merely a human, who found himself in way over his head when he made a play for freedom.

If Plagueis won, even provisionally, it undercuts the threat Palpatine projects, and it undercuts Palpatine as a master manipulator, because he was, instead, being manipulated by Plagueis.\n\nThis isn't about in-universe technicalities, but of narrative appearances. If Palpatine isn't the real threat, Luke's mastery and Anakin's redemption through Palpatine's defeat at the end of RotJ is made hollow. RotJ's ending is already weakened by TFA, where it is made clear that things didn't go so great for everybody. Further hollowing out the end of that film is pretty counterproductive.\n\n(There is also the not-so-minor point that Pablo *has* said that Snoke isn't Plagueis.)\n\nThis idea is really at a point where it requires some extraordinary justification past \"I think this would be a good idea\".

Saying he's Plagueis in and of itself isn't enough, and that's not at all what I'm suggesting.  \n\nIt just gives us a new perspective on everything that has come before.  And I'm seeing it as a win for both of them.  Palpatine sidelines his master and gets to rule the galaxy.  Plagueis is forced to watch from the shadows for like 50+ years, but he gets to try to correct his apprentice's mistakes.  Palpatine WAS the real threat during the PT and OT.

If they are the same, you must not only introduce Plagueis, you must also dispose of his not being dead. The sequels are already tied to the prequels through the continuity of characters and artifacts.

Now he's back.\"  If they want brownie points, they can officially connect him to the birth of Anakin Skywalker as well.  \n\nIt baffles me that people think this is some sort of complex calculus that the writers would have to do.

After the prequels, I don't want another villain that twirls his mustache only to be taken down by his own arrogance. Maul, Dooku and Grievous all had so much potential but they all ended up being bland, evil-for-evil's-sake bad guys. Even Tarkin, Jabba and Palpatine could arguably fall under this category, though most people (myself included) believe these OG villains were done the more tastefully. Regardless, that's six villains that essentially have the same rise and fall arc: be in position of power, overestimate self, die as a result of hubris. If you count the animated series, there's even more. With Kylo they're doing something different and I really appreciate that. Sure some people prefer their red-lightsaber wielding baddies to be cold hearted badasses but I along with many others welcome the change. \n\n>I don't think you can dispute that he does look emo, and his behavior was emo. \n\nWhat's wrong with that? If you wanted a villain that was badass and not torn apart like Kylo is, that's your preference and unfortunately this trilogy might not be for you. But being \"emo\" isn't an inherently bad thing. The stigma with being emo comes from teenagers being immature and over-dramatic for drama's sake. I think Kylo has a perfectly valid reason for behaving the way he does. If you don't, again that's unfortunate, but his inner conflict between his family and the dark side seems like a valid reason to me for his emotional instability. \n\n>Nobody seemed all that afraid of him in the movie.\n\nThey weren't supposed to. In fact, Hux's sass toward Kylo is blatant and pretty much straight up tells us that, \"This is not Vader.\" Kylo constantly shows the audience how much he thinks he's like Vader (with his costume, mask, music, shuttle, etc) but his behavior and reactions remind us just how far off he is (temper tantrums, pleading to Vader's mask, Hux's sass, etc).\n\nHopefully he will manage to redeem himself to you in the upcoming two movies because I myself believe him to have huge potential as a villain.

I got this in my head for so long until I finally watched the original trilogy on blu ray. The 'only watch the theatricals' attitude kept me from watching Star Wars for years. I finally realized that scouring the internet for a low-end 720p stream wasn't worth it. Then again, I'm a stickler for visual and auditory quality when it comes to watching movies. I prefer to see them in the manner that they were originally intended to be viewed in, meaning the best quality picture and sound available. Ideally that means the theatrical versions, but sadly George Lucas figured he should decide for the fans that his version would only be available to purchase. \n\nThere are very small scenes of unnecessary CG in the remastered editions, basically none in Empire, which is what most consider to be the best in the series. Hardly enough to detract from the story. We're talking filler level scenes of just some creatures standing around on Tattoine in New Hope. A small price to pay for stunning visuals and sound. Those movies had a few cheesy moments already. If those moments aren't enough to ruin the movie, then a few moments of pointless CG aren't going to change that either. \n\nOP has never seen the originals. She didn't grow up with them or see them in theaters, therefore she isn't going to be jaded about the additions Lucas made. ", "id": "d4xsmze"}, {"comment": "I don't think some of the changes like Greedo shooting first are that bad, since Han barely had a character after all (that does not mean I like the change, I dislike it), but there are othet changes that are really that bad.  Jabba in SW ruins the revelation in RotJ, the full Wampa in ESB spoils the tension, the changed lines in the Emperor scene from Empire makes Vader incompetent and stupid, the addition of the scenes of Vader taking a shuttle and going to the Executor ruins the pacing, Vader's NOOOOOO and Anakin's ghost in RotJ are a complete insult to the face, and so on.\n\nThe only reasons why the Special Editions looks much better than the originals (and \"better\" is subjetive:  all the CGI scenes in the battle of Yavin looks like crap)  is because we're stuck with a lousy transfer of a 1990s' standard definition interpositive made for the Laserdisc releases.  Go watch Mike Verta's videos on Vimeo and try to tell me that a proper restoration of the OT (like Verta's Legacy) cannot look great and amazing.  Try to tell me that the stereo mixes on Harmy's Despecialized Editions (which are digital copies of the original theatrical stereo mixes if I'm correct) doesn't sound great.  Anyway, the 2004 1080p masters (which were used for the Blurays)  are terrible.  They used the 1997 negatives (which had digital recompositions made in 2K) and scanned it on 1080p, and added fake grain, among other atrocious things.\n\nI wouldn't mind the existence of the SE if the theatrical versions were available too, and with the proper love and care they should have.  Which is not the case.\n\nAnd BTW, if we're talking about the \"original intention\", then you should limit yourself to either the originals, or a SE without additions.  If you believe some of Lucas' lies (such as puppet/stop motion Jabba in SW, when the original actor was the real deal),  then you're wrong.", "id": "d4xukhb"}, {"comment": "We're on the same page, really. I haven't watched the Despecialized Editions because I never felt like taking the time to download them and transfer them to some media to allow playback on my TV. Sounds silly, I know, because it would be worth the time. As I said, watching Star Wars the way it was originally intended would ideally be the theatrical editions, before Lucas lost his fucking mind.\n\nI guess my point is that it's not entirely feasible to tell OP that she shouldn't waste her time with the SEs, and that she should instead either spend nearly $100 on the original trilogy on DVD, spend time downloading the Despecialized Editions, or stream the theatricals in shitty quality online. For true Star Wars fans, investing some time and money into seeing the *original* originals is a no-brainer, but for someone who has no perspective, she likely won't take it on faith alone that investing said time/money is worth it. \n\nEven though there are certainly pacing issues and many other detracting additions, at least she will be able to see the story, which, as a whole, isn't greatly affected by the changes Lucas made. The character's arcs are the same. The only part of the SEs that takes me out of the story is the addition of dialogue to Vader's change in ROTJ. That part makes me cringe, but passes quickly enough. \n\nPlease don't misunderstand me as a fan. I think Star Wars has proven to be much much better when it's as far out of Lucas' hands as possible. His initial vision was great, but he has NO business as a director or a screenwriter. He never seemed to second guess himself or his ideas and that's why he failed as both (aside from New Hope). Other people did a much better job with the universe he created than he ever could. I still respect and admire the man for creating Star Wars, but despise him almost equally for trying to take it in the wrong direction. I just don't agree that we should apply our own bitterness as fans to introducing the saga to someone who has never properly seen it before. They should watch whatever version they can get their hands on first, and shouldn't spend too much time trying to find whatever everyone else considers to be the 'best' version. That's a lot to lay on a new fan and might even discourage them from picking it up in the first place.

He was angry about Legends being decaonnonized and chose to act in the way he did. I realize this is only one individual, but then I see an article on a group of Legends fans went out of their way to post and blog spoilers out of very much the same reasons.

I'll admit I'm guilty of some jabs about things not being canon, although I'm usually being facetious, but I don't see anything 'deplorable'.\n\nLots of people just aren't going to care about a huge swath of history that 'didn't happen'.

Is it similar so far, sure, but half the movies are similar. RotJ and TPM borrow heavily from ANH, and AotC goes out of its way to call back to Empire. Star Wars has always done that.

Yes, they call back to previous movies, but none of them are outright remakes the way TFA is.", "id": "d95oqif"}, {"comment": "Yeah, but the thing is that TFA is not a remake. It calls back (heavily so) to ANH, and to Empire and Jedi to a far lesser degree. But that's not the point of what it's doing. See, the majority of fans spent years pretty much demanding that if there was another Star Wars film, that it be closer in style to the original trilogy. When Disney gets the rights, they know that if they don't do that, people will be angry. So, in order to appease both sides (those wanting the original trilogy style, and those wanting a new story), they did both \n\nANH is about Luke running toward his destiny. He chooses to do everything that he does in the film. TFA is very different. It's about Rey running away form her destiny, before eventually accepting it, reluctantly so. She fights off the TIE fighters because she has no choice. When she makes it clear she has to go back to Jakku, she is interrupted by Han and Chewie's arrival. When Han offers her a job, she refuses, trying to go back home. When offered Luke/Anakin's lightsaber, she runs away. It isn't until there is no other choice that she chooses to use the force to aid her. \n\nWhen it comes to other similarities, I'm gonna focus on what is easily the biggest issue, and really the only one I get irritated with: Starkiller base. Now, most people say that it's just Death Star III, and I agree. Most people, maybe even all people, don't like that once again, the main goal of a Star Wars movie is to destroy the Death Star. I didn't like it. But then I realized something: in ANH and RotJ, the point is to destroy the Death Star. It is not in TFA, and that's why only side characters are in the air (and yes, Poe is a side character). The point of Starkiller base is to make sure that Han, Finn and Rey all confront Kylo Ren. It is a tool to get the main character arcs completed. Han finally reaches out to his son, Finn stops running away, Kylo gives himself into the Dark Side, and Rey accepts the Force and manages to save her friends (accept Han, but it's too late for him). While yes, the assault on the Death Star led to Luke embracing the force, that is the background: the assault on the Death Star is what's really important in that moment, whereas in TFA, the assault is the background\n\nThe only other similarities are a) BB-8 has essential information, b) the mentor dies, and c) the opening is a beat for beat re-hash of ANH's opening. BB-8 is just a throwback to Artoo. He is literally a way to put Artoo into the story without using Artoo. If anyone has an issue with the mentor dying, then I'm afraid thy should stop watching any fantasy movie ever, cause that's probably gonna happen. With the opening, that is justified, as it sets up what seem like a remake of ANH, which I feel is subverted when the film does NOT remake A New Hope\n\nThis is a very long and drawn out explanation, but my point is that we clearly disagree. You see TFA as a remake, and I do not. I doubt either of us could sway the other's opinion, so it's probably best we end this debate here.

Here, we have a parade of all the old stuff again.  Hey, do you remember X-Wings?  We\u2019ve got a bunch of them!  What about the Death Star?  Now we\u2019ve got a giant Death Star!  And a bigger, blacker Lambda shuttle!  And more lightsabers!  There is almost no new tech in the movie.  \n\nThis is where I begin to disagree. Yes, you're right, there isn't that much new tech in this movie. Look at the circumstances. The New Republic hasn't been fighting any great wars in a few decades. Hell, they've even pretty much demilitarized the entire Republic, cutting down it's military by some 90%. The Resistance is basically the only thing defending the Republic that we know about, and their fleet is so miniscule that they lost basically half of their strength in one battle at Starkiller Base. Why isn't the tech all that new? Because wars spark military technological evolution. Without war, there's no need to really put a lot into new war tech, especially if you're cutting your military by some 90%. It wasn't their focus. The First Order was the one that would evolve their tech, and they were slaves to tradition. They were mirroring the Empire and wouldn't want to change form. \n\n>Han Solo is getting some similar praise, with folks saying that this is the first time Harrison Ford has seemed like he\u2019s enjoying a role in decades.  Were we watching the same movie?  This Han Solo was written by somebody who doesn\u2019t seem to get what makes the character tick.  He\u2019s the rogue with a heart of gold; a trope as old as storytelling to be sure, and one that works, and works very well in the original trilogy, because the character is balanced between two aspects.  The first, and the obvious thing that people notice first, is that confident swagger.  His ship, his booth at the Cantina, marchin\u2019 around the Death Star in a Storm Trooper uniform without a helmet; he doesn\u2019t just occupy his space, he makes it his own, where ever he is.  This is wonderfully tempered by his moments of complete screwball goofiness.  He makes boneheaded mistakes.  His overconfidence gets him into some great slapstick moments (such as when he chases a squad of troopers down a hallway, and after a beat comes running back in a panic with their weapons fire chasing him).  His ego inflates, which brings all eyes on him, and then he does something to deflate it a bit, but in a way that's always endearing rather than disappointing.  The balance between that swagger and the goofiness is critical to the character, and The Force Awakens never sees it.  It has the goofy Han Solo, and seems content to have relegated him entirely to that function in his old age.  There is no hint of the swagger, and as a result, the character is Han Solo in name only.  He\u2019s a goofy old pilot and father figure, a dispenser of exposition and nostalgia, whose death never feels earned, because he never gives the impression that the character we knew was still alive in there at all.\n\nWere you watching the same movie as the rest of us?

Hey, do you remember X-Wings?  We\u2019ve got a bunch of them!  What about the Death Star?  Now we\u2019ve got a giant Death Star!  And a bigger, blacker Lambda shuttle!  And more lightsabers!  There is almost no new tech in the movie.  \n\nThis is where I begin to disagree. Yes, you're right, there isn't that much new tech in this movie. Look at the circumstances. The New Republic hasn't been fighting any great wars in a few decades. Hell, they've even pretty much demilitarized the entire Republic, cutting down it's military by some 90%. The Resistance is basically the only thing defending the Republic that we know about, and their fleet is so miniscule that they lost basically half of their strength in one battle at Starkiller Base. Why isn't the tech all that new? Because wars spark military technological evolution. Without war, there's no need to really put a lot into new war tech, especially if you're cutting your military by some 90%. It wasn't their focus. The First Order was the one that would evolve their tech, and they were slaves to tradition. They were mirroring the Empire and wouldn't want to change form. \n\n>Han Solo is getting some similar praise, with folks saying that this is the first time Harrison Ford has seemed like he\u2019s enjoying a role in decades.  Were we watching the same movie?  This Han Solo was written by somebody who doesn\u2019t seem to get what makes the character tick.  He\u2019s the rogue with a heart of gold; a trope as old as storytelling to be sure, and one that works, and works very well in the original trilogy, because the character is balanced between two aspects.  The first, and the obvious thing that people notice first, is that confident swagger.  His ship, his booth at the Cantina, marchin\u2019 around the Death Star in a Storm Trooper uniform without a helmet; he doesn\u2019t just occupy his space, he makes it his own, where ever he is.  This is wonderfully tempered by his moments of complete screwball goofiness.  He makes boneheaded mistakes.  His overconfidence gets him into some great slapstick moments (such as when he chases a squad of troopers down a hallway, and after a beat comes running back in a panic with their weapons fire chasing him).  His ego inflates, which brings all eyes on him, and then he does something to deflate it a bit, but in a way that's always endearing rather than disappointing.  The balance between that swagger and the goofiness is critical to the character, and The Force Awakens never sees it.  It has the goofy Han Solo, and seems content to have relegated him entirely to that function in his old age.  There is no hint of the swagger, and as a result, the character is Han Solo in name only.  He\u2019s a goofy old pilot and father figure, a dispenser of exposition and nostalgia, whose death never feels earned, because he never gives the impression that the character we knew was still alive in there at all.\n\nWere you watching the same movie as the rest of us?

As such, saying \"here's a good reason why these people realistically wouldn't have new tech\" really isn't a factor in what is a decision of film-making design.  As I said; the original trilogy's joy at always having something new to show, somewhere new to go, that's what made me love Star Wars.

I want to know what your vision of the future of Star Wars should've been.\n\nWell, first off let's take \"should\" out of it.  I'm just talking about what I would have liked to see; I'm not making any judgments about what *should* or *shouldn't* be there.  It's all subjective preference, and as I've pointed out a couple times now, there are enough people who like what the movie did that clearly the filmmakers have met whatever goal they set out to accomplish.  I'm 100% cool with that.\n\nAs for how I would have done it?  First off, I probably wouldn't, for a couple of reasons.  Number one, as a writer, Star Wars isn't the kind of story I find myself telling.  I love it as a viewer, but it's not my own brand of narrative voice.  Beyond that, like I said, I view the story as pretty much perfectly complete.  If put on the spot where it simply must continue, I would probably have further removed it from the original trilogy, allowing the heroes of that conflict to remain comfortably in the fiction's legendary past, and build a new conflict, with wholly new characters, in a setting that functions within the same mythology, but without tying it to the specifics of the original series.  At that point, it's close enough to be a completely different story that it might as well not be Star Wars (hence another reason why I simply wouldn't have done another), but again we're working from a context of \"it must be done.\"", "id": "czmv5nc"}, {"comment": "The only thing left that I disagree with you over is your thought that the Empire was destroyed in ROTJ. No. Even Robot Chicken said it. Killing the leaders and destroying two super weapons doesn't force the entire governing force and it's military to just give up on the spot. The war didn't just end there. It would be illogical to think it does. There is always room to continue the story there. Sure, it didn't have to follow the same characters, but surely Luke's story wasn't over. He went through Jedi training to... What? Lightsaber fight Vader until he got nearly electrocuted to death? And that's it? His story just ends there? No, I don't think so. If anything, the series should've continued with Luke training the New Jedi Order, since they were a noble people that were unjustly destroyed. It should've continued with Luke bringing the Jedi back while the Empire struggles to  regroup. The Empire should be focusing on military might while they lose systems to Rebel influence, and they should be making tools to subjugate systems that are leaving them.

Lightsaber fight Vader until he got nearly electrocuted to death? And that's it? His story just ends there?\n\nI view that somewhat differently than you do, I think.  Luke went through Jedi training not to overcome an enemy in battle, but to overcome the Dark Side of the force.  His fight at the end of Jedi isn't a loss against a stronger, lightning-wielding opponent, it is a victory over the dark side in himself.  He refused to succumb to anger.  He refused to strike back in hatred.  His mastery of the force is so complete that he would take the burden of injury and even death upon himself rather than place that on someone else.  \n\nIt is this personal victory (as opposed to combat victory) that inspires Vader's personal redemption.  In seeing his own son overcome his personal battle with the Dark Side, Vader overcomes the Dark in himself, symbolically taking the burden of sin on his own shoulders with one final act of violence that not only protects those he loves (and the entire galaxy), but also, finally, saving himself.  \n\nBeing the symbol for that is Luke's victory, and it is the culmination of all of his training under a master who boldly proclaims that \"war not make one great,\" and the sign of his own ascent to mastery.

If he wants to torture him why is the fight so short, and why does he not seem to be enjoying it in true evil guy style, with dialogue etc, he just seems to be really angry.  Why doesn't he simply freeze finn before monologuing and then kill him, there has to be some kind of reason? Does he have the saber fight because it's fun, if so why doesn't he look like he's having fun.\n\nThere is a powerlevel question here because the film doesn't really have consistent effects of weapons/power in it. He gets shot with Chewy's bow-caster, is he so strong that he resisted the bolt that was throwing people into the air and taking out handfuls of troops, does he have some kind of force armour or are his robes armoured so that it's only a flesh wound, is he holding his chewed up guts together with the force and that's why he can't freeze. Is his emotional termoil so much that he can't freeze finn or rey if so why is this because don't dark jedi/force users thrive from these emotions and isn't he hitting his wound to draw on them? \n\nI think this came from J.J abrams idea to have thematic parallels in style etc as well as references to the originals that were stripped of their orignal meaning and narrative, or of the character build up or set up. You could see this kind of shallow referencing in both art direction and 'moments' in his two star trek films and was just as confusing.

During the Empire's heyday, the emperor begins developing a clone of Anakin, in case anything happens to Vader. He knows any clones based on Vader will be exceptionally strong in the force and easily brought to the dark side, so it makes sense to make more.\n\nThen the Death Star blows up. Emperor dies, Vader dies. Everyone that knew about the clone is dead. This cloning process is happening on some other planet. A Jedi finds it, somehow, using the force or some shit. They put a stop to it, but this clone of Anakin is an infant. Also female. I have no explanation for that, other than the fact that this Jedi just stopped the cloning process early and maybe that screwed up the genetics. \n\nLuke tries to train the kid, despite the warnings of his peers. (Kind of an echo of Obi-Wan being told not to train Anakin.) Things go badly. Rey has crazy strong force powers. She destroys Luke's Jedi Training Academy. This is the incident that people refer to in the movie. Rey, not Kylo, is the one that turns against Luke. \n\nWell, Luke and his allies defeat her and capture her. Not sure about these next events. Maybe they wipe her memory using the force. They exile her and put her somewhere where they think she'll stay harmless forever and never leave the planet- the planetary junkyard of Jakku.\n\nThis theory explains:\n\n-Why Rey slowly gains abilities without learning them (flying the Falcon, lightsaber battling, mind tricks)\n\n-Why she's on Jakku\n\n-Why Luke's a hermit now (his guilt over training her)\n\nTLDR: Rey is a failed clone of Anakin who has his affinity for the Dark Side.

She doesn't have to be a clone of Anakin or Luke or Leia's daughter to explain her exceptional force sensitivity and inexplicably skill with it before having any training what so ever.

During the Empire's heyday, the emperor begins developing a clone of Anakin, in case anything happens to Vader. He knows any clones based on Vader will be exceptionally strong in the force and easily brought to the dark side, so it makes sense to make more.\n\nThen the Death Star blows up. Emperor dies, Vader dies. Everyone that knew about the clone is dead. This cloning process is happening on some other planet. A Jedi finds it, somehow, using the force or some shit. They put a stop to it, but this clone of Anakin is an infant. Also female. I have no explanation for that, other than the fact that this Jedi just stopped the cloning process early and maybe that screwed up the genetics. \n\nLuke tries to train the kid, despite the warnings of his peers. (Kind of an echo of Obi-Wan being told not to train Anakin.) Things go badly. Rey has crazy strong force powers. She destroys Luke's Jedi Training Academy. This is the incident that people refer to in the movie. Rey, not Kylo, is the one that turns against Luke. \n\nWell, Luke and his allies defeat her and capture her. Not sure about these next events. Maybe they wipe her memory using the force. They exile her and put her somewhere where they think she'll stay harmless forever and never leave the planet- the planetary junkyard of Jakku.\n\nThis theory explains:\n\n-Why Rey slowly gains abilities without learning them (flying the Falcon, lightsaber battling, mind tricks)\n\n-Why she's on Jakku\n\n-Why Luke's a hermit now (his guilt over training her)\n\nTLDR: Rey is a failed clone of Anakin who has his affinity for the Dark Side.

The characters in ANH all fit certain archetypes, and in that regard you are correct in them being 'flat', however they all behave consistently with themselves, and thus don't really require 'development' over the course of the film, because they mostly remain 'static'. The only exception to this is Han, who we first meet as a sort of loner (with the exception of Chewie) and a non-believer who doesn't really care much about anyone or anything except himself and his ship (and Chewie). Over the course of the film we see him gradually develop a friendship and appreciation for Luke, and an apparent sexual tension with Leia. By the time of the scene on Yavin where he tries to convince Luke to join him as a smuggler, and Luke tries to convince Han to join him as a Rebel, we see a very apparent conflict within Han, evidenced by his hesitation and uncertainty whilst speaking to Luke - even going so far to say \"may the Force be with you\" to him, after earlier professing a disbelief in the Force. Chewie even calls him out on his apparent change of attitude. His ultimate 'change of heart' moment when he decides to change his course of action occurs off-screen, but thats okay because the groundwork for it was properly laid on-screen just prior.\n\nContrast this to TFA, specifically Finn and Rey, who both pull an extreme 180 in terms of their outlook and attitude over the course of the film. Finn is determined to get as far away from the First Order as humanly possible and as fast as possible for the first half of the film, he tries talking others into going with him, which they rebuke, and hes all 'okay, later homie'. Then, a few moments later he witnesses a planet blow up and gets caught up in a First Order surprise attack, and suddenly all of his instinctual desire of self-preservation is gone and hes ready to be a hero. There is an attempted buildup to this prior, we see him and Rey, and him and Han, develop a sort of loose friendship earlier in the film, but there isn't enough time allowed for the characters to interact properly for this sudden change to feel truly believable, nor is there that 'moment of hesitation on Yavin' that shows him having a true change of heart to make his transition, when it comes, seem like a realistic and logical extension of what came prior.\n\nRey is a somewhat similar case. She spends the entirety of the first half of the film being fairly committed to staying on Jakku, and when she is forced to leave Jakku her sole desire is to return. The rest of the characters spend half the film trying to convince her otherwise, which she continuously and adamantly rejects. Then, suddenly, she gets kidnapped and suddenly starts using the force better than most Jedi Knights, and she suddenly decides that there is no going back and that everyone else has been right the whole time, that nobody is coming to get her. Again, there is no real buildup to this, its a whole lotta 'nope nope nope not listening' followed by 'yknow, you were right'.  \n\nIts important to note this is heavily contrasted with Luke who is essentially the opposite. His desire is to get the hell off of Tatooine, when the opportunity first comes he has his 'rejection of the hero's call' moment, the same as Rey (with a key difference being that Rey spends the entire first half of the movie rejecting it) where he believably responds out of uncertainty and fear that he has to stay to help his family. When his family gets bumped off and theres nothing left for him on Tatooine, he commits to leaving - this is believable, its what he originally wanted in the first place, and his only excuse not to was removed from the picture leaving him no other real choice.

It allows everyone to go into a fresh new world that (so far) is much more cohesive (but it's early days).

Probably. I can see the KOTOR arcs coming back in the form that we are familiar with (we already got Malachor). For obvious reasons, I can't see the return of Ben or Jaina.

The event of TPM happens as usual. The only thing that would change is Aunt Beru, she would be the blood sister of Anakin Skywalker. \n\nEpisode 2 comes along, Anakin has nightmares about his mother's death, becomes obsessed, goes to find her only for her to die in his hand. The twist is that Aunt Beru have been trying to contact Anakin at the Jedi Council for several weeks. It was an emergency and she needs Anakin and the jedi's help to save their mother. The Jedi kept the message a secret because it would only distract Anakin from his duty and because Jedi are not suppose to have attachments to their family and emotions. Congratulation, now Anakin has a reason to hate the Jedi Order. He is seething with anger and resentment, doubts and distrusts against the Jedi. He acts more brash and harsh after losing his mother, reflecting Vader's behaviors, of who he is going to become.  \n\nMeanwhile the clone war happens between the mandalorians and the Republic. The Mandalorians uses clone armies to support their feeble, small numbers of organization. They earn supports/ cohert other systems to support their causes to fight the republic's meddling affair.  the Republic build an army, militarized, armed themselves to prepare for looming dangers. Darth Maul has been mutilated by Obi Wan in TPM, he escaped, has lost his title as a sith lord, seeks revenge, taken under Dooku's command while Dooku abide to Sidious's plans. \n\n\nEpisode 3 - Anakin is a harsh, military general now. The war and death keeps him weary. He grows more impatient as the war continues on. He is looking to end the war now and he will take short cuts to do it, even if it means using the dark side of the force to do it. Palpatine instructs him to outright murder the seperatists/ Mandalorian leaders while the seperatists have been instructed by Palpatine/ Sidious to negotiate a treaty with the Republic. This is Palpatine's ploy to pull Anakin toward the Dark side of the force, enabling him to be alienated by the Jedi Order for murdering unarmed military leaders who surrended for negotiations. Meanwhile Anakin is bothered by a vision of his wife, Padme's death. He increasingly becomes obsessed with saving her. He learn there are knowledge of cheating death , kept hidden deep in the Jedi Archieve, that even the high council members do not have access to. This apparent hidden knowledge fuels Anakin's frustrations and poor judgement. Meanwhile Palpatine is willing to teach him the ways of cheating death, he further tempts Anakin. At this point Anakin learns of the seperatists/ mandalorian leaders and murdered them as to end the war quickly without negotiations, the Jedi learns of his horrifying, uncivilized deeds, expel him from the Jedi order. Anakin is pissed off, feels betrayed, hurts, left out, alone. Obi Wan is his only friend, but Obi wan is also obligated to follow the Jedi code. Vunerable, Anakin is seduced by Palpatine's father figure. Palpatine confines in Anakin that he believes the Jedi are conspiring to take over the Republic, because why else would they expel a powerful Jedi in which the prophecy said would bring balance to the force? how can it be? It is outragoues for the Jedi to do this. Palpatine provokes the Jedi to attack him at a vunerable moment, staged everything to make the Jedi looks bad, presents the evidences to the Republic Senate that the Jedi are attempting to take the Republic by force. The Senates believe this except for the fews who knows Palpatine is growing too powerful. Palpatine and Anakin mount an attack on the Jedi Temple. Bloodsheds ensue, a deadly massacre. The Republic Storm troopers are now hunting down the rest of the Jedi through out the galaxy, stationed at planets and star systems during the war and afterward. Obi Wan learns the horrible truth through the holo recording that he and Yoda has seen, and Padme learn the horrible truth as well. She and Obi Wan conspired together to try and save what is left of Anakin. Padme will try to convince Anakin to leave everything behind, she will also try to assassinate him if it has to come to it. Anakin is heading to the volcanoes world of Sullust with a squadron of troopers to hunt down Mace Windu after he has learned that Windu had killed all the troops at a republican military outpost  on Sullust and is on the lam. All ships are on lockdown and Windu cannot escape. Anakin is on the hunt for Windu, he is also on a personal vendetta because it is Windu that expelled Anakin from the Jedi Order, it is Windu that had it in for Anakin from the first day Anakin stepped into the Jedi council as a kid. He must prove himself, his ego begs him to kill Windu. By now Obi Wan is one of the very few Jedi left standing, Windu contacts Obi Wan for help, knowing his ability to get out of a difficult situation all the times. Padme goes with Obi wan to help him and to hope she'll confront Anakin. Meanwhile Yoda agrees to confront Palpatine in the biggest showdown. This is his one chance to take down the Emperor. Yoda confronts Palpatine at the Senate building after the emergency session for a reformation of the Republic into the Empire. They don't duel, they use the force to throw things at each others. Palpatine a far more powerful force user, levels the whole Senate arena to throw at Yoda. Yoda also a far more powerful force user, repels all attacks from Palpatine as well as reflect lightenining attacks which eventually worn him down and injured him. Yoda escapes.\n\nObi Wan and Padme arrives on Sullust, they track down Windu only to learn Windu is dead. Padme finds Anakin not too far ahead, she confronts him. She begs him to just come back home, leave everything behind while they still can. He is obsessed with power, he must save Padme from death. He has given everything up just for her. He will kill the Emperor, he will rule the galaxy as husband and wife. Padme is distraught, it is true, all of it. Anakin is far beyond being saved, he is fully consumed by the dark side of the force, he is not the person he once was. For the republic, for everything, for herself and her unborn children, standing close to Anakin, Padme pull out a dagger and stabs him in the chest. The wound does not faze him, but her betrayal shocked him, hurts him more than the dagger could. He grabs for her throat and squeezed her with a death graps. Obi Wan comes around into view, he yells at Anakin to let her go. Distraughted, fueled with hate and anger, Anakin is angry at Obi wan for turning Padme against her husband. They argue back and forth, Anakin will destroy Obi Wan. Anakin is for the Empire, for peace. They begin to duel. They do not flip around like Power Rangers, there is no music, it is only silence. The only noise are from Obi Wan, Anakin, their sabers and their environment, this is the big moment. They duel  slowly with deliberation, every blow has a purpose, a weight. They move from the military base and into the outdoor , volcanoes, steam riddiance, hazarous environment. Anakin grows more restless and impatient with Obi Wan as they draw closer and closer to a seemingly inactive giant crater. In the midst of the fight a steam vent blew through between Anakin and Obi Wan, but Anakin is more badly burned than Obi Wan did, he is distracted by his partially melted skin. Obi Wan goes for the kill, his dismembered Anakin's legs and arm, Anakin quickly toppled into the slope of the crater. A hole has opened up, lava spews out, pooling the crater. Anakin slowly slides near the lava, catching on fire, badly injured by his burn. Obi wan is upset, does his whole speech about being brothers, love, chosen one. Obi Wan assumes Anakin will die because the crater is opening up. He will die in his misery. Obi Wan leaves to take care of Padme. Cue end of ROTS;  Yoda is communicating with the ghost of Qui Gon Jinn about being a ghost. Padme has the twins, she dies of medical complications.  Palpatine rescues Anakin, rebuild him back on Coruscant. Vader learns of Padme's death, Palpatine pins the blame on Vader's reckless behavior, reminds him to keep his ego in check if he is to survive. Vader has one last burst of outrage, tears apart the medical room, bangs his fists on the operating table, screaming in agony and then utter silence, he puts his head down and accepts his fate.  Padme's funeral at Alderaan, Vader walks on the star destroyer bridge, the twins given up for adoption, we see binary sunset, credit rolls, but no fanfare music. Just absolute silent to convey a tragedy.\n\n\nOther things to change :  Orn Free Taa the fat ass blue twilek that stood by Palpatine, make him Grand Moff Tarkin. \n\nAnakin kills Dooku for being amputated. He also kills Maul for revenge against Qui Gon Jinn. Obi Wan was seperated/ unconsciouse throughout the duel. \n\nJango Fett is the clone template\n\nThe Phantom Menace starts off with trade dispute, to give the federation an excuse to go to war and have the backing of the mandalorines and Seperatist movement. \n\n\nAnakin and Beru lives with their mother as slaves. Beru and Shmi are brought and freed by the Lars family later on. \n\nOwen has resentments against the Jedi because they would not help Anakin's mother. Hence his lack of interest in Obi Wan in ANH.

I don't think the \"new\" fans (the ones that you could reach at least) needed anything more than the hype of the old fans and the growing popularity of SW to go to the theater, so I can't figure out where the ANH plot fits in any manner.  JJ's \"secret box\" or whatever assured none of us knew the plot anyway^1 so doing a reboot, no matter how soft, just doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nMy favorite part of the movie was the characters and they could have been introduced the exact same with a completely different plot.  I *really* love the first hour or so of this film, but the last hour feels like the OT on fast forward, and I personally can't stand it nor understand the supposed \"need\" for it.  There are stories in this universe that I know will eventually be told out of necessity, like the fall of Ben and the rise of the First Order, and I feel like those would have made a much cooler movie than what we got in TFA.\n\nI have high hopes for episode VIII because people say it's different and new, and we're finally going to get Luke motherfucking Skywalker back in a film for more than ten seconds.  I feel that Ep. 8's reception, good or bad, will make people revisit TFA and re-assess the necessity of the \"soft reboot\" aspect of it.  If Ep. VIII blows people away I think there will be more people questioning why TFA wasn't a more original idea.  I understand that the saga movies need to feel similar, but a third planet killing superweapon was honestly a terrible call when many people thought the second Death Star was repetitive and \"lazy\".  Rogue One, on the other hand, is made to be different and not a saga film, so I personally can't wait.

It never went anywhere. \n\n\nI mostly just think the story is bad, and characters actions and motivations were poorly written.

I mean I was a kid who was 9 when Revenge of the Sith came out. I remembered seeing it in theaters, but it was so long ago. This was my first real memorable Star Wars theater experience. \n\nAs an avid fan of the EU I was just kind of disappointed where they took this story. And don't give me this BS that they needed to \"get people on board after the prequels\" Its fucking star wars, its gonna sell tickets.\n\nThere was just so many different ways they could have taken a trilogy set 30 years after the OT and we just got a rehash of IV. New Death Star was kind of stupid, and people need to stop trying to defend it by saying how it was practical for the First Order to build it. Yeah ok sure, maybe. But I don't watch Star Wars for practicality. When your movie franchise has 7 Episodes and 3 of them have revolved around the same exact weapon I just think that's poor writing. The second death star in ROTJ made sense. If the fucking Ewoks hadn't shown up then the rebel fleet would have been annihilated. Starkiller base was just kind of built just because. And I know they said the First Order retreated into territory far from the New Republic but there's just no fucking way they couldn't have known they were hollowing out a planet that could suck in suns energies to fire a laser across hyperspace. Do you realize the amount of manpower and materials they'd need for that? Was the New Republic so fucking incompetent that they didn't bother having any fucking intelligence in First Order territory? It doesn't have to be a special agent. It could just be some random dude who delivered some supplies or something. \n\nI also didn't really like what they did with Luke in all honesty. I'm gonna wait until Episode 8 to make my full judgement on that but I really don't like the fact that Luke has essentially abandoned the galaxy for years. This is the Luke who abandoned his jedi training to help his friends. \n\nI just find it hard to believe that he would just sit on the sidelines as his sister and best friends are embroiled in a conflict with the reincarnation of the Empire. Hopefully they can come up with a valid reason for him leaving besides \"hurr durr he was sad because his jedi order was destroyed\" \n\nChewie not hugging Leia has been beat to death on this sub so I won't even discuss it further. The insistence on basically using no old alien species besides famous characters such as ackbar. \n\nI mean so this New Republic isn't even governed by any of the species that fought to establish it besides humans? The Starkiller scene showing the destruction of Hosnian Prime just shows a bunch of humans and new aliens being killed. None of the OT species basically if I'm remembering correctly. \n\nAgain for this I'm gonna wait until Episode 8 but they really need to do a good job of explaining how Snoke was able to swoop in and take control of the First Order. How did Palpatine not sense this ultra powerful force sensitive during either the clone wars or the OT or the time in between? Why do the First Order even follow him besides him being snidely whiplash levels of evil?\n\nI understand this turned into a rant of what I find wrong with the film but whatever."], [1, "Yep"], [1, "Do you mean the reuse of ANH's plot?

It does not matter how one feels about how they were directed , casted, or produced. Star Wars now has 7 episodes and they will continue to make more.

The bad guys will always try to make some weapon in that form to kill billions of people in an instant.  2. People will always use droids to stow away secret information. Droids do not count as lifeforms although they are self aware. This makes them self preservere, and at the same time, they can lie and the force can not be used to pick their droid brains of any type of knowlege they may be carrying. Droids are even used for this even in the extended Star Wars universe. \n3. Smuggling will always play important plot roles in Star Wars. When you have an evil eye that sees all, you need underground networks that can move people undetected. These cantinas are where smugglers meet. Politicians and military forces don't even want to go there because that are where scum hangs out. Its no wonder at all that Solo is close with Maz and her temple. Solo and other smugglers use these these places as a way of networking and moving around undedected by the Empire or First Order.\n4. Special people come from sand planets because that is the best place to hide them. Think of hiding somebody on Tattoine or Jaku like hiding information on a droid. These are planets that don't talk. One is a salvage planet while the other acts as a large gambling hall owned by the huts. No one would think to check these places as hideouts. So, those are the main similarities I see with TFA and the rest of the episodes. The reason why everything feels so similar is because it is a Star Wars story.

Obi Wan fights Darth Vader cause they have some unfinished business, Han is trying to save his son. Vader kills Obi Wan but it's mostly a \"AHA!

They should have stuck with the first planet they had her on, it was a giant junk planet like Raxus Prime.

They didn't need cyborg jawas either. If you want to make some scavengers they don't have to be diminutive and have brown robes. What they did with the new star destroyer making it have the classic wedge shape but its still new is what they should have done with the starfighters. If you watch the prequels you can see how the ARC-170 starfighter is a predecessor to the X-Wing because it had the long and narrow body and the s-foils. Then you see the V-Wings that literally use twin ion engines so they sound like TIE fighters and there wings fold up when in flight mode like a TIE fighter so we know it's the predecessor. So when they made TFA they should have made a new ship that is similar to the X-Wing and has s-foils, but not a literally copy with minor exterior detail changes and when they made the TIE fighters they should have gave them a different wing configuration instead of a copy from the OT. Like after all those EU TIE fighters it would have been really cool if the First Order used a TIE fighter that looked like the TIE Defender or something.

JJ's \"secret box\" or whatever assured none of us knew the plot anyway^1 so doing a reboot, no matter how soft, just doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nMy favorite part of the movie was the characters and they could have been introduced the exact same with a completely different plot.  I *really* love the first hour or so of this film, but the last hour feels like the OT on fast forward, and I personally can't stand it nor understand the supposed \"need\" for it.

I feel that Ep. 8's reception, good or bad, will make people revisit TFA and re-assess the necessity of the \"soft reboot\" aspect of it.  If Ep. VIII blows people away I think there will be more people questioning why TFA wasn't a more original idea.  I understand that the saga movies need to feel similar, but a third planet killing superweapon was honestly a terrible call when many people thought the second Death Star was repetitive and \"lazy\".  Rogue One, on the other hand, is made to be different and not a saga film, so I personally can't wait.

It changed a little bit since then, which did get rid of a lot of the parts I though were dumb, but not all of them.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: I didn't really like it nor did I understand the supposed \"need\" for a soft reboot.

And don't give me this BS that they needed to \"get people on board after the prequels\" Its fucking star wars, its gonna sell tickets.\n\nThere was just so many different ways they could have taken a trilogy set 30 years after the OT and we just got a rehash of IV. New Death Star was kind of stupid, and people need to stop trying to defend it by saying how it was practical for the First Order to build it. Yeah ok sure, maybe. But I don't watch Star Wars for practicality. When your movie franchise has 7 Episodes and 3 of them have revolved around the same exact weapon I just think that's poor writing. The second death star in ROTJ made sense. If the fucking Ewoks hadn't shown up then the rebel fleet would have been annihilated. Starkiller base was just kind of built just because. And I know they said the First Order retreated into territory far from the New Republic but there's just no fucking way they couldn't have known they were hollowing out a planet that could suck in suns energies to fire a laser across hyperspace. Do you realize the amount of manpower and materials they'd need for that? Was the New Republic so fucking incompetent that they didn't bother having any fucking intelligence in First Order territory? It doesn't have to be a special agent. It could just be some random dude who delivered some supplies or something. \n\nI also didn't really like what they did with Luke in all honesty. I'm gonna wait until Episode 8 to make my full judgement on that but I really don't like the fact that Luke has essentially abandoned the galaxy for years. This is the Luke who abandoned his jedi training to help his friends. \n\nI just find it hard to believe that he would just sit on the sidelines as his sister and best friends are embroiled in a conflict with the reincarnation of the Empire. Hopefully they can come up with a valid reason for him leaving besides \"hurr durr he was sad because his jedi order was destroyed\" \n\nChewie not hugging Leia has been beat to death on this sub so I won't even discuss it further. The insistence on basically using no old alien species besides famous characters such as ackbar. \n\nI mean so this New Republic isn't even governed by any of the species that fought to establish it besides humans? The Starkiller scene showing the destruction of Hosnian Prime just shows a bunch of humans and new aliens being killed. None of the OT species basically if I'm remembering correctly. \n\nAgain for this I'm gonna wait until Episode 8 but they really need to do a good job of explaining how Snoke was able to swoop in and take control of the First Order. How did Palpatine not sense this ultra powerful force sensitive during either the clone wars or the OT or the time in between? Why do the First Order even follow him besides him being snidely whiplash levels of evil?\n\nI understand this turned into a rant of what I find wrong with the film but whatever.", "id": "d39pvty"}, {"comment": "Don't forget the fact that the Jedi have disappeared/been killed.

This tells us something about how this Galactic Empire is managed, what its governing body is. Darth Vader calls her a member of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. So this band of freedom fighters we're told about in the opening crawl are not an official government, they're revolutionaries (backed up when Han says he's \"not in it for your revoltion\"), just in case the name '*Rebel* Alliance' wasn't enough.\n\nLater, Grand Moff Tarkin announced the Emperor has dissolved the Senate. Immediately, that tells us why this Empire is bad. The Emperor has just removed whatever democratic process was left and assumed more power to himself. Even if you're not really aware of the line, subconsciously you'll start connecting that to things you've heard about the Roman Emperors. Dissolving a voting body for absolute power is a bad thing. \n\nThe dialogue that follows is all about regional governors (of which Tarkin is one, pointed out when Leia refers to him as Governor Tarkin) tightening their grip with direct control over territories, using fear to keep the populace in line - fear of the Death Star. This further paints the Empire as bad guys *and* explains why they built the Death Star in the first place.\n\nAll very innocuous, and even brief dialogue but it's really important for understanding the context of the story. So the Empire is in charge and they're bad guys, and the Rebels are freedom fighters waging a guerrilla war to free the galaxy. Context. \n\nTFA lacks all of this. 'The Republic' is only mentioned in the film itself seconds before and then after 'it' is destroyed. Apparently alongside their whole fleet? The movie neither shows nor explains this. It doesn't explain what planets were destroyed, it doesn't bother explaining how Starkiller base is in relation to the system it destroys, nor how it is capable of firing at this system from wherever it is (barring a vague reference that it might be through hyperspace - though this certainly isn't shown).\n\nThere's a Resistance, but no real indication of where they came from ('Leia set them up') is all the film gives us, or even what they're resisting. Are the First Order actively attacking places? Why isn't the Republic doing anything?\n\nAnd while the visual connection to the Empire is obvious, the film never bothers to explain where the First Order really came from, where they're based, how big they are or even really what they're trying to do. Presumably take control of the galaxy again, but it's left pretty nebulous. \n\nUnanswered questions going forward is fine, but you have to explain at least a few things that are needed context to make all the things the characters are doing make sense.

What I meant was quite literal. Where are they from in the galaxy in relation to the Republic? Are they operating from hidden bases like the Alliance in ANH? Do they still have territory? Where? How much?\n\nYou maybe don't need answers to all these questions, no. But I felt like TFA needed *something*. Unlike ANH, which gets away with being a little vague on details like this because it's introducing a brand new universe, TFA struggles because it neglects context not only around its own story but on actual specifics on how the galaxy we know from where the story left off in RotJ has changed. Or not as the case may be.\n\n>and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.\n\nSo why blow up 'the Republic'? Is the Resistance's whole function to protect Luke Skywalker then, or did they form to stop whatever else the First Order are up to that we're not being told about?   \n\nI know I'm being overly literal here, and I know that saving some things for future problems isn't a problem at all, but this is the easiest way I have to illustrate that TFA lacks a certain cohesiveness. \n\nLook, I really enjoyed the film too. I love the new characters, I love the aesthetic and I love the passion for Star Wars you can feel in it. But I can't shake the feeling that *something* doesn't quite click for me.

I have no invested interest in any of them. They are all boring, one dimensional, and illogical. There was a lot of potential there (for some of them anyway), but the film failed to deliver anything more than a hint of this because it took no time to breathe and give any of the necessary exposition needed. Beyond that, the character \"development\" is stunted and disjointed. Characters begin acting an dbehaving in ways that are contrary to their behaviors established earlier in the film.\n\nPoe - The only real bright spot in the entire film, character-wise. He has an interesting personality, his behavior and mannerisms stay consistent throughout. Only real problem is that thereis no real character development to speak of, because the film doesn't spend much time with him, and most of it is focused on him being an action hero. \n\nKylo Ren - He's a whiny teenager. What? You mean he's supposed to be almost 30? Talk about immature. I think he's overdue for a nice long stand in the corner while he thinks about what hes done. Seriously, is he supposed to be scary or intimidating? Because he is neither, the only thing he might be is pitiful. Oh and look, what a clever visual metaphor of having his lightsaber be as unstable as he is mentally. SO. CLEVER. Theres no character development whatsoever, hes just a frightened child with a massive inferiority complex, probably because he was bullied by the other kids at school for being such a little bitch. The film goes to great lengths to try to make him seem powerful, but nothing shown really screams \"POWER\". He pulls someone across a room into his outstretched arm so he can strangle them... Vader would have just strangled them from the other end of the room with his mind (besides the fact that we've seen force sensitive types move much larger objects than a person in previous films). He straps his victims into a BDSM torture chair so he can probe their minds... every other jedi (and sith) we've seen in previous films can just read someones thoughts by looking at them. He pauses a blaster bolt in mid-air... okay that one is kind of cool, but I'm not sure it requires any more skill than baseballing away blaster shots with a lightsaber or catching a blaster bolt (Vader, ESB) or Force Lightning (Yoda, RotS) with your hand. Again, no real character development to speak of here. \n\nFinn - So many things wrong here. I *wanted* to like Finn, I think he still has potential, but I think they made a few missteps with his portrayal. Alright, he starts out as a Stormtrooper, raised to be one of the First Orders elite soldiers ever since he was but a wee child... apparently they didn't do a good job because he spends the first half of the film acting like a gutless coward. I get his desire to escape the First Order, I have no issues with that, but he completely lacks any sort of military bearing or composure in his characterization. How, exactly, did he make it through training with such a weak constitution and lack of discipline and mental fortitude? The canon novels assure us that he was, in fact, the top of his class at the academy and considered the model stormtrooper by his peers and superiors, and that he performed admirably and heroically during training (and was even commended for his ruthless lethality during training missions). Even after his not entirely believable and seemingly sudden change of heart he doesn't really personify his backstory in any way, shape, or form and acts more like a clueless amateur than anything else. The only time I really felt his character fit the backstory was towards the end when he challenged Kylo Ren. Also, wtf is an elite combat infantrymen doing working \"Sanitation\"? I mean, at first I was kinda blown away, thinking \"sanitation\" was a metaphor for something much more nefarious, but no, it turned out they literally meant housekeeping/sewage processing. At least Finn had some character development over the course of the film, I suppose.\n\nPhasma - *yawn* It was a conscious effort to artificially create the \"Boba Fett effect\" and backfired miserably. For all the hype she received, we were only treated to what, maybe a minute of screentime? Yeah, she looks kinda cool I guess, she would have potential in future if they didn't completely kill it in its infantile cradle by having her instantly cave in to her captors the moment they pointed the gun at her head, and then unceremoniously throw her down a trash chute. Boba Fett might not have done much on screen, but at least he seemed to be competent and menacing for most of 2 films (up until the point that he accidentally gets tossed in the Sarlacc pit because a blind Han bumps into his rocket pack - a scene commonly considered to be amongst the worst in the entire OT). No character development to speak of, no real personality that can be identified from her brief appearances on screen.\n\nHux - If he had a middle name it would be \"babyface\". Seems a bit young to be the head of the First Orders military, but whatever. Hes Tarkin with a bit more Hitler in him. Nothing special, a tired old trope that we've seen plenty enough of already. No real character development to speak of, his personality is entirely one dimensional. He served a purpose in the film, and he served it well, but there is no real attachment to be felt, or reason to feel attachment, to this character.\n\nSnoke - The Wizard of Oz meets Gollum. Another character who doesn't really get much screen time and doesn't really have any character development or personality beyond \"shadowy and mysterious villain puppetmaster\". The only real interest and intrigue that exists with Snoke is finding out his backstory. Really, hes not an interesting character at all, the only reason why hes even discussed is because the conviction that the fanbase has that he *must* be a character we have previously encountered. Really to me it feels like most Star Wars fans were snookered in by one of the oldest tricks in the book for creating the illusion of depth where there otherwise is none: leave things a mysterious so that everyone focuses on trying to figure out whats behind the curtain.\n\nBB-8 - Okay, I actually liked BB-8, can't talk smack about the little guy.\n\nRey - The only character in the group that feels fully three dimensional and fleshed out. Sadly, I just didn't like her character. Shes kind of an unlikable and unsympathetic character from the get go in my opinion, particularly with her regards towards BB-8 and her conviction to remain a miserable sad-sack on a largely inhospitable rock waiting for people that she doesn't even really know (I mean it would be one thing if she could at least remember what they looked like, or had an actual reason to believe that they would return). Thankfully she does have some character development and begins to become more of a sympathetic character in time, but that development seems somewhat rushed and slightly disjointed at times. I'm not about to complain about her being a mary sue, but in many ways she does suffer from a general absence of character flaws, particularly once the main apparent flaw (her desire to remain on Jakku) is largely resolved early on, and more forcefully resolved for her by later events. She is, at this point in the trilogy, essentially a one woman show, in that most (if not all) plot development for the film (and seemingly the trilogy) centers and revolves around her, and in fact she serves as the crux of this plot development, either willfully (she is more or less singularly responsible for the vast majority of the 'conflict resolution' needed to drive forward the plot, such as piloting the Falcon to evade the First Order, freeing herself from captivity, etc.) or incidentally (the lightsaber subplot, being captured and taken to Starkiller Base which - coincidentally enough - needed to be destroyed anyway, so might as well do that in the process of rescuing her, etc.). One could go so far as to say that she is almost a Deus ex Machina in and of herself, given her characters tendency to spontaneously develop the skills and abilities needed to resolve any challenges encountered, and this is where the \"mary sue\" complaint comes from, even if the people making those claims aren't really consciously aware of what the problem is - the issue is not that she is \"overpowered\" or \"too perfect\" or \"over-idealized\", the issue is that shes kind of just lazily written.

Agreed.\n\n> They tried to make the Alderaan planet have impact but we've never seen it before so that's terrible writing. They should have had at least a scene showing it.\n\nUhh they show the impact of Alderaan's destruction through Leia. It's her homeworld and (presumably) all of her family and friends are on the planet when it explodes.\n\n> They just blew up Luke just happens to come across the same droid that has a message for his dad's friend. What a coincidence.\n\nIt's not really a coincidence at all? Obi Wan is on Tatooine purposefully watching over Luke. It makes sense that if the droids are looking for Kenobi, they might run into Luke. Yes, we find out the connection later, but that doesn't really make it a coincidence.\n\n> They don't tell you anything about Luke's dad, they just treat it like an afterthought.\n\nVague =/= afterthought. \n\n> Darth Vader is supposed to be badass but let's old men talk down to him, so clearly they're not afraid of him.\n\nThey talk down to him and Darth Vader immediately responds by fucking choking one with the force that they were just mocking. Badass confirmed.\n\n> Luke somehow becomes a crack shot with a rifle and kills a bunch of trained stormtroopers while they are saving leia. Then while they're running away, Luke somehow grapples this tiny little pipe and swings across a chasm one handed while carrying leia ? He's had all of 5 minutes of force pep talk.\n\nLuke grew up on the frontier surrounded by Tusken Raiders. It's doubtful this is the first time Luke has fired a blaster. This is not at all analogous to Rey just knowing how to use a mind trick with zero training at all.\n\n> Now they've escaped and they're going back to that base, obi wan sacrificed himself and I don't see why Vader didn't just kill the rest of them. It's not like he can't get through a door.\n\nThe blast door was closed after the door trigger was shot. We've seen before in TPM how long it takes to cut through a blast door. Vader could not have cut through it quick enough to stop the Rebels. Just stop dude.\n\n> Now they're back at the base and they're going to let Luke be a pilot to attack the Death Star. He's never done anything like that except fly some non-combat situation on tattooine. That's like comparing flying a small plane at your local airport and being in a fighter jet In battle.\n\nThey're in a desperate do or die fight. They have a guy who just rescued one of their top leaders from the Death Star and a current Rebel pilot vouches for his flying ability.\n\n> Why does the empire have such few people defending It? They can kill like 15 x wings?\n\nThe Empire/Tarkin are shown to be arrogant and believe their Death Star is an impenetrable fortress and the \"ultimate power\" in the galaxy. This isn't even subtext dude. It is literally the text of the movie.\n\n> Vader just got taken out super easily and Luke turned off his computer and was able to use the force to make his missile do a 90 degree turn and perfectly hit the spot that needed to be destroyed on the Death Star. Again, after 5 min of \"training\" and a pep talk.\n\nVader was clipped by his wingmate flying into him, not something easily prevented. Luke at least had some training from Obi Wan on the trip to Alderaan. He is shown to improve in his command of the force under the tutelage of a Jedi Master. The length of that trip is vague.

It gives ANH an epic scope in its storytelling and visuals.\n\nMy favorite choice JJ Abrams made in this movie was [Spoilers] ( /s \"the way the Han Solo's confrontation with Kylo Ren was written and shot. It's been mentioned various times that this scene mirrors the deaths of mentors Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon in the previous trilogies. However, there was the long shot of Han Solo and Kylo Ren that reminded me of the platform Luke and Vader fought in TESB, with both pairs having a filial relationship.

Not only that, other franchises are repetitive as well.\n\nFor instance, all 007 movies have essentially the same plot and plot elements, just with Bond girls and Bond villains. All these Bond movies involve James Bond foiling a villain's evil plan. There are a gun barrel sequence, pre-title sequences(starting with *From Russia With Love*), title sequences, flirting with Moneypenny, receiving assignments from M, technical briefings with Q, and gadgets in every Bond movie. There is a Wikipedia page dedicated to this list of motifs. Yet nobody has ever called any 007 film a rip-off of a previous film. Nobody bats an eye when 007 repeats itself constantly, yet everybody goes mad when Star Wars does the same thing.\n\nDespite the repetition, people still watch and enjoy 007 films. There are some great ones and some terrible ones, despite essentially being the same movie. Why is that? It's about how the production executes the formula. If there is a motif done poorly (i.e. Bond villain), then that will be noticeable by the audience.

ANH starts slowly as you say, and then the main protagonist doesn't even meet the villain until the end of the second movie, at which point he gets his butt kicked.\n\nTFA is completely different in that the protagonist is already beating the villain half way through the first movie (Rey blocks Kylo's mind probe and even counterattacks).

Droid carries data important to the struggling good guy anti-fascist group, [spoilers](/s \"father figure killed by villain\"), giant planet sized super weapon...

Based on which movies are beloved by fans, I think a lot of people want that story telling. For example, the prequels had tons of spectacle, but everyone hated them.\n\n*The Empire Strikes Back* is often called the fan favorite and it only has three action scenes: the Battle of Hoth, the asteroid field chase, and the Luke-Vader showdown. These action scenes serve the story arc, which is the despair of the rebellion, Leia and Han's search for peace and shelter, and Luke's failure as an aspiring Jedi.\n\nTFA made me care about Rey and Finn, and that's it. Most of the characters in TFA just don't do anything. Maz, Phasma, Leia, and Hux just don't really matter. Poe is important but he's zero dimensional and barely on screen. Despite this, TFA includes that scene with the Guavian Death Gang, the Kajiklub, and the rathtars. That scene introduces a bunch of incidental characters that nobody cares about but does nothing to develope the characters we might care about. Even the attack on Starkiller Base seems empty compared the the trench run in ANH. The trench run is about Luke learning to use the Force and coming to terms with the realities of war.

"], [7, "As interesting as this is, I disagree as him seeing Rey as his \"property.\" I can get behind that he froze up on Jakku because of fear of death, but when it comes to Rey, I think it is pretty clear that they share a mutual caring for each other. \n\nFinn was a number.

I doubt he got treated much better than a droid by superiors. Then he meets Poe and he humanizes Finn. He treats him like an individual and helps him shed his number and get a real identity. But that is short lived, as Finn quickly believes Poe dies in the crash. \n\nWhen he meets Rey, she is another person who treats him as human. He already (supposedly) lost the first person who treated him like that, so he definitely doesn't want it to happen again. And as a bonus she is a pretty girl (its pretty obvious he, albeit uncussessfully, tries to hit on her). He genuenly cares for her.\n\nFrom Rey's standpoint, she has finally found someone who will stick with her. Her whole life has been abandonment. She gets left on Jakku by who she believes is maybe her parents, and years upon years have passed without them returning. She still holds hope they might but deep down she knows they won't.

He also leads the effort to rescue her from starkiller base. Given her past, she probably expected no one to come. She probably expected to be abandoned again.\n\nThis is also why she is so devastated when Han dies. I doubt she was so upset because they had some travelling time together, because it wasn't that long. Han and Chewie are another two who seem to care about her and won't abandon her. After Han just meets them, he agrees to help them deliver BB-8 (even if he just seems to care about Luke). He offers her a job on the Falcon, showing he wants her around.

Same reason why she is so upset when Kylo severely I juries Finn.\n\nI know I got a little bit off track by talking a lot about Rey, but I think it is important to look at both of them together, their past and the people they meet being the opposite of what they are used to, to realize that they truly care for each other, and don't just see them as property. But if you think that Finn betrayed the first order out of fear of his life in the first place, why would he risk it even further by infiltrating the headquarters of the faction (that he wanted to escape with the mercs from in the first place), without really knowing much about the place (which he admits to lying about), just to save his \"property?\" "], [4, "Translation: Feminist bullshit."], [4, "*Before the Awakening*'s short story for Finn showed that he was compassionate, caring both for his fellow stormtrooper cadets that got the short end of the stick and for the lives of innocent people. On his \"first\" mission (more of a test run really) he's ordered to execute some prisoners, but he finds himself unable too... but the other stormtrooper cadets all do it for him. \n\nI agree that Finn is a man primarily motivated by fear, but I think he also has genuine care for the lives of others. This can also be found in the movie itself, as when the Hosnian System is destroyed by Starkiller, Finn can feel this happening through the force, and he appears horrified. I believe that this is really the reason why he chooses to fight, because he realizes 2 things: 1) there's no running from the First Order, you either fight or die, 2) the First Order needs to be stopped. But he's still fearful, which is why he primarily goes to Starkiller Base to save Rey. I don't really think he's primarily motivated by anger in the latter half of the movie, it's really still fear... I believe it's more likely that he'll learn to conquer his fears than turn to the dark side."], [2, "> TL;DR: Finn is actually a jerk.

Finn knew what Kylo Ren would do to Rey and she didn't deserve that. Rey was captured because Finn was too much of a coward to stick around for 5 more minutes and he probably knew that. Finn is not possessive of Rey in any shape or form. He sees her as his first real friend.\n\n> You might be saying \"But what about when Finn defends Rey from Ren?\" He's fighting for both his own survival and for the woman he sees as his. He fights until he is incapacitated. \n\nHere's a question for you. How do you know Finn believed he and Rey would have made it passed Kylo Ren alive? Look at Finn and Rey's faces when they meet Kylo Ren in the woods. They know that they are dead, and both unconsciously made the decision to die together. Until Rey awakened, their duels against Kylo Ren was a last act of bravado before they were killed. \n\n> When Finn wakes up (probably with some sort of cybernetic enhancement), I would suspect he will still be full of anger. When he learns that Rey is away with Luke, he will see it as a threat. Anger will begin to turn to hate. \n\nI believe Finn would ultimately be happy knowing that Rey is safe and training with Luke. Though he may never see her again, he has a part to play in bringing down the First Order. I don't think he will be influenced by the dark side. In fact, I believe Finn is the best person to influence Ben Solo's return to the light side. \n\n> At some point, Finn will be offered power by Snoke and/or Ren. He will take it. Finn will be our next Dark Jedi. \n\nNo way. Finn is probably priority number one for the First Order. He is the main reason why Starkiller base was destroyed.

I believe that this is really the reason why he chooses to fight, because he realizes 2 things: 1) there's no running from the First Order, you either fight or die, 2) the First Order needs to be stopped. But he's still fearful, which is why he primarily goes to Starkiller Base to save Rey. I don't really think he's primarily motivated by anger in the latter half of the movie, it's really still fear... I believe it's more likely that he'll learn to conquer his fears than turn to the dark side.", "id": "d0ya3yb"}], [{"comment": "> TL;DR: Finn is actually a jerk.

Finn knew what Kylo Ren would do to Rey and she didn't deserve that. Rey was captured because Finn was too much of a coward to stick around for 5 more minutes and he probably knew that. Finn is not possessive of Rey in any shape or form. He sees her as his first real friend.\n\n> You might be saying \"But what about when Finn defends Rey from Ren?\" He's fighting for both his own survival and for the woman he sees as his. He fights until he is incapacitated. \n\nHere's a question for you. How do you know Finn believed he and Rey would have made it passed Kylo Ren alive? Look at Finn and Rey's faces when they meet Kylo Ren in the woods. They know that they are dead, and both unconsciously made the decision to die together. Until Rey awakened, their duels against Kylo Ren was a last act of bravado before they were killed. \n\n> When Finn wakes up (probably with some sort of cybernetic enhancement), I would suspect he will still be full of anger. When he learns that Rey is away with Luke, he will see it as a threat. Anger will begin to turn to hate. \n\nI believe Finn would ultimately be happy knowing that Rey is safe and training with Luke. Though he may never see her again, he has a part to play in bringing down the First Order. I don't think he will be influenced by the dark side. In fact, I believe Finn is the best person to influence Ben Solo's return to the light side. \n\n> At some point, Finn will be offered power by Snoke and/or Ren. He will take it. Finn will be our next Dark Jedi. \n\nNo way. Finn is probably priority number one for the First Order. He is the main reason why Starkiller base was destroyed.

Unless there is a master plan about Rey having repressed memories and trained as a child. It was a bit much for her to be able to pull off a Jedi Mind Trick within 2 tries. It took Ezra two seasons and he was training under someone who actually trained as Jedi during the Clone Wars.\n\nRemember, now, that this movie was co-written by Lawrence Kasdan, the man who wrote Empire and Jedi. This is important, because in those movies, the Force works *exactly* the way it works in The Force Awakens. \n\nWhen Luke is trapped on Hoth in the Wampa's cave, what does he do? He grabs a lightsaber out of the snow using the Force. This is significant, because he was never taught how to do this. Obi Wan never moved an object with the Force in Luke's presence, and Luke had never even heard of the Force before Obi Wan told him about it, so Luke didn't even know moving things with their mind was a thing Jedis could do. \n\nOn Dagobah, during his training, Luke fails to lift the X Wing out of the swamp, and Yoda tells him point blank that he failed to lift the X Wing because he didn't believe he could. Luke didn't need to be trained how to lift it, Yoda wouldn't be so disappointed in him if he did. He just needed to open his mind and let the Force work through him. \n\nLuke runs off without finishing his training, and by the next movie we see that he's a.) constructed his own lightsaber, well enough that even Vader seems impressed by it, b.) learned how to force choke, though admittedly this is really just an extension of moving things and c.) learned the Jedi Mind trick. None of these things were taught to him. And while he's barely able to hold his own against Vader in a saber duel, we also *never* see him train in combat, at all.\n\nSo a very clear picture of The Force is painted here, that these skills are innate, and to tap into them you just need to believe you can. \n\nFast forward to The Force Awakens. Rey has an advantage over Luke; she's heard all the stories. She knows about the different Force tricks and of the Jedi, *and* she already has combat experience. Look at her face when Han tells her all the stories are true. She believes him completely. So here she has another advantage over Luke. Luke was cynical, and doubted himself. Rey isn't. \n\nSo what about all the other Jedi in canon, all the padawans that take years to learn these same tricks? Well, truthfully, this is just a different interpretation of The Force. It's the one Lucas used in the prequels, which established The Force as something that takes a long time to fully learn how to use, with even the simplest powers taking years to master.

Unless there is a master plan about Rey having repressed memories and trained as a child. It was a bit much for her to be able to pull off a Jedi Mind Trick within 2 tries. It took Ezra two seasons and he was training under someone who actually trained as Jedi during the Clone Wars.\n\nRemember, now, that this movie was co-written by Lawrence Kasdan, the man who wrote Empire and Jedi. This is important, because in those movies, the Force works *exactly* the way it works in The Force Awakens. \n\nWhen Luke is trapped on Hoth in the Wampa's cave, what does he do? He grabs a lightsaber out of the snow using the Force. This is significant, because he was never taught how to do this. Obi Wan never moved an object with the Force in Luke's presence, and Luke had never even heard of the Force before Obi Wan told him about it, so Luke didn't even know moving things with their mind was a thing Jedis could do. \n\nOn Dagobah, during his training, Luke fails to lift the X Wing out of the swamp, and Yoda tells him point blank that he failed to lift the X Wing because he didn't believe he could. Luke didn't need to be trained how to lift it, Yoda wouldn't be so disappointed in him if he did. He just needed to open his mind and let the Force work through him. \n\nLuke runs off without finishing his training, and by the next movie we see that he's a.) constructed his own lightsaber, well enough that even Vader seems impressed by it, b.) learned how to force choke, though admittedly this is really just an extension of moving things and c.) learned the Jedi Mind trick. None of these things were taught to him. And while he's barely able to hold his own against Vader in a saber duel, we also *never* see him train in combat, at all.\n\nSo a very clear picture of The Force is painted here, that these skills are innate, and to tap into them you just need to believe you can. \n\nFast forward to The Force Awakens. Rey has an advantage over Luke; she's heard all the stories. She knows about the different Force tricks and of the Jedi, *and* she already has combat experience. Look at her face when Han tells her all the stories are true. She believes him completely. So here she has another advantage over Luke. Luke was cynical, and doubted himself. Rey isn't. \n\nSo what about all the other Jedi in canon, all the padawans that take years to learn these same tricks? Well, truthfully, this is just a different interpretation of The Force. It's the one Lucas used in the prequels, which established The Force as something that takes a long time to fully learn how to use, with even the simplest powers taking years to master. This may even be the way Lucas intended The Force to work from the very beginning, but looking at the original trilogy as it was back in '83, before the Prequels and before the EU, it really wasn't how the Force was characterized on screen. \n\nThe Force Awakens has simply opted to go back to the series' roots, and keep a more mystical, clap-your-hands-if-you-believe approach.", "id": "d6gp9oi"}, {"comment": "> This is significant, because he was never taught how to do this\n\nActually he learned about and practiced it in between IV and V.

In the prequels, there was a lot of filler, over use of CGI, and the 'expansion' of the universe went in the opposite direction of what we wanted (midichlorians, gungans, droid armies that appear, then disappear completely from the universe), and paved the way for movies like \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" or \"Sucker Punch\" where actors pretty much just trot around in front of green screens.", "id": "cxsssbh"}], [{"comment": "I think both trilogies are great, but the prequels had more lightsaber duels and I live for them.

Yes, the Saber fights were cooler and better than the ones in The Force Awakens, but lightsaber duelers in the Prequels were quite experienced in the art of fighting with lightsabers. They have had training and such. Rey and Finn, on the other hand, just pick up lightsabers in TFA and start using them without any training beforehand. So yes, TFA had not as good flashy and cool lightsaber fights, but it was because they have never learned anything about how to do it.

Each time a lightsaber came out you were going to find out more about the characters and that is what made them fascinating to watch.  \n\nThe prequels just made lightsabers into simple weapons that were used to strike at each other...there was very little weight in what was actually going on.  Everyone raves about the fight in TPM but it really just boiled down to a bad guy showed up and they fight him.  The only interesting part was where Qui-gon died and obi-wan was actually having a character moment...at least until the lightsabers turned back on.\n\nTFA brought character moments back to lightsabers.  From Finn deciding to stand up for Rey against the scariest guy in the first order, to Rey accepting her destiny or in seeking out the force.  There was far more going on in that fight than in the 30 minute fight between Obi-wan and Anakin in RotS.

Their pre-planned choreography just got faster.\n\nWhen Palpatine says anger \"gives you focus\", he's full of shit. XD"], [2, "Eh, to each their own. Personally, I find that the duels in the OT and TFA, while not nearly as visually impressive as the duels in the PT, carried a lot more emotional weight to them. A duel doesn't have to be super flippy and up and down massive set pieces to be entertaining or gripping; sometimes just the emotional baggage and connection with the characters is enough to suck you in."], [1, "Jarring yes, but when you look at the OT they pretty much carry them the same way. "], [1, "Here is my theory. These Jedi in the prequel, haven't had a true enemy on the scale of hard sith in a long time. Few and far between. Nothing like Palps and such. So what better use of your time than train and train. Well once everyone gets the essentials down, block all general attacks, and so forth, training becomes superfluous and people get rusty. So, a possible reason for more flash is to add new styles, new techniques, more ways to confuse, disorientate the opponent. Basically boredom in efforts to avoid lack of skill or efforts. \n\nTimes this paid off: \nEP 1 Kenobi v Maul: Obi flips over maul and divides him.\nEp 2 Yoda v Dooku: Yoda hops around like a freak, bouncing to and fro to keep his opponent at bay\nEp 3 Kenobi v Skywalker: Basically the whole battle shows how in a regular duel, had either one of them not known ulterior ways of escaping certain attacks, they would have been defeated. (Backflips, force leaps, etc...) It also pays off at the end when Kenobi knows the fight is over because of the high ground situation.\n\nIn TFA it's pretty blatant that they all suck at fighting, minus Kylo. However, Kylo has hardly had another saber wielder to spar with. I doubt Snoke is in shape to keep up, I may be wrong though. Kylo toys with Finn and Rey but tightens up as it goes on and he sees a small threat. \n\nTL;DR in Prequel, the change up sparring to think of alternate methods of survival/defense.

The duel is fine. They're amateurs after all. But surely lightsabers are pretty freaking lightweight. Why does it look like they're swinging claymores? \n\nEdit: let me clarify. I have no problem with the fact that they were just swinging at each other and not doing any fancy ripostes or whatever. My problem is that they look like they're having trouble actually swinging the lightsabers. What weight is there besides the hilt?

But sure, everything that happened after endor is clouded, but it seems rather logic to me when you consider the obi wans force ghost we see in episode 5 and 6, next point, you said yoda was not able to train luke because he was near death, not true, yoda became ill shortly before episode 6, in episode 5 he was strange ofc, but not weak and certainly aware of his power, when you think about it and we dont know how long luke was on dagobah, could have been a week or a month, it doesnt really matter, in any case it was no year, which means that he learned from a grand master of the jedi order, who was able to train luke in the ways of the force in a short amount of time, which ofc includs lightsaber forms, the reason why we dont see this in the movie is obvious, technical limitation and necessity, but we do know that obi wan (based only on the movies and not what happened between them) tought luke only the basics of lightsaber handling, considering this how was he able to stand even a minute against darth vader, even breaking his defense once, it seems only logical that he was trained by yoda in lightsaber combat, this doesnt mean that yoda had to jump around to show luke how this works there are a lot of possibilities how yoda could have shown luke how to use a lightsaber in combat and last but not least. you said that the empire destroyed all records, documents and so on, that is not entirely true, because we do know that luke built his lightsaber in obi wans hut, which does in some form indicate that obi wan had some sort of documents in his belongings, which does make sense when you think about how long he used to be alone, he might have wrote some knowledge down, yoda himself might have recovered some sort of knowledge when he and obi wan broke into the jedi temple after the purge, im very certain and it would only be logical that they recovered every piece of knowledge they were able to find, if they did so they might have stashed it somewhere till the empire was destroyed for new jedis to use, which luke could have found guided by yoda or obi wan through the force, but even if no knowledge was recovered from the jedi temple, which i doubt, the force ghosts of yoda, obi wan and his father anakin combined had enough knowledge to train luke to become one of the most powerfull jedis, your arugment above that kylo was not that well trained in the old forms does not indicate that luke trained him poorly, we dont know how long he was with luke and we dont saw kylo in good shape, being hit by a bowcaster isnt something you dont care about when you fight, but my guess would have been that kylo was trained by luke but only some basics because it seems that kylo turned to the dark side pretty quick and he might have learned the rest from snoke and we basically know nothing about him and his knowledge of old lightsaber combat forms. But when you think about the fight ray has with kylo, it seemed like she was guided by the force (possibly force ghosts, when you think about the voices she experienced when she first touched lukes lightsaber), she used some lightsaber technics and stances she could have never known, which ofc surprised kylo and turned the odds against him", "id": "d4bny0j"}, {"comment": "1.) Obi-Wan saying \"he could become more powerful than you could possibly imagine\" just meant that if he died, he would become One with the Force, and able to guide Luke from beyond the grave. And while yes, he did appear to Luke a few times, he wasn't constantly there to offer him knowledge. If that were the case, he wouldn't have sent Luke to train with Yoda in the first place. That suggests that Force ghosts are limited in how long/often they can appear to an individual.\n\n2.) You're right. We don't know how long Luke was on Dagobah. But we *do* know that Yoda and Obi-Wan felt that he wasn't there long enough, which is why the urged him not to rush to Cloud City to face Darth Vader. He just wasn't ready, meaning that he probably wasn't as skilled in using the Force or lightsaber combat as he could have been.\n\n3.) Obi-Wan and Yoda didn't go to the Jedi temple to recover data, they wanted to reset the emergency beacon to warn any survivors to stay away. They knew their mission to face Sidious and Vader was too important to risk getting caught in the Temple by stormtroopers, so they went in and out as quickly as possible. \n\n4.) Yes, Obi-Wan did have schematics about how to construct lightsabers. But considering that lightsabers are also used by inquisitors, a good slicer could have also obtained the schematics to build one. Either way, building a device is different from spending nearly a lifetime perfecting how to use it. Lightsaber forms required constant training and hands-on learning, which you couldn't get from a manual, no matter how detailed it would be. It's an art, really. You don't become a good painter by reading about Monet. You become a good painter by painting over and over again.\n\n5.) I can't see someone as frail and wounded as Snoke wielding a lightsaber, no matter how strong he is in the dark side. As for Rey's proficiency with the lightsaber, the Force doesn't tell someone *how* to fight. It just gives them the ability to better predict where their enemy is going to strike. Combine that with Rey having to learn how to use a melee weapon to survive growing up on Jakku and you have a formidable opponent, even if she was never trained in the old lightsaber forms.\n\nEven JJ Abrams said they chose to make the lightsaber fight in TFA less flashy because there would be no one around to train these people in the old lightsaber forms.", "id": "d4bwgpl"}, {"comment": "1.) didnt you remember that obi wan said that he was not able to train anakin as good as yoda could have, dont you think this and the reason that yoda was still alive was a better way to train luke rather than listening to a ghost and nothing hints that force ghosts are limited in any way. Luke had a talk with obi wan after yoda died this conversation was like obi wan was still alive, which does indicate that he would be able to teach luke in the future\n\n2.) the reason why yoda and obi wan felt like luke wasn ready is because, they wanted him to be at his full potential, which means being able to beat not only darth vader but palpatine too, which of course would have taken a long time, but luke regarless of the time he spent on dagobah was able to face darth vader, which would have never been possible if only obi wan trained him with the lightsaber.\n\n3.) but obi wan and yoda had time to watch records of darth vader killing jedis, watching records of how palpatine honored vader, which means they had enough time to recover essential jedi knowledge before leaving the temple for good, there is ofc no indication of that but seems only logical when you think about how wise yoda was and im certain he was aware that obi wan and him might fail to kill palpatine or vader\n\n4.) please dont include inquisitors in a topic regarding the movies, i know they are canon but they have no impact on the story, btw you forgot one thing what about talent? think about how fast anakin learned to use the force, how fast he became more powerfull than any other jedi regardless of his age and training, he was gifted and so is luke, which means he learned everything a lot faster than usual, especially when trained by obi wan and yoda. talent is always above practise. talent and practise combined is the highest form because being able to paint like da vinci is not something you can learn when you cant hold a pencil right, not even when you spend 30 years learning.\n\n5.) snoke might be fragile but so was palpatine and look how he destroyed a bunch of jedi masters. How can u say the force doesnt tell someone how to fight? there is no indication in the movies about that, we dont know what it can and what it cant, we only know that yoda said there is no try, do or do not which means you can do anything as long as you believe you can.\n\nregarding JJ Abrams, he didnt create star wars, what does he know about it? he directed a movie in a world someone else created, to say that the TFA lightsaber fight was less flashy is just untrue, every lightsaber move ray used after she felt the force when kylo was close, was used in episode 1-3, most moves were even from palpatine himself.", "id": "d4c446e"}, {"comment": "All of TFA I waited to see Luke show us what a master on the level of Yoda could do against pathetic whelps like Kylo.

So yes, TFA had not as good flashy and cool lightsaber fights, but it was because they have never learned anything about how to do it.

Everyone raves about the fight in TPM but it really just boiled down to a bad guy showed up and they fight him.  The only interesting part was where Qui-gon died and obi-wan was actually having a character moment...at least until the lightsabers turned back on.\n\nTFA brought character moments back to lightsabers.  From Finn deciding to stand up for Rey against the scariest guy in the first order, to Rey accepting her destiny or in seeking out the force.

So what better use of your time than train and train. Well once everyone gets the essentials down, block all general attacks, and so forth, training becomes superfluous and people get rusty. So, a possible reason for more flash is to add new styles, new techniques, more ways to confuse, disorientate the opponent. Basically boredom in efforts to avoid lack of skill or efforts. \n\nTimes this paid off: \nEP 1 Kenobi v Maul: Obi flips over maul and divides him.\nEp 2 Yoda v Dooku: Yoda hops around like a freak, bouncing to and fro to keep his opponent at bay\nEp 3 Kenobi v Skywalker: Basically the whole battle shows how in a regular duel, had either one of them not known ulterior ways of escaping certain attacks, they would have been defeated. (Backflips, force leaps, etc...) It also pays off at the end when Kenobi knows the fight is over because of the high ground situation.\n\nIn TFA it's pretty blatant that they all suck at fighting, minus Kylo. However, Kylo has hardly had another saber wielder to spar with. I doubt Snoke is in shape to keep up, I may be wrong though. Kylo toys with Finn and Rey but tightens up as it goes on and he sees a small threat. \n\nTL;DR in Prequel, the change up sparring to think of alternate methods of survival/defense.

So, a possible reason for more flash is to add new styles, new techniques, more ways to confuse, disorientate the opponent. Basically boredom in efforts to avoid lack of skill or efforts. \n\nThere's a lot to be said about this theory, and if you look at the history of real martial arts, you see a couple of tendencies: There is a tendency towards practical self-defense (what actually works in a real fight) - and there are several aspects to this, and real martial arts diverged across these aspects: civilian self-defense, combat sports, and military technique.  There are other aspects, but no martial art really covers all of these bases.  In fact, combat sports will break down into several different categories, depending on which specific sport you're talking about (judo, sumo, greco-roman wrestling, boxing, kickboxing, mma, etc) because each sport has a different set of rules (which moves are legal, and illegal, etc).  Civilian self defense also has many different aspects due to different situations: are you fighting one inexperienced dude in a barfight? are you teaching women how to fend off a rapist? are you teaching one person how to fend off a gang of aggressors?  Then, in military fighting, you have rules of engagement, (ie. in the field, is it considered \"murder\", legally, if you practice how to sneak up behind an unaware opponent like a guard and slit their throat? would that cause a political incident?).\n\nThere are literally dozens if not hundred different distinct martial arts that are dedicated to these different aspects, or some subset of these aspects.\n\nAnd then: many of these martial arts have delved into stylized fighting, where techniques and moves have purposes that are more aesthetic.  The whole Chinese tradition of kung fu that comes from the Shaolin styles, evolved in a setting where the practitioners didn't really have much in the way of practical self-defense to worry about. Even the founder of the style, Boddhidharma, wrote that the basis of the forms and techniques came from the movements of animals (real or imagined), in order to make it easier to teach.  Then it evolved into more esoteric maneuvers from there; including a lot of moves that have supposed mystical applications (developing \"chi\" or \"internal energy\") - and the practical applications of a lot of this are obscure to the point where if you put a practitioner of a pure form of this art into a real self-defense situation, or combat sport, they'll get beat ONLY because their technique is \"aesthetic\" rather than practical. (this kind of talk quickly turns into a heated and angry debate: I'll point you to the Royce Gracie challenge videos on YouTube for real-world examples of practical technique beating aesthetic technique.)  (there are also PLENTY of MMA/UFC fight videos out there where you see a total upset when a traditional or aesthetic martial art technique is applied, and it completely destroys the well-trained athletic sport-fighter.  I think in most of these cases, the traditionalist was cross-trained in more sport-oriented technique - you will NEVER see a \"pure tai chi\" guy win an MMA fight. You'll see tai chi as a basis for some techniques that can actually be useful: but the rigor of a pure, soft tai chi style will never stand up to real sport-fight technique.  If it ever did, I'd LOVE to see the video). \n\nI think if you look at the fight choreography in these movies: I think it was done by people trained in martial arts (and movie fight choreography, for sure).  Fight choreography was in an extremely primitive state when the OT was made.  I think when the PT was made, there was an idea, that in general, the Old Republic, across the board, had a civilization that was more artistic, more aesthetic. It was referring to our classical greco-roman period. They showed this in the architecture, the ship design, and in the Jedi fighting styles.  The traditional Jedi fighting styles were obviously full of aestheticly pleasing moves - and probably due to a large part the fact that they already had combat effectiveness very well nailed down, they were INSULATED from the needs of practical technique, by virtue of their position in society. Much like the Shaolin monks in their early period.  \n\nLater in the Shaolin history - they actually WERE required to get into real fights, and gained real experience, both in civilian defense, and military action. I think that happened to the Jedi over a very short period. One generation of Jedi, during the Clone Wars.  All of the old \"stylized\" fighters got killed - definitely by the end, when Order 66 was given.  The only old stylized fighters left were Obiwan and Anakin, and Yoda.  In their last fight, Anakin was gravely crippled.  And over the next 30 years, they both aged.  And Yoda aged too.\n\nI take kenpo from a very old guy.  He can't even demonstrate a lot of the more flourishy kung fu type moves anymore.  I'm not that young either, so it's hard for me to even learn them.  I think this would definitely \"justify\" why the Vader/Kenobi fight in ANH was so laid back, by comparison.  Neither of them had it in them anymore.\n\nIt does stand to reason that there are duellists out there, who were neither Jedi nor Sith, who have preserved a repertoire of fighting arts.  Luke could have learned from any of those.  \n\nBut I think the general \"design concept\" of the new Repubplic, versus the Empire, versus the Old Republic, will probably stand, that the whole culture and civlization of the galaxy has degraded, in terms of aesthetics.  They're in a cultural decline, much like we are, here in the 20th century, compared to say, our Renaissance period.  The fighting styles are necessarily going to look more raw, and practical.  From a swords standpoint, it's going to look a lot less like Jet Li, and a lot more like say, Braveheart.

She actually does fulfill the major points of the hero's journey, or should I say heroine's journey. Her biggest weakness in The Force Awakens is her refusal to let go of the past and accept her destiny that lies ahead. All three of the major new characters in TFA have issues with identity. Finn and Kylo's identity issues are more obvious, but Rey has it too. She's naturally gifted, or the Force might have chosen to \"awaken\" within her. However, Rey chooses to deny this part of herself. So, her arc could be interpreted as a metaphor for people to accept their own identity, or it could even be seen as an allegory of Taoist thought. An important aspect of Taoism is relenting control of your life to the Tao, the universe, and going with its flow, as it will take you where you're meant to be. Rey fails when she tries to control her life. It isn't until she lets go and puts her faith in the Force that she really succeeds."], [6, "Others here have addressed her character flaws, so since the biggest complaint is usually her abilities, I'll address that. For most of the things people complain about her being too good at she actually starts out failing.  Her take-off in the Falcon is horrendous even though she's familiar with the ship and has flown before, and she only pulls off one impressive move that's more about tactics than piloting skill.  She misses quite a bit with the blaster, she initially cannot resist Kylo, but learns from him while he's digging around in her mind, and still fails the first couple times she tries to influence a weak-minded Stormtrooper.  Regarding the saber fight with Kylo, remember this is a seriously injured apprentice she's fighting; Kylo is no Darth Vader or Maul. She has melee combat experience, wasn't seriously hurt, and seems to be stronger with the Force.  She was still on the defensive for most of the fight until she let the force guide her and took advantage of an opening.  Obviously her accomplishments are impressive and indicate she is very gifted, but she hasn't shown anything crazier than Anakin or Luke in my opinion, both of whom were better pilots with similarly minimal experience."], [3, "I would suggest reading her \"Before the Awakening\" short story.

There again though, there's plenty for the writers to work with. She's a scared orphan (?) with massive expectations suddenly placed her that she's struggling to accept. If you think Rian Johnson can't do something with that, I don't know what to tell you.\n\n> I think that the potential plot hooks regarding Jakku and her parents are interesting, and I hope the coming movies showcase her in a much more well rounded way\n\nWhy not look at it like that, then?  There's no reason for them to rush her development- Rey is the central character to this trilogy, and her story will span the whole three films.\n\nAs for foreshadowing, there's no way to tell if there's any there or not until the payoff in later films (if there is one). Her instant ability to grasp the Force could well be foreshadowing of a reveal of her past, and I don't believe the lightsaber subplot *is* resolved. Rey is a good girl with a strong call to the Dark, mirroring Kylo Ren, and too much was made of it in episode 7 to not explore it further.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you from asking questions-- it fascinates me that someone else can put as much thought into the same subject and come to such a different opinion-- but give people's answers a go too. You don't have to change your mind, but you never will if you're already thinking of a counterpoint.", "id": "d7hvhbd"}, {"comment": "I just have to ask this, do you really think Luke is acting like a child when he is confronting the Emperor, or are you just playing devil's advocate?", "id": "d7gwduu"}, {"comment": "A little of both, really. I love Luke, but his annoying moments are more annoying than anyone else in the OT except Leia.

She actually does fulfill the major points of the hero's journey, or should I say heroine's journey. Her biggest weakness in The Force Awakens is her refusal to let go of the past and accept her destiny that lies ahead. All three of the major new characters in TFA have issues with identity. Finn and Kylo's identity issues are more obvious, but Rey has it too. She's naturally gifted, or the Force might have chosen to \"awaken\" within her. However, Rey chooses to deny this part of herself. So, her arc could be interpreted as a metaphor for people to accept their own identity, or it could even be seen as an allegory of Taoist thought. An important aspect of Taoism is relenting control of your life to the Tao, the universe, and going with its flow, as it will take you where you're meant to be.

She misses quite a bit with the blaster, she initially cannot resist Kylo, but learns from him while he's digging around in her mind, and still fails the first couple times she tries to influence a weak-minded Stormtrooper.  Regarding the saber fight with Kylo, remember this is a seriously injured apprentice she's fighting; Kylo is no Darth Vader or Maul. She has melee combat experience, wasn't seriously hurt, and seems to be stronger with the Force.  She was still on the defensive for most of the fight until she let the force guide her and took advantage of an opening.

Not Boyega's fault.

Viewers, however, would then expect a gradual period of de-programming as the natural personality emerges from the indoctrination. \n\nFinn's lines and actions were instead written as if he were the uniformed misfit, forcibly conscripted from the streets of Taris or something, and was smart enough to perform well in training, but couldn't stand The First Order or any of the other jarhead-types. Under *that* premise, it makes sense for Finn to cradle a dying Stormtrooper one minute, and booyah the next as he incinerates any number of *other* comrades in the docking bay.

We just had the downside in the movie of that being the first itme we see him and think its a part of his character. In the book you get a better sense of understanding that it was his first battle, he had only been training up until that point, and like so many soldiers find the realities and atrocities of war far more terrifying.  \n  \nWhat, I guess, makes him special is a sense of right and wrong.

It was chance that brought Luke/Han/Lando to Sluis Van just as Thrawn sprung his raid, after all.  He had plans to return ten years after his death, but it was pretty much luck that caused Luke/Mara to stumble upon his clone not too long before it was planned to awaken, and unfortunate circumstances that ultimately forced them to destroy it.\n\nSimply having secret knowledge or technology (which were mostly dug up by Thrawn's own detective work, not simply handed to him by a third party, mind you) is a portion of the battle; actually putting it into action is another matter entirely.  Thrawn blockaded Coruscant with some cloaked asteroids.  He nearly had Ackbar impeached with a seemingly random credit drop-off.  With the most random bits of information and esoteric tech, he could predict almost exactly how his opponents would react to his every move and find a way to crush them; that was his main strength.  During Nuso Esva's final stand, when he had a spy record Esva's artwork, he *knew* Esva had purposely displayed them, formed a battle strategy that on the surface was just close to what he *knew* Esva would expect, and then absolutely steamrolled Esva with minimal losses.\n\nSpeaking of Esva, people usually point out that Zsinj built out a pretty little warlord empire for himself using his excellent organizational skills and business connections, but Thrawn pulled something somewhat similar with the Empire of the Hand.  He had the advantage of starting with the blessing of Palpatine and a steady trickle of Imperial resources into the Unknown Regions (at least until Endor happened), but unlike Zsinj, Thrawn had to deal with completely transforming his expeditionary force into something completely alien to the core Empire's philosophies: non-oppressive and non-racist.  By the time of the Thrawn Trilogy, the Empire of the Hand was a confederacy made up of multiple species, with its own \"501st Legion\" with humans and non-humans alike.  Even the isolationist Chiss who had exiled Thrawn had been convinced to grudgingly throw support for him (secretly, of course).  And when Thrawn left to go rally the Imperial Remnant back in the known galaxy and never returned, the Empire of the Hand ran on without a hitch, running self-sufficiently and continuing its build-up in preparation of the Yuuzhan Vong for over a decade, right up until they actually hit (forgot what ultimately happened to it, probably still got shattered eventually).\n\nHe even seeded random groups of elite clone sleeper cells on various planets during the Thrawn Campaign, hard-wired with an innate knowledge and an intense love of whatever planet they were placed on in order to act as potential guerilla fighters against the impending Vong threat.  Not 100% loyal to the Empire, either, because Thrawn knew that if he was gone and some dirty Imperial emperor wannabe later down the line got his grubby hands on the activation codes they'd use the clones for their own schemes.

That thing's nigh unreadable.\n\nNow to your points, in no particular order: I enjoyed the voice-work tremendously. Lanter has a forceful voice, one well suited to the high-energy situations Anakin's constantly put through.\n\nAnd I disagree on the dark moments being out of place: To me, even the most heroic of Anakin's deeds are linked to his most villainous in TCW. This quote by Obi-Wan, from the ROTS novelization, puts it best:\n\n\"For Anakin, there is nothing more important than friendship. He is the most loyal man I've ever met\u2014loyal beyond reason; in fact, abstractions like peace don't mean much to him. He's loyal to people, not to principles. And he expects loyalty in return. He will stop at nothing to save me, for example, because he thinks I would do the same for him\u2026 because he knows I would do the same for him.\"\n\nThis ruthless devotion, I find, is omnipresent with Anakin as portrayed in the show; it's there when he makes a heroic diversion from the plan to save his soldiers' lives, and it's there when he goes berserk on an unarmed Asajj Ventress to save Ahsoka. It's all connected, you see?"], [11, "I like TCW Anakin because it made him feel like more of a genuine character to me. The Anakin of the movies is whiny, kind of unsympathetic to me, and his fall to the dark side felt so sudden. The movies also tried to sell the bonds between Anakin and Padme, and Anakin and Obi-Wan as deep and important, but I never felt it. TCW fixes this a great deal. The Anakin in TCW feels more like a hero who did honestly fall, rather than a whiny brat. There's more to everyone than just aaaaaannngggsst. I like that TCW shows this. I also feel TCW made Anakin's fall feel more subtle than just in your face and aprupt. And I feel his characterization is still in line with his characterization in the prequels. Anakin does a lot of heroic things, yes, but he does them out of a sense of attachment and loyalty to those he cares about. And his dark side is also shown to be tied to those he cares about. He almost kills Ventress in his quest to enoxerate Ahsoka. He goes after those who he thought killed Obi-Wan to avenge him. He almost kills Clovis out of jealousy for his wife. After Ahsoka leaves, he's devastated, and has likely lost a lot of trust in the Order. And in the movies he kills a whole village to avenge his mother, and goes to terrible lengths to save his wife. Anakin's dark side is directly tied to those he loves because he feels attachment deeply. And when those attachments are threatned he is willing to do terrible things. That's why I like the TCW Anakin. It justifies and reinforces a lot of his personality in the movies, and shows there's more to him than just that. That he was a good person in a lot of ways, and that though his attachments are what caused his fall and bring out his worst, they are also what bring out his best and are what saved him in the end."], [10, "I actually enjoyed the Anakin much more in TCW then the movies.

That thing's nigh unreadable.\n\nNow to your points, in no particular order: I enjoyed the voice-work tremendously. Lanter has a forceful voice, one well suited to the high-energy situations Anakin's constantly put through.\n\nAnd I disagree on the dark moments being out of place: To me, even the most heroic of Anakin's deeds are linked to his most villainous in TCW. This quote by Obi-Wan, from the ROTS novelization, puts it best:\n\n\"For Anakin, there is nothing more important than friendship. He is the most loyal man I've ever met\u2014loyal beyond reason; in fact, abstractions like peace don't mean much to him. He's loyal to people, not to principles. And he expects loyalty in return. He will stop at nothing to save me, for example, because he thinks I would do the same for him\u2026 because he knows I would do the same for him.\"\n\nThis ruthless devotion, I find, is omnipresent with Anakin as portrayed in the show; it's there when he makes a heroic diversion from the plan to save his soldiers' lives, and it's there when he goes berserk on an unarmed Asajj Ventress to save Ahsoka. It's all connected, you see?", "id": "d963t4n"}, {"comment": "I feel like I was a little too harsh on TCW Anakin in my post. I don't nessecarily *hate* TCW Anakin, it just bugs me how different he is from movie Anakin. I feel like his constant moral line crossing could have been done well without diverting the character so much from the source material. It's really annoying how different he is from his movie counterpart, in physical attributes like voice and appearance as well as his personality. The way movie Anakin straddled the line between good and evil was much different than TCW. In the movies Anakin was portrayed as a confused man who never had the chance to experience a real childhood. Although he was an adult, his sudden removal from his Tatooine life left him confused and forced him to never really grow out of his childlike immaturity, hence his crippling angst and two dimensional idealism.\n\nIn TCW Anakin is portrayed in a way that is more accurate to the quote from the RotS novelization you brought up. He was extremely loyal to his friends and his intense heroism often led him to break the traditional Jedi role in order to insure the safety of his friends. Both portrayals are valid ways of showcasing a character who struggles with finding his place on the light/dark spectrum, my issue comes from the inconsistency. It's difficult to convince myself that the uber loyal Anakin of TCW is the same angsty Anakin we see fall into the trap of selfishness guised as selflessness in Episode III (in my opinion Anakin's fall wasn't because of a selfless devotion to Padme, but instead a selfish fear of who *he'd* be without her.)\n\nWhether you prefer one portrayal over the other doesn't effect the fact that the inconsistency makes his fall to the dark feel out of character when watching Episode III after watching the Clone Wars.\n\nAlso I hate Matt Lanter's voice work. He doesn't even try to make himself sound like Anakin's established voice which, once again, is an issue of inconsistency.", "id": "d97fhqd"}, {"comment": "I'd care about him being different from prequel Anakin, if prequel Anakin wasn't a horrible character.", "id": "d97w3fb"}, {"comment": "I prefer prequel Anakin to TCW Anakin, and I'm not even a huge fan of his prequel rendition.", "id": "d97wovt"}], [{"comment": "I like TCW Anakin because it made him feel like more of a genuine character to me. The Anakin of the movies is whiny, kind of unsympathetic to me, and his fall to the dark side felt so sudden. The movies also tried to sell the bonds between Anakin and Padme, and Anakin and Obi-Wan as deep and important, but I never felt it. TCW fixes this a great deal. The Anakin in TCW feels more like a hero who did honestly fall, rather than a whiny brat. There's more to everyone than just aaaaaannngggsst. I like that TCW shows this. I also feel TCW made Anakin's fall feel more subtle than just in your face and aprupt. And I feel his characterization is still in line with his characterization in the prequels. Anakin does a lot of heroic things, yes, but he does them out of a sense of attachment and loyalty to those he cares about. And his dark side is also shown to be tied to those he cares about. He almost kills Ventress in his quest to enoxerate Ahsoka. He goes after those who he thought killed Obi-Wan to avenge him. He almost kills Clovis out of jealousy for his wife. After Ahsoka leaves, he's devastated, and has likely lost a lot of trust in the Order. And in the movies he kills a whole village to avenge his mother, and goes to terrible lengths to save his wife. Anakin's dark side is directly tied to those he loves because he feels attachment deeply. And when those attachments are threatned he is willing to do terrible things. That's why I like the TCW Anakin. It justifies and reinforces a lot of his personality in the movies, and shows there's more to him than just that. That he was a good person in a lot of ways, and that though his attachments are what caused his fall and bring out his worst, they are also what bring out his best and are what saved him in the end.", "id": "d9691dw"}], [{"comment": "I actually enjoyed the Anakin much more in TCW then the movies.

Have you seen the prequels, my dude? They constantly have to tell what their characters are feeling rather than showing, and they just keep to the same mundane, safe camerawork. \n\nHow does Force Awakens fail at visual storytelling? It's better than all the SW movies combined I feel when it comes to this matter. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna point out all the major ones scene by scene in the whole film. Here you go.\n\n- The opening shot With the big Star Destroyer covering the whole planet, it shows that the First Order is invading, how they are taking pages from the Empire, and how big the First Order really is and how the Empire has grown to be even more powerful. \n\n- The raid on Jakku. We see FN-2187's uncertainty and apprehension, not shown by telling the audience or even facial expressions, but all through the direction, camera angles and lighting. \n\n- Then we expand on 2187's apprehension when we see the death of his friend and how he doesn't shoot anyone. It was expanded later in the books, but even in the film, again without saying anything, we can see that they are friends and Finn just got definitive character moment that made him desert the FO\n\n- Kylo Ren and Captain Phasma, man. Good God. Not even mentioning their costume designs, once again  their presence, camera angles, lighting and body language just tells you these guys mean business. You feel like Kylo is staring at you through that mask.\n\n- As for Phasma you can just tell she's a higher rank than the stormtroopers. Unlike the pawns she commands, she walks with a casual hip-sway and stands with more of a presence, with a taller stance than the others. This and her armor tells you her rank. \n\n- With Rey on Jakku, without a line of dialogue you can tell what her living conditions are. Sliding down an avalanche of sand, collecting junk from a crashed destroyer, and how even a drop of water is heaven for her. That and so many other things like those tally-marks and others, it's simply brilliant. Great direction here.\n\n- Snoke. Jesus Christ, Snoke. Even if he isn't actually giant, the way the camera hides his face, the way the hologram makes him LOOK giant, it's just so fucking good and shows you how menacing Snoke is.\n\n- \"I didn't know there was so much green in the whole Galaxy.\" yes it's dialogue, but how the camera excitingly reveals the planet, and the look on Rey's face, you can just see how new this is to her. For her entire life she's lived on a planet that Tatooine would call barren, and now she's seeing this lush, new environment and the visuals do a great job of aiding this, as well as providing a parallel for a later scene I'll mention soon. \n\n- Maz Kanata's castle. This was in A New Hope as well, but it's really impressive how looking at all the different aliens, exotic interior decorating and dimly lit cantina shows that this is a shady environment even in a galaxy far, far away, not to mention very foreign.\n\n- Do I even need to mention that vision scene? The visuals almost completely tell the story here, and how Rey feels conflicted and, like Finn, deep down wants to run away from the force.\n\n- Say what you want about the Hosnian Prime scene, but they really did it well in terms of visual storytelling. With the laser beams going across the Star system, seeing the terror in the Resistance people's eyes and then the terror in the Hosnian residence's eyes... very well done, even if it isn't that good a scene story-wise.\n\n- That scene with Kylo Ren and you-know-who on the bridge. The dim lighting, the conflict you can see in both of their eyes, the bottomless pit below them... and finally when the lightsaber strikes into you-know-who's heart. Whenever I rewatch the movie again, I still know what's going to happen yet with how long the scene takes and the pain you can see in their faces it LITERALLY makes me sick to my stomach, and that's primarily because of how well it's shot.\n\n- And seconds after that gut-wrenching heartbreaker is done, their expressions tell the story even better. You can see the regret in Kylo's eyes, and how even though he has done an unforgivable thing, Han still forgives him. Again, the expressions and cinematography really make this scene great.\n\n- Rey grabbing the lightsaber with the force. The way it's shot, the classic Star Wars music finally playing, THIS is the moment that the force truly \"awakens\" in Rey. It's the moment that she stops running and the way that it's shot and Daisy Ridley's great acting in it really shows that. \n\n- The Millennium Falcon leaving the Resistance base, and flying off in search for Luke. It's such a good and emotional shot that part of me thinks the movie should have ended right there. But it didn't, so lets continue.\n\n- Rey and Chewie looking at each other as they approach Ahch-To. This perfectly echoes the scene with Rey and Han going to Takonda and actually pulls off developing a character who only speaks in grunts and growls. \n\n- And lastly, Luke looking at Rey and Rey reaching out to give Luke the lightsaber. Holy fucking crap, this is fantastic. The cinematography is fantastic once again, we can see both Luke's and Rey's facial expressions tell us what they feel without either one of them saying a single word. Luke is afraid, apprehensive. He knows this girl and why she's here, but he doesn't know if he has the strength to train her. And Rey is also afraid. Though she has accepted that she can use the force, she is afraid she will let Luke down, and all this is told from purely visuals. Simply amazing.\n\nSo yeah, I hope you enjoyed my fucking essay on why I think the visual storytelling in TFA is the best yet. Hope you enjoyed it, I certainly enjoyed writing it.

Have you seen the prequels, my dude? They constantly have to tell what their characters are feeling rather than showing, and they just keep to the same mundane, safe camerawork. \n\nVisually, the prequels are pretty great, with a ton of cool stuff.\n\nCool planets:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DPt9m0A.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2V2hiOJ.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nQ7Gqgf.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2Ydf1d7.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/t4RvHxD.png\n\nWeird-looking aliens:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0TDTJQz.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/45kKYG5l.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JV3Rosil.png\n\nHomages to the original films:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0wEbOf1l.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZEGaEgk.png (ref: http://i.imgur.com/lzCFQyF.png)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/btabe7E.png (ref: http://i.imgur.com/LbhGacM.png)\nhttp://d2oah9q9xdinv5.cloudfront.net/videos/groups/1/5/4674/HD-1080p-Mace-Windu-vs-Darth-Sidious-n-Anakin-Skywalkerwww.savevid.com.mp4.jpg (ref: http://i.imgur.com/N5xD5pVl.png)\n\nNeat ships:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Mw8Mj7P.png\n\n\nNothing's memorable about this:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iewsoPD.png\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/9vip2f.jpg\n\nHere's a comparison showing basically every single shot that was lifted from A New Hope. In nearly every case, the New Hope version is better:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/160263943\n\n>The opening shot With the big Star Destroyer covering the whole planet, it shows that the First Order is invading, how they are taking pages from the Empire, and how big the First Order really is and how the Empire has grown to be even more powerful. \n\nThe problem is that this isn't a unique way to show the power of the First Order, and is a lot less interesting and exciting than the opener to A New Hope (which it apes). Basically, we're not being shown anything *new* in this movie. Not to mention we're never actually *shown* them approaching the planet from space.\n\nIn a New Hope, you have the gradual reveal of information: we start out in the empty void of space, then the view pans down to reveal that we're over a planet. (Random observation: Tatooine also has two moons - one big and one small.) Then, suddenly, there's a loud noise and the two ships fly in from behind the audience.\n\nIt's a perfect gradual reveal of information: you are in space, then it's revealed that you're in a specific location in space, and then you get a reveal of what's happening at that location (the two ships are shooting at eachother). The next two shots establish that the smaller ship is losing the battle - so you have an extremely good idea of what's going on when we finally cut to the actors inside the ship.\n\nTFA is doing something different: it's based around a series of misleading images that reverse your expectations. It appears that we're in empty space, then the camera pans down to these planetoids that we assume are the setting. But then the black ship appears, and it turns out that what we perceived as negative space was actually a threatening object in the foreground. Then the smaller ships emerge and fly towards the camera, so it turns out the planetoid is (probably) not the setting. Eventually, when you piece all the clues together, it turns out we were never in the space at all; we were lying down on the surface of Jakku and looking straight up at its sky.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the next shot is a close-up of the USB key being placed in Oscar Isaac's hand, which does nothing to clarify what just happened. We don't actually see Jakku from space until much later in the film, and it doesn't really look too different from the white moon. Despite being the very first thing we see in the film, the moons do not factor into the plot in any way. It's only in retrospect that you can puzzle out how the eclipse of the light & dark moons by the huge shadow represents Rey and FN being menaced by Kylo.\n\nEmpire also has a better, similar shot at the start of the film. The Star Destroyer enters the frame and launches a probe, but instead of cutting away from it, the camera tracks it down to the planet. So we've established spacially exactly what's happening.\n\n>Snoke. Jesus Christ, Snoke. Even if he isn't actually giant, the way the camera hides his face, the way the hologram makes him LOOK giant, it's just so fucking good and shows you how menacing Snoke is.\n\nSnoke's scenes are possibly the worst scenes in the films, being very visually uninteresting and not providing us with anything useful in terms of dialogue either. When Vader kneels before the Emperor and calls him master, we're being given a lot of information, especially when we see that the Emperor is some old dude in a hood. With Snoke, the characters are telling each other things they already know, and then the most interesting piece of information, that there's an \"awakening\" in the Force, is met with a \"yes\" and immediately moved on from. They don't even kneel before his weird gigantic throne.\n\nIn a lot of ways Snoke and Kylo Ren are very similar. Both are pretending to be something they're not. Snoke is trying to present himself as a power ruler, with his title and hologram setup. Similarly, Kylo Ren is trying to *act* unhinged, but pretty much nobody buys it. In Empire, for example, the officers obviously fear Vader, and he's very distant from them with his meditation chamber. He barely interacts with anybody except to execute them or issue orders. We're never shown that with Kylo.\n\nIt's important to note that Snoke is such an ill-defined, poorly thought-out, boring character, that people have been posting for months now that he could actually be the mythical Darth Plagueis, a character mentioned once in a brief scene. If he was actually good people would be talking about what we're shown.\n\n>Maz Kanata's castle. This was in A New Hope as well, but it's really impressive how looking at all the different aliens, exotic interior decorating and dimly lit cantina shows that this is a shady environment even in a galaxy far, far away, not to mention very foreign.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the characters inside basically don't do anything and nobody interacts with them in a meaningful way beyond talking to Maz, who is just awful. With the canteen in Mos Eisley, we're first shown a busy town that establishes a need for a bar. Hell, there's even some anti-droid racism that goes on too! With Maz we're not shown any of this, as far as we know the rest of the planet is abandoned.  It's less interesting than Mos Eisley's cantina and it's far less memorable than the bar in Attack of the Clones. \n\nThis scene is a lot like the opener: it's a reversal of expectations. They show up to this weird castle and there's some robot walking out of it, but then it just turns out to be a dive bar (where the heck are the patrons coming from?). With Mos Eisley, we get exactly what we're shown: the exterior is a dumpy mud hut and the inside is a rough bar.\n\n>And seconds after that gut-wrenching heartbreaker is done, their expressions tell the story even better. You can see the regret in Kylo's eyes, and how even though he has done an unforgivable thing, Han still forgives him. Again, the expressions and cinematography really make this scene great.\n\nDid we watch the same scene? Ren gets over whatever grief he has in the next scene apparently and basically immediately moves on with his life. The scene is filmed in basically shot-reverse shot while they talk to each other, and then Han falls into red clouds. The Luke-Vader encounter did basically the same thing (revelatory confrontation on a catwalk) and it was *way* better. Not to mention that their relationship wasn't really even established before this scene (and we don't even know what happened that drove Han and Kylo apart), leaches a lot of the emotional weight out of this scene.\n\nWell I'm out of time, sorry I couldn't address more of your points, but hopefully I gave you something to think about.", "id": "d3ojhzm"}, {"comment": "It is true that the prequels had decent planets and stuff, but their direction and camerawork is just utter crap, and constantly have to tell you what their characters feel rather than show it through visuals of direction, which is what TFA does. \n\nAs for the rest of your argument, well I just don't have time to read it right about now.

Meanwhile every line in the prequels is someone saying \"I'm angry\" or \"I love you\" or something like that rather than showing us how the characters feel.\n\nLet's look at exactly what happens in a Snoke scene:\n\n>Snoke: The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance, leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.\n\n>General Hux: Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility\u2014\n\n>Snoke: GENERAL!! Our strategy must now change.\n\n>General Hux: The weapon...it is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance...the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.\n\n>Snoke: Go. Oversee preparations.\n\n>General Hux: Yes, Supreme Leader.\n\n>Snoke: There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?\n\n>Kylo Ren: Yes.\n\n>Snoke: There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon...in the hands of your father, Han Solo.\n\n>Kylo Ren: He means nothing to me.\n\n>Snoke: Even you, Master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.\n\n>Kylo Ren: By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.\n\n>Snoke: We shall see. [as his hologram fades] We shall see. \n\nNow, in terms of the film, this dialogue makes *no sense*. Hux basically explains to Snoke who the Republic is, and Snoke explains why it'll be bad if the droid escapes. Snoke makes sure to name drop Han Solo as though Kylo forgot who his dad was. The most interesting bit of dialogue, an \"awakening\" in The Force, is *completely* glossed over.

The wrecked landscape shows you that the Empire is destroyed, and has been for some time, but the crashed X-Wings show that it was costly for everyone involved.

She obviously sees herself as capable of something greater, but she knows that her future could easily be what she sees in front of her.\n- The scene when we go back to Rey's home tells us a lot as well. Beyond the stuff that shows us her personal history, her possessions tell us about the state of the Galaxy: the imperial items (the walker) are simply reused, while the rebel gear is held in reverence. Later, we meet a character who has opposite tastes.\n\nIf what you want from \"visual storytelling\" is a bunch of stuff on the screen that you look up the names of later, that great, but it tells us nothing about history or the characters.

Not sure why that's so hard to capture.", "id": "czf7yzb"}, {"comment": "The issue is with people who don't actually practice likeness, like...at all.\n\nI'm no pro but I practice likeness so I can 1. Better capture the look of someone if I wish to draw them/their character and 2. It helps to learn expressions, facial proportion, etc. even for more cartoony styles.\n\nI don't find her particularly difficult. To me, she's at tough to draw as most people are when you want it to legitimately look like the person. As for more stylized drawings, again... I'm not sure why it'd be any more difficult to draw her than anyone else. Even in this picture, none of them resemble the actor/character aside from the outfit.\n\nTo my eye, it looks like the artist is someone who has grown up doodling, sketching, copying, and then practicing very stylized art--stuff like anime or Disney cartoons or both--rather than practicing likeness and stuff. You see that a lot, people who are technically skilled at what they do (i.e. someone who primarily draws in some sort of anime/western fusion blend that you see on tumblr and deviantart a lot) but are unable to really differentiate or exaggerate iconic features on someone to make them unique. So then a lot of their characters wind up looking very similar albeit with different outfits and hair.\n\nThis image for instance, nothing really strikes me as particularly Natalie Portman or Carrie Fisher or Daisy Ridley. We only know because of the outfit. They all vaguely look alike, Disney Princessish with big eyes and all around svelte bodies.\n\nTo an extent one can say \"that's just the style\" but it is 100% possible to retain a style like this (something like South Park is not really applicable as that is *so* stylized that people don't really even resemble people) and still make the character look somewhat like the person more than just with the outfit.\n\nThat's not to knock the artist or act like I'm better. That's a judgment for others to make. I say this from experience: I used to struggle with drawing women but then I practiced that and have gotten significantly better at that in recent years. I used to suck with proportion but then I practiced and got better with that. I used to suck with likeness. It's something I'd periodically try (when I tried to make my own comic adaptation of Attack of the Clones way back in 2nd grade, in 8th grade when I thought I could do it, in high school, etc.). I finally sat down and practiced and practiced and knowing what I knew of basic facial structure and proportion, I can now do it. At least vaguely.\n\nPhil Noto is a perfect example of someone who has a very obvious style. When he does likeness, it very clearly looks like the person but the angles are sharper around the face and it looks like someone he would/could have drawn in a comic without even using reference because it's still 100% within that style.\n\nEdit: okay so I checked the artist's instagram out and it's...very strange. Their Alan Rickman tribute is a pretty good likeness. Immediately recognizable even beyond the Snape hair and outfit. Then they has a very cartoony and exaggerated older TFA Leia with big eyes and whatnot but still actually resembles Carrie Fisher. It was basically a caricature. But then they have this piece with the three of them plus there's a Taylor Swift piece and the likeness is not very great. I recognize the pose and hair from a photo I did a while back.\n\nSooooo...kind of all over the place. Likeness is definitely not the easiest thing in the world but the older Leia piece is, interestingly enough, evocative of the same exact style present in this piece but still distinct so that we can tell it's Carrie.

This provides character conflict. But we don't need BB-8 to diffuse it by telling them, since it serves no story purpose. Imagine instead if BB-8 refused, and right then Han's freighter showed up. The character essence of the scene is maintained without dead-end information. \n\nAs far as the Falcon at Starkiller base passing through the shields, sure maybe it's because Han is awesome. But he says something like \"their shield use a fractal algorithm blah blah that'll let us pass through. So why not give the other fighters that info? The \"because shields\" is a weak story reason to get Finn and Han on the base. I offered a better reason: reconnaissance. \n\nI completely disagree about \"very capable enemies\". I'd say in this movie they are borderline incompetent. No one really fears Kylo Ren. Sure he'll Force-freeze you every now and then but everyone knows who he really is and he's only a threat because he's unstable. Yes, Leia mouthed off to Tarkin and Vader too, but she was also a politician. \n\nHere's a question: Finn floated to Han at one point the idea that there could be First Order spies in the Resistance. Well... Why aren't there? Surely this would make tactical sense! Swowing up in masks or stormtrooper armor only says \"I'm a baddy here to rob and kill you\". You won't get the droid that way. Sneak in as a friend, though, that could work. \n\nHow does the Resistance even know what's going on over where Maz is???\n\nAnd here's a stupid question: why do they leave the map in the droid? Po puts it there just fir safe keeping in the moment because they might capture him. But once you know that they want the droid, why not give the info to Maz or Chewie or something? You can rescue the droid later! \n\nAnd heck, Chewie saw the map too. Since the tracked the Falcon there, wouldn't they have searched it first? Why not take Chewie and mind rape him? Because Kylo Ren read the script.\n\nFinally, I am disappointed we didn't see the Knights of Ren. Why bot use them? \n\nWhen the base was destroyed, how many Firaf Order guys escaped? How bad were their casualties? Never mind how convenient it is that on this planet-sized base, everyone happens to be in the same 2-mile radius.

Here's my take on that: Yes Anakin did turn back to the Light at the very end and redeemed himself in the eyes of his son. But that one act does not wipe away the years of horrific things Anakin did. In The Truce at Bakura (a Legends book), Leia couldn't accept that the man who blew up her home planet was her father.
