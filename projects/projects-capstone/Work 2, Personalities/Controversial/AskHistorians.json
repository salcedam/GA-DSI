Napoleon's methods of imperial rule were far more ambiguous than that of Hitler's. Many Europeans under French rule sought to work with the Imperial system, whereas it was readily apparent  as early as 1940 that German suzerainty meant a loss of national sovereignty, an economy predicated upon serving the needs of Germany first, and overall offered nothing to Europeans in return. One Napoleon-related joke that circulated in Vichy captured this zeitgeist quite well. When in a gesture of goodwill, Germany returned the body of Napoleon's son, Napoleon II, a number of Frenchmen wagged \"the Germans have taken our coal, but we have gotten back the ashes.\" Napoleonic rule was harsh in many respects and seldom lived up to its Enlightenment ideals, but Europeans could, and did, accommodate to it with varying degrees of success. While French rule was generally unpopular, Nazi rule was decidedly loathed. The great historian of Napoleon Pieter Geyl wrote his opus *Napoleon: for and against* during the German occupation and even though he leaned towards against, he noted that there were elements of Napoleon's personality and charisma that swayed him. This type of attraction really does not hold sway for Hitler beyond racist circles, and pro-Hitler sentiments are usually a type of placeholder for right-wing sentiments. It has become something of an axiom in Napoleonic studies that comparing Napoleon to either Hitler or Stalin almost always ends up benefiting the Emperor. \n\nRather than go into the vagaries of French imperial rule, for this question it is useful to examine the image of Napoleon in  post-1815 literature in the arts. Napoleon's reputation underwent an odd trajectory in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries where he was first guardedly valorized and then denounced as a precursor to Hitler. \n\nNapoleon's reputation in the nineteenth century tended to be that of a great man with great ambitions. Even in Germany, where memories of French occupation were part of the legitimizing process, recreations of Napoleon in fiction tended to have a Janus-faced character. While the conqueror was reviled in the works of Louise Muhlbach, one of the bestselling German novel writers of this period, she praised his almost bourgeois domestic life and devotion to his family.  Although memories of the \"Corsican Ogre\" were still present in the Anglophone sphere, more sympathetic portrayals began to overshadow this negative picture of Napoleon. Both Carlyle and Walter Scott likened Napoleon to the great men of history whose own talents allowed them to remake the world in their own image. One of the woodcuts of Rebecca Sharp in  Thackaray's *Vanity Fair* depicted her with Napoleon's iconic *bicorne* suggesting her ambitions to get her way in romantic conquests. This sort of attraction to Napoleon was not hard to understand for Victorian audiences; the picture they presented of Napoleon was one who appeared to master various social forces and movements and harnessed them to his own ends. Given the radical changes brought about by industrialization, the magnetism of such a figure was obvious. Napoleon had something a cult-like status among the emerging class of American industrialists. J. P. Morgan as a young man wrote his thesis upon Napoleon and the American *nouveau riche* became important collectors of Napoleonic memorabilia and art. The department store magnate Alexander Stuart, for example, shocked the art world in 1876 by buying Meissonier's [*Friedland, 1807*](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437052) for a then unheard of price. \n\nBut this esteem and attraction for Napoleon did not mean that Europeans believed that the wrong side won in 1815. Rather, Napoleon's defeat and exile were the natural consequences of his hubris. Writers would often link Napoleon's obvious talents with his overarching ambition. When Napoleon appeared in Victorian juvenile fiction, it was often as a didactic warning against hubris. To be a \"Napoleon\" in Victorian society was to be a man who gave into the darker side of his own talents. A passage about Moriarty from Doyle's 1894 *The Memoir of Sherlock Holmes* illustrates this picture of Napoleon:\n\n>He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city, He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the center of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans.\n\nEven though Moriarty is an organizer of \"evil\", he is an ideal foil for Holmes. Beating a figure like Moriarty makes Holmes more heroic, which was a common narrative trope of British commemoration of their victories post-Waterloo. \n\nThe *Entente* alliance between Britain and France fostered a detente of sorts in Anglophone depictions of Napoleon. Boardman Robinson's cartoon [Napoleon and Wellington: this time we come side by side](https://www.granger.com/results.asp?inline=true&image=0099689&wwwflag=4&itemx=31&screenwidth=1600) evoked images of a spectral Napoleon and Wellington working side-by-side. The British press marked the centenary of Waterloo with praise for Napoleon and his legions and bemoaned the accident of fate that brought about conflict. But this highly complimentary vision of Napoleon was not to last into the interwar period. Not only had the arts and intellectual scene turned against \"great man\"-centric ideas (and this rejection had roots from well before the war- Nietzsche's writings on Napoleon stripped much of the mystique from him), but the wider zeitgeist had also turned against celebrating a man whose main accomplishments were military conquest. \n\nThe advent of Hitler meant that a negative depiction of Napoleon came to the fore in the interwar period. Wellington himself became the protagonist of the 1934 film *The Iron Duke* where he managed to save Europe from Napoleon despite the hindrance of unscrupulous politicians. The conquest of France heightened this depiction of Napoleon as a threat. The 1941 film *That Hamilton Woman* showed Nelson torn between his love of Emma and his duty, with duty winning out to the benefit of all of Europe. While the First World War denuded war of its glory for many, the Second World War cemented an image of Napoleon as an iteration of Hitler. \n\nThis less than complimentary portrait of Napoleon has proved quite lasting in postwar fiction. The postwar Napoleon is much a smaller figure and beset by various personal problems with the suggestion that he worked these out on the battlefield. Such pop-psychoanalyzing dovetailed with various theories on Hitler's behavior (i.e. \"Hitler had only one ball\", etc.). The 1954 film *D\u00e9sir\u00e9e*, featuring a very miscast Marlon Brando as Napoleon, shows him rejecting love in favor of ambition and the film's ending  framed this as an incorrect choice. Napoleon's alleged short height became fodder for jokes, as exemplified by the 1956 cartoon *Napoleon Bunny-Part* in which Napoleon enters into Bugs Bunny's rogues gallery of short-tempered fools outfoxed by the wiseacre hare. In strong contrast to Doyle's picture of Napoleon, the author Ian Fleming saw Napoleon's shortness as key to his behavior. In the novel *Goldfinger*, Felming writes:\n\n>Bond had always mistrusted short men. They grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex. All their lives they would strive to be bigger than others who had teased them as a child. Napoleon had been short, and Hitler.It was short men that created all the trouble in the world.\n\nWhile Doyle's superhero saw his mirror image in Moriarty's shade of Napoleon, Fleming's twentieth-century protagonist perceived  little in common with Napoleon and his short ilk. In *Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure*, Napoleon is short-tempered, cheats at bowling, and is fond of waterparks, which is quite far from Carlyle's great man as one can get.  \n\nEven sympathetic depictions of Napoleon had to balance  Napoleon as dictator. In the commercial flop *Waterloo*, Rod Steiger's Napoleon stomps around in his great coat and harangues his generals, again invoking Hitler, but the film gives him an inner voice that constantly expresses his doubts about his age and abilities. 2001's comedy *The Emperor's New Clothes*, Napoleon escapes from St. Helana and uses his firm military mind to restore the fortunes of a struggling green grocer he has fallen in love with, but the film ends **spoiler**  with him rejecting *gloire* and embracing love and being content with being a grocer **end spoiler**. \n\nThe cultural weight of this interwar and postwar depictions of Napoleon greatly outweigh the impact of the more nuanced view of Napoleon that most historians put out. Napoleon as Hitler's prequel has some sway in pop history circles or conservative public intellectuals like Paul Johnson, but within the academy the general stance on Napoleon is best described as \"constructively critical\" in which is fairly negative, but acknowledges his accomplishments (David Chandler, taking an earlier saying about Cromwell, called Napoleon \"that Great, Bad, Man\"). But this portrait of Napoleon has much less prominence among the public than the tiny, temper tantrum-prone general or Hitler:The Prequel.  This engenders a great deal of confusion when investigating the historical record of Napoleon and his rule, where he lives up to neither image.

Napoleon's reputation underwent an odd trajectory in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries where he was first guardedly valorized and then denounced as a precursor to Hitler. \n\nNapoleon's reputation in the nineteenth century tended to be that of a great man with great ambitions. Even in Germany, where memories of French occupation were part of the legitimizing process, recreations of Napoleon in fiction tended to have a Janus-faced character. While the conqueror was reviled in the works of Louise Muhlbach, one of the bestselling German novel writers of this period, she praised his almost bourgeois domestic life and devotion to his family.  Although memories of the \"Corsican Ogre\" were still present in the Anglophone sphere, more sympathetic portrayals began to overshadow this negative picture of Napoleon. Both Carlyle and Walter Scott likened Napoleon to the great men of history whose own talents allowed them to remake the world in their own image. One of the woodcuts of Rebecca Sharp in  Thackaray's *Vanity Fair* depicted her with Napoleon's iconic *bicorne* suggesting her ambitions to get her way in romantic conquests. This sort of attraction to Napoleon was not hard to understand for Victorian audiences; the picture they presented of Napoleon was one who appeared to master various social forces and movements and harnessed them to his own ends. Given the radical changes brought about by industrialization, the magnetism of such a figure was obvious. Napoleon had something a cult-like status among the emerging class of American industrialists. J. P. Morgan as a young man wrote his thesis upon Napoleon and the American *nouveau riche* became important collectors of Napoleonic memorabilia and art. The department store magnate Alexander Stuart, for example, shocked the art world in 1876 by buying Meissonier's [*Friedland, 1807*](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437052) for a then unheard of price. \n\nBut this esteem and attraction for Napoleon did not mean that Europeans believed that the wrong side won in 1815. Rather, Napoleon's defeat and exile were the natural consequences of his hubris. Writers would often link Napoleon's obvious talents with his overarching ambition. When Napoleon appeared in Victorian juvenile fiction, it was often as a didactic warning against hubris. To be a \"Napoleon\" in Victorian society was to be a man who gave into the darker side of his own talents. A passage about Moriarty from Doyle's 1894 *The Memoir of Sherlock Holmes* illustrates this picture of Napoleon:\n\n>He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city, He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the center of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans.\n\nEven though Moriarty is an organizer of \"evil\", he is an ideal foil for Holmes. Beating a figure like Moriarty makes Holmes more heroic, which was a common narrative trope of British commemoration of their victories post-Waterloo. \n\nThe *Entente* alliance between Britain and France fostered a detente of sorts in Anglophone depictions of Napoleon. Boardman Robinson's cartoon [Napoleon and Wellington: this time we come side by side](https://www.granger.com/results.asp?inline=true&image=0099689&wwwflag=4&itemx=31&screenwidth=1600) evoked images of a spectral Napoleon and Wellington working side-by-side. The British press marked the centenary of Waterloo with praise for Napoleon and his legions and bemoaned the accident of fate that brought about conflict. But this highly complimentary vision of Napoleon was not to last into the interwar period. Not only had the arts and intellectual scene turned against \"great man\"-centric ideas (and this rejection had roots from well before the war- Nietzsche's writings on Napoleon stripped much of the mystique from him), but the wider zeitgeist had also turned against celebrating a man whose main accomplishments were military conquest. \n\nThe advent of Hitler meant that a negative depiction of Napoleon came to the fore in the interwar period. Wellington himself became the protagonist of the 1934 film *The Iron Duke* where he managed to save Europe from Napoleon despite the hindrance of unscrupulous politicians. The conquest of France heightened this depiction of Napoleon as a threat. The 1941 film *That Hamilton Woman* showed Nelson torn between his love of Emma and his duty, with duty winning out to the benefit of all of Europe. While the First World War denuded war of its glory for many, the Second World War cemented an image of Napoleon as an iteration of Hitler. \n\nThis less than complimentary portrait of Napoleon has proved quite lasting in postwar fiction. The postwar Napoleon is much a smaller figure and beset by various personal problems with the suggestion that he worked these out on the battlefield. Such pop-psychoanalyzing dovetailed with various theories on Hitler's behavior (i.e. \"Hitler had only one ball\", etc.). The 1954 film *D\u00e9sir\u00e9e*, featuring a very miscast Marlon Brando as Napoleon, shows him rejecting love in favor of ambition and the film's ending  framed this as an incorrect choice. Napoleon's alleged short height became fodder for jokes, as exemplified by the 1956 cartoon *Napoleon Bunny-Part* in which Napoleon enters into Bugs Bunny's rogues gallery of short-tempered fools outfoxed by the wiseacre hare. In strong contrast to Doyle's picture of Napoleon, the author Ian Fleming saw Napoleon's shortness as key to his behavior. In the novel *Goldfinger*, Felming writes:\n\n>Bond had always mistrusted short men. They grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex. All their lives they would strive to be bigger than others who had teased them as a child. Napoleon had been short, and Hitler.It was short men that created all the trouble in the world.\n\nWhile Doyle's superhero saw his mirror image in Moriarty's shade of Napoleon, Fleming's twentieth-century protagonist perceived  little in common with Napoleon and his short ilk. In *Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure*, Napoleon is short-tempered, cheats at bowling, and is fond of waterparks, which is quite far from Carlyle's great man as one can get.  \n\nEven sympathetic depictions of Napoleon had to balance  Napoleon as dictator. In the commercial flop *Waterloo*, Rod Steiger's Napoleon stomps around in his great coat and harangues his generals, again invoking Hitler, but the film gives him an inner voice that constantly expresses his doubts about his age and abilities. 2001's comedy *The Emperor's New Clothes*, Napoleon escapes from St. Helana and uses his firm military mind to restore the fortunes of a struggling green grocer he has fallen in love with, but the film ends **spoiler**  with him rejecting *gloire* and embracing love and being content with being a grocer **end spoiler**. \n\nThe cultural weight of this interwar and postwar depictions of Napoleon greatly outweigh the impact of the more nuanced view of Napoleon that most historians put out. Napoleon as Hitler's prequel has some sway in pop history circles or conservative public intellectuals like Paul Johnson, but within the academy the general stance on Napoleon is best described as \"constructively critical\" in which is fairly negative, but acknowledges his accomplishments (David Chandler, taking an earlier saying about Cromwell, called Napoleon \"that Great, Bad, Man\"). But this portrait of Napoleon has much less prominence among the public than the tiny, temper tantrum-prone general or Hitler:The Prequel.  This engenders a great deal of confusion when investigating the historical record of Napoleon and his rule, where he lives up to neither image. ", "id": "d6aqh9b"}, {"comment": "Great answer. I'd like to add an interesting aspect. While we all know how Jews were treated under Hitler and Stalin, Napoleon is celebrated in Jewish history. He revoked old laws that confined Jews to ghettos, extended equal rights in regard to property and religious freedom, and even made Judaism an official religion (among others) of the French state.", "id": "d6arxta"}, {"comment": "Although a number of Napoleon's partisans like to point out his role in Jewish emancipation, his record on this matter, much like a lot of his policies, is quite ambiguous. Napoleon's Jewish policy evolved in the broader context of the Revolution and certain strains of  Enlightenment thought. \n\nIn the case of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Era, there was a strong tendency of the state to sweep aside many of the restrictive laws against Jews. This was of a piece with the Revolution's Enlightenment heritage which emphasized a rational legal and social order. The Enlightenment operated under a schema which postulated that disorder and crimes originated from imperfections within society. If Jews were associated with such activities like usury and swindling, then eliminating restrictive laws would end that activity. Very few Revolutionaries would turn the mirror on themselves and conclude that the Jews' negative image was the result of gentiles' own antisemitism; they took this antisemitic image of the Jew as an exploiter of gentiles as a given. The Revolution fostered the elimination of corporate privileges of the Jewish communities, largely clustered in the borders at Alsace, and made the tentative first steps towards accepting Jews as full citizens of France. The moderate liberal Stanislas Clermont-Tonnerre would argue in the National Assembly that:\n\n>We should refuse the Jews any rights as a separate nation, but grant them the same as individuals. They must not make in the State either a distinctive corps or an order. They must become individual citizens. \n\nSimilarly, the revolutionary firebrand Henri Gr\u00e9goire published a pamphlet in October 1789 favoring Jewish emancipation. Gr\u00e9goire's motions for Jewish emancipation received tentative support from other political actors like Mirabeau and Robespierre. In the latter case, the Jacobin leader saw the lack of Jewish integration into French culture as baleful legacy of the monarchical regime:\n\n>The vices of the Jews have their roots in the degradation into which you have plunged them. They will be good when they see some benefit in being so.\n\nYet the chaos of the Revolution's later stages meant that emancipation, which passed in the National Assembly in 27 September 1791, would be highly patchwork and incomplete.\n\nIt was up to Napoleon to complete this undone task. The Emperor shared much in common with Robespierre with regards to French Jews. In an 1806 letter to the Minister of the Interior, Napoleon would assert that the integrating the Jews into French society through social institutions like the army would eliminate any negative traits he associated with Judaism. The Emperor wrote that his goal in conscripting Jews was to remove:\n\n>the tendency of Jewish people to practice a very great number of activities that are harmful to civilization and to public order in society in all the countries of the world.\n\nIn the few state meetings that delved into the Jewish question, Napoleon would contend that the *ancien regime*'s classification of the Jews as a separate corporate entity only enabled the Jews' own worst vices. Like his Revolutionary predecessors, Napoleon did not question his own antisemitic precepts about Jews. And the emancipation of Jews throughout the Empire was incredibly uneven as the comparison between the Kingdom of Westphalia and the Duchy of Warsaw indicates. Both of these states were to be laboratories for Napoleonic methods of rule, but while Jerome's Westphalia did emancipate its Jews, the Duchy \"temporarily\" tabled emancipation even though its constitution was quite explicit on the matter. German emancipation was much easier for the French and *Rheinbund* states to accomplish because the processes of acculturation was well underway and Enlightenment ideas had also been percolating Europe for some time. The Austrian Emperor Joseph II had actually launched emancipation initiatives between 1781 and 1783. Poland, in contrast, Jews were still very much a separate estate with significant cultural, social, and legal barriers between Jews and gentiles. But despite the importance of *Aufklarung* circles in Germany, Jewish emancipation was deeply unpopular and emancipation statutes were among the first reforms to disappear in the German Confederation after 1815. \n\nIt is helpful to view Napoleon as  the culmination of the Revolution's Jewish policy rather than its instigator. Although the National Assembly had granted Jews full citizenship rights towards the end of its existence, the new revolutionary state also sought to subordinate and systematize Jewish religious and social institutions. Napoleon,  who was a systematizer *par excellence*, convened a council of Jewish elders, the Grand Sanhedrin, to declare that Jewish conscription was religiously valid. This followed other governmental attempts to regulate its Jewish community, ranging from religious dress or the state control over rabbis. Napoleon ushered in the French government's century-long attempt to subordinate religion to the state oversight and control. Although the French state also tried to subordinate the Catholic church to the state as well, Napoleonic and post-Napoleonic approaches to Judaism often treated Jews as community that needed to be corralled into \"correct\" behavior.  Berr Isaac Berr, the Alsatian Jewish delegate to the National Assembly, perceptively analyzed the antisemitism latent in these emancipatory initiatives in an 1806 pamphlet:\n\n>Hardly had the decree which granted Jews the title of citizen been handed down than they were reproached with not yet having become worthy as a group for this great favor. \n\nBerr's pamphlet prophesied many of the problems that Jews in France would face after the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Era. The systematizing and acculturating processes did turn a number of Jews into Frenchmen over the long term, but the larger acceptance of social antisemitism within the French gentile community acted as a counterweight to total integration. Sometimes  this discrepancy between legal and social realities would explode, as in the case of the Dreyfus Affair.\n\n*Sources* \n\nAston, Nigel. *Religion and Revolution in France, 1780-1804*.

This took me three hours to write and I was only able to do so because a lot of it I had heard before. Dealing with this gives me a headache, which I am sure applies to other contributors too. I can only urge to ask more specific questions and not just go \"What about these points?\" since that places a huge workload on people responding here and not all us can just take 3 hours out of a day to deal with this vomit inducing Holocaust denial bullshit.\n\nI have written extensively about this topic e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/57w1hh/monday_methods_holocaust_denial_and_how_to_combat/) in various forms and not only is it plausible that the Holocaust happened \u2013 the Holocaust did in fact happen.\n\nThe points this website raises are not good points. They are half-truths, things taken out of context and straight up lies. This will be longer so bear with me:\n\n> 1 Why are there survivors?\n\nFrom the standpoint of Nazi Germany, the Holocaust was a logistical and diplomatic effort that was also run according to economic considerations and considerations of internal policy. Countries like Hungary denied the Germans the deportation of their Jews up until 1944 because the Horthy Regime e.g. was not on board with sending their citizens to their deaths. Additionally, in line with the economic considerations that played a role, the German regime responded to how the war was going. After conclusion of Operation Reinhard, the murder of the Jews in Poland, and Auschwitz becoming the sole center for mass murder, this turn in policy result in, among other things, more Jews being selected for the purpose of forced labor for the German war machine. They were either to be worked to death or to work before they were killed. The most prominent example for this being Auschwitz Monowitz, where people worked for the IG Farben industries but they were also regularly \"selected\" for the gas chamber if they became too weak etc. When Soviet troops threatened Auschwitz, they send the prisoners on death marches with the purpose of either using them further for forced labor and/or killing them as /u/kieslowskifan describes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3vmm9t/why_did_the_nazis_care_so_much_about_destroying/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3qonin/why_didnt_nazi_germany_kill_all_the_people_in/).\n\nPeople were able to survive this, just as people were able to hide from the Nazis, flee the camps, join the Partisans or were rescued by people or in the case of Denmark, which evacuated virtually all their Jews to Sweden, by their government. The number of Holocaust survivors often given today and also given by this website, includes people who did not survive the camps per se but also those who fled, were hidden etc. as I discuss [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/549oah/holocaust_questions/)\n\n> 2 The Holocaust being mentioned in war time memories\n\nThis is typical behavior for deniers: An outright lie that sounds plausible but when you look closer it quickly dissolves in front of your eyes. I don't have Eisenhower or DeGaulle at hand but in volume VI of *The Second World War* p. 693 Churchill has this letter of his to Eden concerning the Holocaust:\n\n> Prime Minister to Foreign Secretary [Anthony Eden], July 11, 1944\n>\n> There is no doubt that this is probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world, and it has been done by scientific machinery by nominally civilized men in the name of a great State and one of the leading races of Europe. It is quite clear that all concerned in this crime who may fall into our hands, including the people who only obeyed orders by carrying out the butcheries, should be put to death...\n\nFurthermore, Eisenhower after he personally visited liberated camps cabled General George C. Marshall, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, describing his trip to the liberated Ohrdruf camp:\n\n> . . .the most interesting\u2014although horrible\u2014sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha. The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to \u201cpropaganda.\u201d \n\n\n\n> 3 What was an inmate infirmary (and a brothel) doing in Auschwitz if in fact it was a death camp? \n\nAuschwitz served both as a concentration and a death camp, most notably in being organized into the Stammlager (Auschwitz I) and Birkenau (Auschwitz II) as well as another concentration and forced labor camp (Auschwitz III Monowitz). Especially in the Stammlager, Auschwitz held massive amounts of non-Jewish prisoners, from Polish communists and Catholics to other political opponents of Nazism from all over Europe.\n\nFurthermore, the infirmary was not primarily \u2013 as is suggested here \u2013 a place to take good medical care of prisoners. It was a place for doctors to conduct their experiments and as we know from several official documents as well as recollections of Nazis and prisoners, a place were regular selections, i.e. sending sick prisoners to the gas chambers, took place. It was more of a place to put sick prisoners in order to prevent infectious disease, which could affect the guards, spreading in the camps.\n\nAs for the brothel, this has to do with the insidious way, the Nazis structured their camps, namely that mostly German political or criminal prisoners were put in charge of certain administrative tasks as well as certain work detachments, mostly because the Concentration Camps in general ran on a very thin German staff (the principle of economics involved here). Brothels were a way to incentivize the so-called Kapos who received vouchers to visit the brothels staffed with female prisoners. Furthermore, they were often frequented by the guards themselves.\n\n> 4 Why round them up and not shot them on the spot?\n\nAside the fact that a lot of Jews, namely those in the Soviet Union, were indeed shot on the spot, the method of centralized killing in the camps had various factors at its basis. 1. The experience by the Einsatzgruppen showed that it was more effort to travel around and organize huge mass shootings than it was to deport them to centralized camps. 2. Himmler found that shooting so many people had a negative psychological impact on the perpetrators and gassing did have less so. 3. Just shooting people could have lead to problems with governments in certain countries and could have lead to mass protests (e.g. in Belgium, France or the Netherlands), which could have required more effort to put down than the deportations. 4. In 1941 public protests by the Germans had forced the Nazi government to shut down the T4 killing program, something they wanted to avoid with the program aimed at Jews, thus the need for a certain secrecy. This was confirmed by the Rosenstra\u00dfe protests when the German spouses of Jews forced the Nazi government to back down from their plan to deport said Jews in 1943. 5. As I describe [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ayc7x/how_much_did_the_resources_invested_in/) deportation and centralized killing was what made the most sense logistically and economically.\n\n> 5 Why after sixty years have historians not been able to come up with a single German document that points to a Holocaust? \n\nThere is a plethora of documents that points to the Holocaust, including a lot of testimony that points to an oral order for it given by Hitler. I have written about this in further detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4fcte0/what_is_the_concensus_on_the_weak_dictator_theory/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/59mnlx/how_do_we_know_that_hitler_himself_ordered_the/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ac6ww/what_is_the_method_of_calculating_the_murder_of/) (look especially to the Korherr Report and the Einsatzgruppen reports)\n"], [18, "Hi! As this question pertains to basic, underlying facts of the Holocaust, I hope you can appreciate that it can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we want people to get the answers they are looking for, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of response. As such, this message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as Holocaust Denial, and provide a short list of introductory reading. There is always more than can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\n\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\n\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\n\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\n\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was a vast complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\n\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.\n\n##Further Reading\n\n* \"[Third Reich Trilogy](https://books.google.com/books?id=HZmXOPGTGjIC)\" by Richard Evans\n* \"[Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7FiPwAACAAJ)\" by Ian Kershaw\n* \"[Auschwitz: A New History](https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-dZEV228QC)\" by Laurence Rees\n* \"[Ordinary Men](https://books.google.com/books?id=HFB-dkuZzSwC)\" by Christopher Browning\n* \"[Denying History](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-0B9-D5Vz4C)\" by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman\n* [AskHistorians FAQ](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwii#wiki_nazi_germany)\n"], [6, "You may also be interested in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/57w1hh/monday_methods_holocaust_denial_and_how_to_combat/) on Holocaust denial.

I can only urge to ask more specific questions and not just go \"What about these points?\" since that places a huge workload on people responding here and not all us can just take 3 hours out of a day to deal with this vomit inducing Holocaust denial bullshit.\n\nI have written extensively about this topic e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/57w1hh/monday_methods_holocaust_denial_and_how_to_combat/) in various forms and not only is it plausible that the Holocaust happened \u2013 the Holocaust did in fact happen.\n\nThe points this website raises are not good points. They are half-truths, things taken out of context and straight up lies. This will be longer so bear with me:\n\n> 1 Why are there survivors?\n\nFrom the standpoint of Nazi Germany, the Holocaust was a logistical and diplomatic effort that was also run according to economic considerations and considerations of internal policy. Countries like Hungary denied the Germans the deportation of their Jews up until 1944 because the Horthy Regime e.g. was not on board with sending their citizens to their deaths. Additionally, in line with the economic considerations that played a role, the German regime responded to how the war was going. After conclusion of Operation Reinhard, the murder of the Jews in Poland, and Auschwitz becoming the sole center for mass murder, this turn in policy result in, among other things, more Jews being selected for the purpose of forced labor for the German war machine. They were either to be worked to death or to work before they were killed. The most prominent example for this being Auschwitz Monowitz, where people worked for the IG Farben industries but they were also regularly \"selected\" for the gas chamber if they became too weak etc. When Soviet troops threatened Auschwitz, they send the prisoners on death marches with the purpose of either using them further for forced labor and/or killing them as /u/kieslowskifan describes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3vmm9t/why_did_the_nazis_care_so_much_about_destroying/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3qonin/why_didnt_nazi_germany_kill_all_the_people_in/).\n\nPeople were able to survive this, just as people were able to hide from the Nazis, flee the camps, join the Partisans or were rescued by people or in the case of Denmark, which evacuated virtually all their Jews to Sweden, by their government. The number of Holocaust survivors often given today and also given by this website, includes people who did not survive the camps per se but also those who fled, were hidden etc. as I discuss [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/549oah/holocaust_questions/)\n\n> 2 The Holocaust being mentioned in war time memories\n\nThis is typical behavior for deniers: An outright lie that sounds plausible but when you look closer it quickly dissolves in front of your eyes. I don't have Eisenhower or DeGaulle at hand but in volume VI of *The Second World War* p. 693 Churchill has this letter of his to Eden concerning the Holocaust:\n\n> Prime Minister to Foreign Secretary [Anthony Eden], July 11, 1944\n>\n> There is no doubt that this is probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world, and it has been done by scientific machinery by nominally civilized men in the name of a great State and one of the leading races of Europe. It is quite clear that all concerned in this crime who may fall into our hands, including the people who only obeyed orders by carrying out the butcheries, should be put to death...\n\nFurthermore, Eisenhower after he personally visited liberated camps cabled General George C. Marshall, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, describing his trip to the liberated Ohrdruf camp:\n\n> . . .the most interesting\u2014although horrible\u2014sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha. The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to \u201cpropaganda.\u201d \n\n\n\n> 3 What was an inmate infirmary (and a brothel) doing in Auschwitz if in fact it was a death camp? \n\nAuschwitz served both as a concentration and a death camp, most notably in being organized into the Stammlager (Auschwitz I) and Birkenau (Auschwitz II) as well as another concentration and forced labor camp (Auschwitz III Monowitz). Especially in the Stammlager, Auschwitz held massive amounts of non-Jewish prisoners, from Polish communists and Catholics to other political opponents of Nazism from all over Europe.\n\nFurthermore, the infirmary was not primarily \u2013 as is suggested here \u2013 a place to take good medical care of prisoners. It was a place for doctors to conduct their experiments and as we know from several official documents as well as recollections of Nazis and prisoners, a place were regular selections, i.e. sending sick prisoners to the gas chambers, took place. It was more of a place to put sick prisoners in order to prevent infectious disease, which could affect the guards, spreading in the camps.\n\nAs for the brothel, this has to do with the insidious way, the Nazis structured their camps, namely that mostly German political or criminal prisoners were put in charge of certain administrative tasks as well as certain work detachments, mostly because the Concentration Camps in general ran on a very thin German staff (the principle of economics involved here). Brothels were a way to incentivize the so-called Kapos who received vouchers to visit the brothels staffed with female prisoners. Furthermore, they were often frequented by the guards themselves.\n\n> 4 Why round them up and not shot them on the spot?\n\nAside the fact that a lot of Jews, namely those in the Soviet Union, were indeed shot on the spot, the method of centralized killing in the camps had various factors at its basis. 1. The experience by the Einsatzgruppen showed that it was more effort to travel around and organize huge mass shootings than it was to deport them to centralized camps. 2. Himmler found that shooting so many people had a negative psychological impact on the perpetrators and gassing did have less so. 3. Just shooting people could have lead to problems with governments in certain countries and could have lead to mass protests (e.g. in Belgium, France or the Netherlands), which could have required more effort to put down than the deportations. 4. In 1941 public protests by the Germans had forced the Nazi government to shut down the T4 killing program, something they wanted to avoid with the program aimed at Jews, thus the need for a certain secrecy. This was confirmed by the Rosenstra\u00dfe protests when the German spouses of Jews forced the Nazi government to back down from their plan to deport said Jews in 1943. 5. As I describe [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ayc7x/how_much_did_the_resources_invested_in/) deportation and centralized killing was what made the most sense logistically and economically.\n\n> 5 Why after sixty years have historians not been able to come up with a single German document that points to a Holocaust? \n\nThere is a plethora of documents that points to the Holocaust, including a lot of testimony that points to an oral order for it given by Hitler. I have written about this in further detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4fcte0/what_is_the_concensus_on_the_weak_dictator_theory/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/59mnlx/how_do_we_know_that_hitler_himself_ordered_the/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ac6ww/what_is_the_method_of_calculating_the_murder_of/) (look especially to the Korherr Report and the Einsatzgruppen reports)\n", "id": "dahi1wg"}, {"comment": "> 6 The number of Jews killed at Auschwitz varying\n\nI have answered this before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4gmxqm/why_the_count_six_million_still_persists_when_the/): The 4 million number originated with the combined Polish-Soviet commission to examine the crimes committed at the Auschwitz camps. They arrived at this number by taking the maximum capacity of the crematoria at Auschwitz over the whole time of their operation and extrapolating the numbers from that, reducing it by 20% because they assumed that 20% of operation's time needs to account for down time. What the Soviet-Polish commission didn't account for was that not all the Auschwitz crematoria operated at full capacity every day of their existence. This number was immediately recognized as too high, as can be seen from the Polish court that tried Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df that assumed H\u00f6\u00df as the commandant in Auschwitz was responsible for 2.8 million deaths rather than 4 million. Also, in Western academia, since Gerard Reitlinger's publication of his book The Final Solution. Reitlinger estimated that about 1 million Jews had been killed at Auschwitz rather precisely. The 4 million number stayed around because it became socialist propaganda credo in order to prove how the Eastern European nations had suffered especially under fascist rule.\n\nIn an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on September 14, 1989, the director of the State Museum of Auschwitz said that the State Museum of Auschwitz had to give the number of victims with 2.8 to 4 million because the socialist state authorities regarded those as \"the most likely numbers\" and they were practically mandated to.\n\nSo, the 4 million number was never accepted in Western academia as the right number of victims of Auschwitz. Summing up, a number of around 6 million victims has been and stayed given as the approximately exact number of Jewish victims of the Holocaust since pretty much the 50s. Even with the new evidence uncovered through the opening of the Eastern European archives, where for example evidence about the previously almost unknown camp of Maly Trostinec where 60.000 people were killed, was uncovered, the number has stayed about the same through all these historical revisions.\n\n> 7 All of Germany's wartime codes were compromised including the ones used to send daily reports from Auschwitz to Berlin. The transcripts of these messages make no mention of mass executions or even remotely suggest a genocidal program in progress.  ...\n\nThis again, is some kind of half-truth. The British intercepted reports send from Auschwitz to Berlin for the period of 13 months from  1942-3 and after that point in time, the Nazis stopped sending reports via these channels and switched to telephone reports. These reports give the number of people registered at the camp, not the number of people of people gassed in the camp upon arrival since these people were never registered (because why register people that were killed immediately?). Furthermore, there are intercepted messages that detail the genocidal program in progress: The Einsatzgruppen Reports, which can be read [here](http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/einsatz/situationreport.html), which for example contain the following passage from Einsatzgruppen Situational Report 128 of November 2nd, 1941:\n\n> Several retaliatory measures were carried out as large-scale actions. The largest of these actions took place immediately after the occupation of Kiev. It was carried out exclusively against Jews and their entire families. (...) Even though approximately 75,000 Jews have been liquidated in this manner, it is evident at this time that this cannot be the best solution of the Jewish problem. Although we succeeded, particularly in smaller towns and villages, in bringing about a complete liquidation of the Jewish problem, nevertheless, again and again it has been observed in the larger cities that after such an action, all Jews have indeed been eradicated.\n\nFurthermore, the use of code language among the Nazis had a variety of reason, aside some measure of secrecy from the German public (see above concerning T4 and Rosenstra\u00dfe), in that context it was a measure of plausible deniability as well as way to make it easier among the perpetrators to separate themselves from these actions.\n\n\n> 8 water table at Auschwitz\n\nFrom Nizkor Project: \"During the period in which Auschwitz was active, the SS had the area drained; as can be seen today, the drainage, which has not been maintained since 1945, has deteriorated and the water level had risen. Furthermore, the ditches were not used all the time, but only when there were not enough furnaces to cremate the victims or during the extermination of the Hungarian Jews, when so many people were murdered daily that the furnaces could not handle the amount of corpses. The \"incineration ditches\" are known to have been active in October-November 1942 and the summer of 1944, which do not coincide with the period the snow melts and the water level rises.\"\n\n[Here](http://voiceseducation.org/sites/default/files/images/auschwitz-burning-pit-3-1944.jpg) is a picture of such a burning pit.\n\n> 9 Gas chambers in the Reich and Poland\n\nAgain, the half-truths. There were homicidal gas chambers within the camps on Reich territory, notably in the case of Mauthausen e.g. The key here is that the gas chambers in the Reich were not used to the extent of mass killing in the Holocaust but rather as part of \"regular\" killing operations in the camps, such as the Kugelaktion where Soviet POW officers were killed in Mauthausen and other camps. With the renewed interest in the subject in the 60s historians uncovered more evidence to that effect that not only made the difference between these camps clearer but also complicated some cases such as that of [Dachau Baracke X](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2xegsc/why_was_dachaus_gas_chamber_never_used_in_mass/)\n\n> 10 entering the gas chamber and Zyklon B\n\nThe gas chambers had a ventilation system and Zyklon B is in contradiction to what this dolt writes on his website highly volatile when dissolved into a gas. More on this in Robert Jan Van Pelt's [Reports on the gas chambers](https://www.hdot.org/vanpelt_toc/) for the Irving v. Lipstadt trial\n\n>  11 Why do we no longer hear the claims that the Germans manufactured soap, lamp shades and riding britches from the bodies of dead Jews?\n\nBecause in many cases Historians have uncovered that these claims were based either on rumors or not entirely accurate. Yet, as can be gleaned from [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3u75fd/did_the_nazis_ever_actually_make_soap_out_of/) by myself and others, these claims are true to an extent in that the Nazis did produce soap and shrunken heads albeit not in the extent that was claimed earlier.\n", "id": "dahi24u"}, {"comment": "> 12 electricution and steam chambers\n\nContrary to the claim of the webstie, this was not evidence that sent men to the gallows. While there were indeed electrocutions on a limited basis, the system proved not effectual enough for the Nazis. The use of wide spread electricution and steam chambers were based on rumors and as can be gleaned from the transcript of the IMT trial, treated as such.\n\n> 13 Ellie Wiesel and the gas chambers\n\nEllie Wiesel's memoirs make no mention of the gas chambers at Auschwitz because Ellie Wiesel did not see or interact with the gas chambers. If he would mention them, dolts like the wirter of this website would cry \"but he didn't see the gas chambers !!!!1!!!eleven\"\n\n> 14 Virtually every survivor who was examined at Auschwitz says he or she was examined by Dr. Joseph Mengele. \n\nBlatantly untrue. Case in point: Hermann Langbein in his book about Auschwitz *People in Auschwitz* makes no such claim. Similarly, many of the survivors testifying against doctors in Auschwitz at the German Auschwitz trial also did testify similarly.\n\n> 15 According to survivor testimony, hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed at Treblinka and then buried in mass graves in the surrounding area. Why is it that extensive sonar probing of these burial grounds reveals that this final resting place for Holocaust victims has remained undisturbed since at least the last ice age?\n\nAgain, blatantly untrue. First of all, if you build stuff somewhere, it is not \"undisturbed since the last ice age\" and secondly [mass graves have been found and unearthed at Treblinka as recently as 2014](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16657363).\n\n> 16 \"Proof\" of the Holocaust rests largely on survivor testimony; \n\nAgain, untrue. There is extensive German documentary evidence such as the Korherr Report and others, there are material remains as described in the Van Pelt report linked above and there are the mass graves unearthed at Treblinka and also at Sobibor as described in the article linked above.\n\n> 17  Why has Holocaust Revisionism been criminalized in at least eleven countries?\n\nI go into this in depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4hrvlh/why_is_historical_revisionism_a_crime_in_certain/) and the TL;DR is European countries outlaw Holocaust denial directly or indirectly because as a form of political agitation, it poses a social and political thread to the established democratic order as well as to the social peace in these countries. Both are legal and historical sufficient reasons to outlaw this specific form of speech under the \"pressing social need\" exception, laid out by various constitutional courts and the European Human Rights court.\n\n> 18 The leading Revisionists are first-rate scholars who hold advanced degrees from the world's leading universities. Is there anyone comparable among those who would say the earth is flat or that slavery never existed? \n\nhahahahahah. I'd be incredibly curious to hear who these first rate scholars with degrees from top universities are. David Irving didn't finish his studies and was at best, a journalist. Faurrisson was a literary scholar and apparently a bad one at that. Ernst Z\u00fcndel is a graphic artist and printer. Fred Leuchter has a BA in history but claimed to be an engineer. These people are a lot of things but top scholars they ain't.\n\n> 19 Promoters of the Holocaust have expressed concern about remembering the Holocaust once the last survivors die. Why haven't Civil War historians expressed similar concerns since the last survivor of that conflict died in 1959? \n\nWhile the claim that they didn't is still in the category of [citation needed], there is the factor that how historians work have changed since 1959 and the inclusion of first hand narratives through interviews and other forms of testimony has risen to a more prominent place within historical academia since 1959.\n", "id": "dahi2ef"}, {"comment": "> 20 Properly operating crematoria do not emit smoke\n\nReally? Then why do they have smock stacks? Modern crematoria might not emit as much smoke when burning bodies but those in the 1940s sure did. Furthermore, while today carbon sequestering and regulation of combustion industries might make what little smoke is produced today hardly noticeable, neither the technology nor the regulations existed in the case of the death camps. [Here](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/arts/2004/01/19/auschwitz256.jpg?w=620&q=20&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=b1759f20e1e1c5795e8dc3e54c816cdc) is a photograph taken by US aerial reconnaissance showing the smoke at Auschwitz.\n\n> 21 Hungarian Jews and smoke\n\nThe above photo should cover that claim of the huge smoke stacks and such mass graves have been found and described by the Soviets who liberated the camp.\n\n> 22 All of the liberated camps were littered with corpses; is there a single autopsy report or any other forensic evidence that shows that even a single death was as a consequence of poison gas?\n\nThis is starting to give me a headache. The people gassed in the chambers were cremated afterwards. Gassing operations at most camps ceased at the latest when the Allies were approaching and as in the case of Auschwitz, the chambers and crematoria were destroyed and/or dismantled. The corpses found by the Allies were the corpses of prisoners and victims of death marches, most of whom died of lack of food and water or diseases as well as those who were killed by the guards before the Allies arrived. Those who died of gassing (and not all camps used Zyklon B, the Reinhard Camps used diesel engines) had died before the Allies arrived and their bodies had been destroyed.\n\n> 23 The death toll for the Holocaust lies exclusively on population statistics provided by Jewish sources\n\nAgain, blatantly untrue. As I describe [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ac6ww/what_is_the_method_of_calculating_the_murder_of/), the method to calculate the deaths is one that uses population statistics supplied by national governments, Nazi German sources and investigations by such bodies like the UN. No \"Jewish sources\", whatever that is supposed to be, are involved.\n\n> 24 Why do the wartime inspection reports of the camps made by the International Red Cross contain no references to mass executions?\n\nBecause the Nazis didn't show these executions to the Red Cross and the Red Cross was not allowed to visit death camps. Furthermore, the ICRC had some knowledge of the crimes the Nazis did commit but chose not to publish them to the public for fear that they would not allowed be back into Germany to help those they were inc charge of helping as described by Jean-Claude Favez in his book *The Red Cross and the Holocaust*\n\n>  25 Why has there been no effort to respond to the Leuchter report? \n\nThere has been and it has been debunked. One such effort can be found [here](https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab12-leutcher-report/)\n\n26 I am not even going to address since it is such bullshit, it doesn't warrant a response.\n\n> 27 What other historical truths rely to the extent that the Holocaust does rely on eyewitness testimony, and why have none of these eyewitnesses every been cross examined?\n\nThe reconstruction of several historical events up to and including the American response to the Cuban Missile Crisis and 9/11 rely to a certain extent on eyewitness testimony because that is not something unusual. Furthermore, in many a trial concerning the Holocaust, from the IMT to the Auschwitz trial in Germany, witnesses have been cross examined.\n\nAnd finally, 28 I am also not going to address because it relies on an anti-Semitic notion of conspiracy that is so far out of the realm of truth that a response going beyond that seems unnecessary.\n", "id": "dahi2i8"}, {"comment": "Wow, thanks for an incredibly detailed response.

As this question pertains to basic, underlying facts of the Holocaust, I hope you can appreciate that it can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we want people to get the answers they are looking for, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of response. As such, this message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as Holocaust Denial, and provide a short list of introductory reading. There is always more than can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\n\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\n\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\n\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\n\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was a vast complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\n\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony.

Under which the ownership of the land was taken away from the peasants and given to zamindars (landlords) and peasants were made tenants of their own lands. \n\nDecision to recognize zamindars as proprietors of land was was aimed at creating a buffer class between them and the people of india. As company knew they were foreigners in india and would need political allies to maintain their power and order. So they brought into existence a wealthy and priviledged class which owed its existence to british rule and which would be compelled by its own basic interests to support it. This expectation also got justified when the zamindars as a class supported the foreign government in opposition to rising freedom movements.\n\nTo answer the second part, from the above text it might look like it was a win win situation for zamindars but in actuality it was a different scenario. Zamindars even after being the owners of the land had to pay 10/11th of the total revenue to the britishers and were forced to sell their lands when they failed to generate the revenue previously decided which used to be very high. Almost half of the zamindari lands were sold between 1794 and 1807. Because of this, there was a big group of zamindars who started disliking british government and later sided with the freedom revolutionaries. Also some of the elites like motilal Nehru who weren't much against britishers before but after many acts of torture by the british government on indian people especially the jallianwala bach massacre led to the change in their belief and made the spirit of freedom stronger.\n\nAnd NO, no financial gain was promised to them. But if you look at the practical point, the elites knew that when the britishers will leave the country, a huge space will be left in administration and other powerful posts and since lower classes were deprived of education and resources, they are the only ones who'll be getting these posts. Also after independence, when govt. of India started land reforms and decided to abolish zamindari system and give back the land to peasants,  the bureaucrats who were sent to the villages to carry out the orders and redistribute the land also belonged to elite class as they were the only educated ones at that time and they grossly misused their powers. So, elites who didn't have the security of the land the owned under the british rule , now were very much satisfied with the present scenario.\n\nSorry for making it so lengthy.

There are two basic roots of the division medieval western Christians drew between \"white\" and \"black\": geographical and moral. The first thing to keep in mind is that the two strands of 'racial' thought develop hand-in-hand, inseparable from each other. The second is that theories of race will *never* be neat packages and will always appear to have contradictions all over the place, because they are ideologies-in-practice and not scientific laws.\n\nMedieval Latins had a lot of ways of mentally comprehending the Earth's geography, but by the 12th century there were two major ones. First, the idea of dividing the earth basically into 3 continents a la the T-O maps: Asia to the east, with Europe in the northwest and Africa in the southwest. This partnered neatly in Christian thought with the religious idea of contemporary humanity as the descendants of the three sons of Noah. The second, which the West gets from ancient Greece I believe by way of medieval Muslim writers (who draw on this particular view as well), is based on the ancient Greek idea of climatological zones dictating people's appearance and, eventually, behavior.\n\nThe two strands of racialized geographic thought entangle to push forward the same idea: people from the south (Africa) are black because it is warm/the sun makes it hot/they have warmer humors; people from the north (Europe and sometimes northern Asia) are white because it is cold/they have colder humors. Note that climatological determinism does not, *inherently*, have a moralized component. For example, Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun associates the darker skin of sub-Saharan Africans with exposure to a hotter sun, not any kind of moral difference.\n\nBut throughout the Middle Ages, western Europe was developing strong associations between \"white\" skin and goodness, \"black\" skin and badness. The *direct* ties between Ham:curse:black skin are not entirely clear or straightforward. Indeed, central European nobles will interpret the story of the curse to tarnish their own *serfs* and justify their lack of freedom; the extent to which the \"dark\" and \"darkener\" imagery tied to the curse on Ham mean skin color varies throughout medieval writing.\n\nBut that shouldn't obscure a couple of basic facts. First, western Europe definitely had the theory that people from 'the south' were black; western Europe definitely had strong moral meanings attached to white and black. And those moral meanings became tied up in skin color very quickly.\n\nFor example, we can see a movement to allegorize the Ham:south:heat connection as early as Jerome (late antiquity), picked up by early medieval authors and then the high medieval encyclopedists who will set the 'discourse on race'. Ham is hot, writes Jerome. To Rabanus Maurus (9th century), the heat of Ham represents the \"primordial passions of the Jews and heretics, which disturb the peace of the holy.\"\n\nBut white and black are as allegorized in medieval thought as heat and coolness: white is good and heavenly; black is bad and demonic. Dark devils populate the illuminations of medieval manuscripts; heaven's angels glow white and pure.\n\nIn 6C, Gregory the Great describes seeing boys from England on sale at a slave market in Marseilles. Their pale coloration, he says, reminds him of angels (Angles/angels), and so the boys must be heirs of the angels in heaven. \n\nAnd above all, whether the idea of black skin, hot climates/the south/Africa, and badness get tied together in the European imagination, is in the discourse in literary and proto-scientific texts on Islam and Muslims.\n\nThe black skin of Saracens is *all over* medieval literature, and it's moralized to hell and back. The *Estoria de Espana* describes the terrible, conquering Saracens: \"their faces were black as pitch, the most handsome among them was black as a kettle, their eyes shone like candles.\" The text of the *Song of Roland* and its derivatives carries the tradition far. Abisme is \"black as pitch\" and \"This Saracen seems quite heretical; it would be much better if I were to kill him,\" notes the archbishop.\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of the medieval association of white:white skin:goodness and black:black skin:badness comes from the 14th century *Cursor Mundi*. In this text, when the black Saracens convert to Christianity, *their skin becomes \"white as milk.\"*\n\nThe writers of natural philosophy in the climatological tradition pick up on this moral discourse. Scholars like Bartholemew Angelicus put a lot of effort into drawing out how hot climates make *black*, short, cowardly, violent people in contrast to the cold climate that produces *white*, strong, courageous men. I switch between *people* and *men* here quite on purpose. Medieval Europeans couldn't make up their minds whether the violent/barbaric \"black Saracen\" nature overwhelmed passive feminity--the Moorish princess character in medieval romances glides between having her boorishness go unremarked because Saracen *duh*, or condemned as unfeminine.\n\nSo by the time Europe's sailors are pushing beyond the Mediterranean and North Sea, the ties between geography, skin color, and morality are *well* entrenched thanks to centuries of writing incubated in and by cultural ties and religious antagonism with Muslims.\n\nThe highly problematic modern discourse of race as skin color that really doesn't reflect the \"actual colors\" of people's skin gets a lot of attention today. White and black people are not white and black. I want to point out that the Middle Ages--and earlier--operated with exactly the same messiness. The Vulgate Latin translation of the Song of Songs (Hebrew Bible), for example, has the 'bride' character who has spent too much time in the fields and gotten tan describe herself as \"I am black but beautiful.\" \n\nAnd the manuscript evidence is even more striking. The 13th century Spanish manuscript known as the *Book of Games* portrays dark-skinned [Muslim men](http://i.imgur.com/minPqpf.jpg), light-skinned [Muslim men](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Moors_from_Andalusia_playing_chess.jpg), and light-skinned [Muslim women](http://i.imgur.com/k9gyoCq.jpg).

It was during the Civil Rights movement that they became called 'black', by choice of the African American population.\n\nSo in short, the label black was not a pejorative, it actually derived from the preference of the Civil Rights community during the 1960s and not to dehumanize them.

Scholars like Bartholemew Angelicus put a lot of effort into drawing out how hot climates make *black*, short, cowardly, violent people in contrast to the cold climate that produces *white*, strong, courageous men. I switch between *people* and *men* here quite on purpose. Medieval Europeans couldn't make up their minds whether the violent/barbaric \"black Saracen\" nature overwhelmed passive feminity--the Moorish princess character in medieval romances glides between having her boorishness go unremarked because Saracen *duh*, or condemned as unfeminine.\n\nSo by the time Europe's sailors are pushing beyond the Mediterranean and North Sea, the ties between geography, skin color, and morality are *well* entrenched thanks to centuries of writing incubated in and by cultural ties and religious antagonism with Muslims.\n\nThe highly problematic modern discourse of race as skin color that really doesn't reflect the \"actual colors\" of people's skin gets a lot of attention today. White and black people are not white and black. I want to point out that the Middle Ages--and earlier--operated with exactly the same messiness. The Vulgate Latin translation of the Song of Songs (Hebrew Bible), for example, has the 'bride' character who has spent too much time in the fields and gotten tan describe herself as \"I am black but beautiful.\" \n\nAnd the manuscript evidence is even more striking. The 13th century Spanish manuscript known as the *Book of Games* portrays dark-skinned [Muslim men](http://i.imgur.com/minPqpf.jpg), light-skinned [Muslim men](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Moors_from_Andalusia_playing_chess.jpg), and light-skinned [Muslim women](http://i.imgur.com/k9gyoCq.jpg).

You went more directly from the OP to the specific label of \"black\" in modern English; I went more broadly for how white people came to define groups of people by assumed skin color and ascribed moral implications to the differences.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right that the black community claims \"black\" or \"Black\" in the 1960s, although the term has spotty usage even in English going back centuries. Winthrop Jordan and Halford Fairchild both jump right to the notion that white people tagged Africans (in Africa; pre-Civil War the term is used here, too, a la African Methodist Episcopal church) and their descendants in the U.S. as \"black\" to draw the biggest possible distinction between the two groups and play on the power of the inherent negative symbolism of darkness in general. So around the time of the Civil War, there were some people who batted around the idea of claiming a black identity for themselves but this didn't catch on.\n\nThe story of the specific labels, who claims what and why, and who tries to lay onto others what and why, and the different arguments put forth as to why various labels matter are a *great* window into black (...) history. Just take W.E.B.

Forgive me, then, for asking such an obviously pointed question and bastardizing your excellent response (but I'd rather just ask than try to soften it): did Europeans, in some conscious or intentional way, apply the allegory of Ham and their historical associations with blackness to Africans in order to make it \"easier\" to enslave them, or was it really more of a conditioned response to their preconceptions of blackness based on the history you talked about?

I'm not sure you can draw simple cause-effect either way; they feed into each other in a vicious spiral. Winthrop Jordan, who's done some of the most important and influential work on this, found an enormous swath of anti-African/black writing in late 16/early 17C England that bleeds right into the earliest British settlers in North America who dragged African probably-slaves (their status is legally ambiguous) with them. But even in the same book as he made that forceful case, Jordan also promoted his earlier argument that slavery and racism really produced each other during that first colonial century. \n\nThis is where, IMHO, knowing the medieval background (which is a very, very recent scholarly development; you will definitely find medievalists who would stipulate all the evidence in my answer and agree that the scholars I cited did solid work but not be \"comfortable\" with their conclusions) can help out the murky mess. The foundations for prejudice are well laid, but it's through slavery--the need to justify it, and the daily experience of white people getting to see themselves as systemically superior--that the earlier ideas become solidified. Unlike the Saracens of the *Cursor mundi*, these black slaves can't convert to Christianity and become white.\n\nI'm actually not sure when the Ham myth first got tied to justifying enslavement of Africans as a whole. In the 15th century, when Europe discovers the Christian (!) kingdom of Ethiopia, you can still find European scholars operating with an idea of lineage/skin color/\"race\" linked to religion, as the Ethiopians are paired with Europeans as descendants of Japheth.\n\nOne interesting point is that there was a debate whose traces pop up from time to time over whether the curse of Ham involved blackness, or was 'just' the curse of perpetual servitude. (See the Central European use to justify serfdom). \n\nBenjamin Braude, in a meandering article with some really excellent points and moments of lazy medieval history (sigh), thinks some of the crucial connection was made by initial Portuguese contact with/exploitation of West Africa, where (a) the Africans they dealt with were much darker in skin tone, on average, than the North Africans they were already involved with and (b) a good chunk of the people they encountered were Muslim. One of Braude's keenest and repeated insights, IMHO, is the importance of \"slippage\" or ambiguity and misunderstanding (deliberate? accidental? reflecting changes in surrounding thought of the time?) evident in Europeans writing about sub-Saharan Africans and slavery in the late 15-16C.\n\nBut, yeah, basically I punt to sowser. :)", "id": "czf4fqa"}, {"comment": "/u/sunagainstgold has very kindly punted this over to me, but truth be told she's already done a superb job of talking around the subject that there's not much more I can add!\n\nFrom very early meaningful encounters with dark-skinned people in Africa, there are people who articulate ideas about racial distinction from both ends of the spectrum. That is to say, there are some in the early history of the slave trade who argue it is barbaric on the grounds that all Human beings must share a common soul and be inherently equal before God (which is essentially the argument that you can see in later developments in Quaker theology that help to promote abolitionism in Quaker communities); there are others who articulate from the get-go the fundamental degradation of African character being embodied in their skin colour. In that early period though, both views are exceptional and essentially theological and moral speculation; they aren't yet defined ideologies and they aren't yet concepts people are really grappling with *en masse*.\n\nIn terms of the Curse of Ham specifically, it does appear in English racial discourse as early as the late 16th Century. A man by the name of George Best wrote a book in 1578 where he talks about the Curse of Ham and articulates it as an explanation for \"the cause of the Ethiopian blackness\". I've put an extract below that describes his thoughts on the topic. Some people struggle with 16th Century writing, so I've taken the liberty of putting together a bit of a transliteration to make it easy to read, but you can find a full copy of the original [here](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/voyages/v12/best/complete.html). Best essentially rejected the idea that the climate of Africa could possibly be the source of blackness of skin colour because in his view, it must surely be the most ideal climate on Earth and, even if the heat of the Sun was to blame, surely then the coolness of night would counter-act that. For Best, the Curse of Ham was a superior explanation for the dark skin tones of Africans.\n\n> And of this blacke and cursed Chus came all these blacke Moores which are in Africa, for after the water was vanished from off the face of the earth, and that the [land] was dry, Sem chose that part of the land to [live] in, which [now] is called Asia, and Iaphet had that which now is called Europa, wherein wee dwell, and Africa remained for Cham and his blacke sonne Africa was called Chamesis. Chus, and was called Chamesis after the fathers name, being perhaps a cursed, dry, sandy, and [not fruitful] ground, fit for such a generation to [live] in.\n\n> Thus you see, that the cause of the Ethiopians blacknesse is the curse and [natural] infection of blood, and not the [intensity] of the Climate; Which also may [be] [proved] by this example, that these blacke men are found in all parts of Africa, as well without the [tropical regions], as within, [even] [in the] Capo de buona Speranza Southward, where, by reason of the Sphere, should be the same temperature that is in Sicilia, Morea and Candie, where [all are] of very good complexions. [So] I conclude, that the blacknesse [comes not out of] the hotenesse of the Clime, but as I [said], of the infection of blood, and therefore this their argument gathered of the Africans blacknesse is not able to destroy the temperature of the middle Zone.\n\n> [It] may therefore very well [be] [ascertained], that [under] the [Equinoctial] is the most pleasant and delectable place of the worlde to dwell in; where although the [Sun] for two [hours] in a [year] be direct [over] their heades, and therefore the heate at that time somewhat of force, yet Greatest temperature [under] the Equinoctial because it [is so rare], and [continues for] so small a time, when it [comes], it is not to bee wayed, but rather the moderate heate of other times in all the [year] to be [remembered]. And if the heate at any time should in the short day [increase], the coldnesse of the long night there would easily refresh it, according as Henterus sayeth, speaking of the temperature [under] the [Equinoctial].\n\nSo as an explanation for differences in skin colour and perceived racial worth, the Curse of Ham is a very old idea in English discourse at least, one that goes all the way back to the 16th Century. But as /u/sunagainstgold alludes to, this is really something quite exceptional as a rationalisation and justification for racial difference, and it's one that you can say pre-assumes superiority on the part of white Europeans. This is, essentially, an early motivation for or rationalisation of racism at a time when the very notion of race - as we would understand it today - is in its infancy. Best is not for his party writing to justify slavery; he is simply trying to explain the wider world as he is encountering it. Other writers at the same time were much more seriously considering climatic difference as the main reason for skin differences, and his words are clearly constructed to offer a rejection of that thesis.\n\nThis kind of religious rationalisation for racial difference doesn't really start to get articulated for another century or so in a meaningful way; and even then, it's far from universally adopted by slave holding and trading interests. It's really in the 18th and 19th centuries, and especially in the religious culture of the antebellum South, where the Curse of Ham starts to *really* gain traction as a rationalisation for both racial difference and a justification of slavery. Nowhere else in the world goes to the same lengths to justify racial slavery than the antebellum South does; in the 19th Century, you find an entire genre of literature dedicated to helping slave owners reconcile their Christian faith with slave holding. This is an extract from one such book published in 1864 by a Southern preacher called *Nellie Norton*, which takes the form of an imagined discussion between a young woman and her older uncle (full text [here](https://archive.org/details/53950989.4112.emory.edu):\n\n> \"The curse pronounced by God, through Noah, upon Ham and his descendants, is subject to no such restrictions and limitations as governed enslaved Hebrews. It was to extend from generation to generation, to be perpetual. Hence you see Abraham 'the father of the faithful, the friend of God,' was the owner of a large number of slaves. Some were 'born in his house,' and some were 'bought with his money.' So it is evident that slavery was common in those days; and the domestic slave trade, so much abhorred by the abolitionists, and which affords themes of such bitter denunciations against the South, was also practised, even by the very best men. Abraham trafficked in human flesh, when he bought servants with his money.\"\n\n> \"My dear uncle, you shock me, you horrify me, when you say that Abraham, 'in whom all the families of the earth were to be blest,' bought human beings for the purpose of enslaving them. Surely this cannot be true; but, if it is, I apprehend, the reason is to be found in the fact, that in the dark age in which Abraham lived, the people were not civilized and enlightened as they are now. They saw through a glass darkly, that was but the misty twilight of our day.\"\n\n> \"But Nelly, it was so ordained of God, and He was not less wise and good then than now. The advancement of the world has not enlightened the mind, nor refined the sensibilities of deity. I think your sensibilities are morbid, when they revolt at that which God has done. Your sympathy for the slave is, I fear, quite above your reverence for Deity. Be careful, lest in avoiding Scylla you are wrecked in Charybdis.\"\n\nNow, the extent to which these kinds of ideas and discussions *explain* racial prejudice (in the sense that they made slavery possible) or instead *rationalise it* (in the sense that they are purposefully put together to justify slavery) has very much been debated. /u/sunagainstgold is right on the mark when she says that it's extremely difficult to unpick motivation from rationalisation in the evolution of ideas about race and slavery. It is certainly true that ideas like the Curse of Ham explaining darkness of skin do, to some extent, represent *ex post facto* justifications for the institution of slavery. But it is *also* true that in other ways they represent authentic motivations for its practice. The relationship between race and slavery is a complex, symbiotic one; they evolve together in a vicious cycle.\n\nFor my part, I usually frame the evolution of race in the sense that - as /u/sunagainstgold's post talks about brilliantly - you can see traces of what could *become* racial prejudice before the slave trade begins, with ideas of white purity and black degradation. These ideas, combined especially with very obvious differences in culture and religion, go some way to making initial involvement in the slave trade agreeable. In the early days though, it is very much cultural difference that matters: there was a time when an African slave in English colonies had a chance at securing freedom (or better terms of service) by becoming Christian. Slavery itself creates the cycle: slavery dehumanises and degrades its victims, which - combined with a need to justify their involvement - encourages Europeans to see Africans as degraded, which then encourages them in turn to treat Africans in an even lower regard, which encourages further degradation, etc. etc. It's a vicious, reinforcing cycle that slowly causes negative European perceptions of African culture and society to collapse together with perception of skin colour, until by the mid-17th Century you really have this notion that black people are *inherently* meant to be slaves by the colour of their skin well and truly entrenched (it essentially becomes law in North America from the 1660s, when colonial authorities make it clear slaves are slaves permanently and by maternal heredity, not because of their lack of Christian religion).", "id": "czfcs2v"}, {"comment": "To offer more detail, I've talked about this in a few answers on AskHistorians.

(Or not always - they did wear heavier clothing when it was cold.) Yes, they wore more layers and covered more of their skin than we do in the heat, but they were not wearing the equivalent of a winter jacket at all times. During the 18th century (which I'm looking at as you mentioned the Founding Fathers), men and women wore a linen undergarment at all times: the men's shirt was cut to above the knee and with long sleeves and a high collar; the women's shift was a bit longer and had a deep neckline and sleeves just below the elbow. Linen is smooth and cooling, pulling moisture from the skin and out to dissipate. On top of this, men wore a waistcoat and breeches, and women the stays (corset) and petticoats; then on top, for men the coat, and for women the gown. And that sounds like a lot, when you think about it on a hot day when the air isn't moving! But in practice, all of these could be made of fairly light and breathable materials. Linen clothing was not high-status and therefore was not frequently preserved, but we do have a few examples; we also have homespun cotton menswear, and we know that women were wearing muslin gowns from at least midcentury. (These were fitted. In the 1780s, loose, unfitted \"chemise gowns\" that were held in with a sash were a more casual and even cooler alternative.)\n\nAnother option was simply not getting dressed fully. English travelers reported that in the southern colonies during the summer, men sometimes went out and about without coat or wig (usually replacing it with a loose cap, which would satisfy the requirement of having one's head covered as well as providing protection from the sun), and women in loose jackets without stays. If at home, undress was even more acceptable: men and women could wear lightweight wrapping gowns with only the base layer underneath, or shirt and breeches/shift and petticoat. Field slaves were often assigned only the latter outfits, occasionally being assigned a summer jacket to wear on top.\n\nLinda Baumgarten's *What Clothes Reveal* was my main textual source here: it's the go-to book on specifically American dress.

Yes, they wore more layers and covered more of their skin than we do in the heat, but they were not wearing the equivalent of a winter jacket at all times. During the 18th century (which I'm looking at as you mentioned the Founding Fathers), men and women wore a linen undergarment at all times: the men's shirt was cut to above the knee and with long sleeves and a high collar; the women's shift was a bit longer and had a deep neckline and sleeves just below the elbow. Linen is smooth and cooling, pulling moisture from the skin and out to dissipate. On top of this, men wore a waistcoat and breeches, and women the stays (corset) and petticoats; then on top, for men the coat, and for women the gown. And that sounds like a lot, when you think about it on a hot day when the air isn't moving! But in practice, all of these could be made of fairly light and breathable materials. Linen clothing was not high-status and therefore was not frequently preserved, but we do have a few examples; we also have homespun cotton menswear, and we know that women were wearing muslin gowns from at least midcentury. (These were fitted. In the 1780s, loose, unfitted \"chemise gowns\" that were held in with a sash were a more casual and even cooler alternative.)\n\nAnother option was simply not getting dressed fully. English travelers reported that in the southern colonies during the summer, men sometimes went out and about without coat or wig (usually replacing it with a loose cap, which would satisfy the requirement of having one's head covered as well as providing protection from the sun), and women in loose jackets without stays. If at home, undress was even more acceptable: men and women could wear lightweight wrapping gowns with only the base layer underneath, or shirt and breeches/shift and petticoat. Field slaves were often assigned only the latter outfits, occasionally being assigned a summer jacket to wear on top.\n\nLinda Baumgarten's *What Clothes Reveal* was my main textual source here: it's the go-to book on specifically American dress.

The issue of the ivory tower of academia certainly isn't new, but it's still a huge issue to overcome. But, at least, it's an issue that we know about and that we try to address from time to time. I don't think we'll ever gain the status of brain trust or that we'll ever become the old, wise sages that society turns to for guidance - that's just not realistic. \n\nHowever, historians do already influence society right now in various ways. Various governments and organisations ask historians to look into certain subjects in a search for closure and clarity - here in Belgium, we have had Senate-backed commissions into the murder of Patrice Lumumba, Julien Lahaut, and so on. History is still an important factor in politics regarding certain subjects - just look at the history wars regarding Israel and Palestine, or look at how the history of things like slavery/Jim Crow or the treatment of Native Americans still influence the public debate in America. \n\nThen there are less political areas - entertainment, for instance. Historians regularly work as advisers for TV shows, movies, books and so on and often join the debates surrounding them - look at Hamilton in the US, for instance. We also can't ignore the fact that a lot of people are simply interested in history in itself - reading books or articles about various historical subjects. And while we're often somewhat dismissive of pophistory, it's a good window to the general public that deserves more attention. \n\nThen there are the less obvious areas. For instance, having a history is important for everyone - a lot of people take this for granted, but knowing where you come from - even if that story were to be a fiction - is important in forming your own identity. And while a lot of people can get that through osmosis, for minorities, for instance, this is an active process that historians are involved in. The revisiting of history in search for the stories and the groups that have been forgotten in the mainstream drafts is incredibly important for a lot of people. In America, reframing the old narrative of African Americans as purely being passive victims, downtrodden and without agency - ultimately being side-characters in a play about white Americans - doesn't only return agency to those African Americans in the past, but also gives it to those in the present. And while efforts in this direction may not get the attention it deserves from the masses, it does get attention from people who invariably gain a lot from this revisiting. \n\nAnd maybe a bit more esoteric, we can't forget about historians themselves. There are plenty of history grads entering society every year and they've all ultimately been shaped by the study of history and will in turn help shape others. \n\nThose are just a few ways in which historians already have an influence on society and I didn't even bother to mention museums yet. But ultimately, we can do better. And we're trying to. Fields such as public history make it their goal to bring history as close as they can to the people. Various efforts in general have been made to accomplish this - picking neglected subjects, working with laypersons, encouraging fields like oral history, moving away from the academic writing style, and so on. Generally, there are many historians trying to be more open, trying to be more inclusive, trying to be more interesting in an effort to bring history to the public. \n\nThe ivory tower still exists, yes, but we're working on it. It's unlikely that it'll ever be gone - and it has certain advantages - but I wouldn't despair about the place of history in society. It's there and it'll still be there for centuries to come.

You listed Historian's being influential in matters like Israel/Palestine, but what have they actually achieved? I hate to be a cynic and I don't claim to know much about it, but it just seems like in the past few decades history has been repeating itself. For example, the long drawn out conflicts in Iran and Iraq have become remnants of recent history now that we seem to have moved on to Syria.\n\nAnother point you made was history being inextricably linked to identity, which I agree with. However, witnessing the US election has led me to wonder how many US citizens are fully aware of their history? They are so bound to their constitution and the history surrounding their founding fathers, yet their interest seems to have stagnated there. Being unable to see the blatant plagiarism of Presidents as recent as Nixon and Reagan is something I can't wrap my head around. My area of study is American History, by the way, I don't mean to repeat myself so much about the election but it's blowing my mind.\n\nWhat do you think Historians could do better to engage with the public? I appreciate that they advise on popular tv shows, films and stage shows and I know this will grab the attention of any history enthusiasts to research further. However, in my classes and seminars there's certainly an air of pessimism at the idea most of us will not use our degree for a career in history. This isn't due to the lack of jobs - we've had many talks about the broad range of history-centred jobs we could pursue. More than anything, I think we all had grandiose ideas that we would become well-known academics in high reaching positions. The fact Historians are overlooked in the makings of big budget films and tv shows is dawning on us.

That said, in recent years, particularly now in the \"digital era\", there's been a growing dialog about the philosophy of history (\"What is the purpose of studying history?\"), historiography (\"How do we study history?\"), museology (\"What is the purpose and mission of institutions for these disciplines?\"), pedagogy (\"How do we learn and teach?\"), and other disciplines.\n\nI'm more aligned towards the study of museology specifically but my studies there have informed at least some opinion on the topic, where I'd say this-\n\nI think that the key defining trait of a *historian* is a desire to seek out primary sources and report, with some sense of objectivity, what actually occurred using as little conjecture as possible. Inasmuch, I'd argue that the chief questions of the historian are what, when, and where; questions like \"why\" and \"how\" are relevant but tend towards conjecture. If a contemporaneous source writes in a journal why he did something, a historian reporting on that is a question of \"What\" (\"What was said?\") and not actually seeking to answer the question of \"Why\". \n\n\"Why\" and \"how\" trend towards anthropology and sociology. They can overlap into history but are also disciplines worth defining in their own rights. Many historians will incorporate anthropological sources and methods into their work, and naturally, anthropologists will consult the work of historians, or even undertake historical research themselves. \n\nI don't know Carlin's work that well, so I won't comment, but as for Diamond, I'd argue that he's an anthropologist who uses history to inform his work, but he's not precisely a historian. I'd argue that (most) high school history teachers aren't historians either- they're teachers, history is a topic that they are knowledgeable about, but they're not necessarily researchers. History teachers study the work of historians; historians study history. \n\nAll this said, I'm not really interested in gatekeeping the title of \"historian\" and I don't think that being a historian is a superior position to being an anthropologist or teacher. All these positions serve different roles, for different purposes. A teacher may inspire someone to become a historian; that historian may influence an anthropologist; the anthropologist may inspire more people to become historians; those historians may inspire more people to become history teachers; and on and on and on.\n\nTo emphasize the non-superiority (that is to say, equality) of disciplines, I would end on the note that the very question you ask isn't really something that can be answered by historians (who would report on the history of the idea, role, definition of \"historian\") and instead is a philosophical question."], [3, "Hi, you may find some previous responses interesting\n\n* [What does a Historian actually do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/36irre/what_does_a_historian_actually_do/)\n\n* [What does a historian do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/17uwaf/what_does_a_historian_do/)\n\n* [What do historians actually do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1z06vs/what_do_historians_actually_do/)\n\n* [What Makes a \"Good\" Historian?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/58c6t8/what_makes_a_good_historian/)"], [0, "For me anyone can claim to be a historian.

And considering that to the end-user a good history book based on secondary sources and a good history book based on primary sources look more or less the same, unless one trawls through the footnotes, I get that confusion. I get that it sounds unfair that one of these people gets called a historian, and one does not, even though they produce works of similar quality. After all, even academic historians call both of these works \"history books.\" \n\nWhat do we call the person who writes good history books based on secondary sources only?\n\nThe answer should probably be \"history writer\" or something. In other fields, this would be obvious: nobody blinks an eye when Richard Dawkins' popular science books aren't considered to be on the same level as Bill Bryson's. (Okay, not an entirely fair comparison, but you get my point.) Nobody thinks that writing a book on chemistry makes you a chemist, and most would say that you probably need to be a chemist in the first place if you want to write a book on the subject with any depth. But language means what people think it means, not what's abstractly logical, and people don't think about history in quite that way, for better or worse.\n\nOn the other hand, it's not as clear cut as that in history. It's much easier for people who are not historians to actually contribute to the field than it is in just about any other academic field. To name an example I'm familiar with: Edward Luttwak is not considered to be a historian, but nobody would deny that he's had immense influence on the debate about Roman grand strategy, even if he's also inspired a lot of pushback. It's hard to imagine a non-chemist having such influence on chemistry.\n\n(u/commiespaceinvader mentions that there are people on this sub as examples of historians who through their work here earn that title without the benefits of formal training, but 95% or more of what gets posted here does not consist of original research, and under this definition would not make the writers historians.

In a certain sense, while some would argue that there is little that separates a craft like history from a art like literature (hello, Haydn White), being a historian as a profession is \u2013 like being a sociologist or a political scientist, a biologist, a physicist or even a mechanic or a plumber \u2013 a profession. A profession for which people train, in most cases in a formal setting that require you to show a knowledge of the field and how to apply methods to the material.\n\nI am someone who strongly believes that someone who even if they do not posses the formal qualifications like a PhD can earn the title of historian by, as /u/pipkin42 wrote, contribute new knowledge to the historical field. I mean, just look at the many awesome contributors we have here who are not formally trained historians but contribute so so much to the study of history and public dissemination of said study by posting here. A contribution to the field that is so much more awesome in the literal sense when thinking about how many of these contributors spend literally hundreds of hours acquainting themselves with source material and methods without having the benefit of formal training.\n\nWhat sets them apart from people like Dan Carlin or Jared Diamond, both of whom never claimed to be historians in the first place, is that their historical work is sound, as in it follows the high standards set by the profession, they make an effort to take source material seriously, and they make an informed, as in based on evidence, effort to convey historical narratives.\n\nNothing in /u/pipkin42 's post contradicts calling these contributors historians, the same way nobody would take issue in calling someone who has spent hundreds or thousands of hours invested in the study of biology or physics and who contributed new findings to the field  even without formal training  a physicist or biologist.\n\nAnd yet, the fact that you aggressively imply that anybody here would deny them being called historians, leads me to the strong suspicion that you either do not understand what historians do or do not take it seriously the way you'd take someone who is a physicist or a biologist or a mechanic seriously.\n\nIt's not a conniving attempt to discredit people. It's the idea that people adhere to certain standards in order to be considered part of a profession.

Whether they take sources and methods seriously in the pursuit of historical knowledge or if they don't. Jared Diamond doesn't and doesn't claim to be a historian. Dan Carlin doesn't and doesn't claim to be a historian. History teachers are in a good position to do so but not all do (which doesn't diminish what they otherwise do).

I develop a theoretically informed method for testing this hypothesis (let's say, I will use literary approaches to analyze tropes within fifth-century texts to show that their descriptions of barbarians are all just re-hashed literary tropes, not real descriptions of events). I test this null hypothesis by reading the texts through this lens. I find that, despite this effort, many details remain which cannot be explained as literary tropes through my analysis. Barbarians do appear to be a factor in the texts in a real, not just literary, way. The null hypothesis is rejected, and I am left with the evidence which suggests that barbarians could, indeed, have played an important role in the empire's breakup. This is Bryan Ward-Perkins' argument in a nutshell.\n\nWe don't usually break down what we do in these terms, because we're not habituated to thinking of our work the way social scientists do. But, I'll maintain that all good historians produce work along these lines. Of course, our process is not so neatly linear. We spend a lot of time reading our sources before we formulate hypotheses or settle on methods to prove them, and we repeat this recursive process as our project continues, so that it all ends up being much more ad hoc than a well structured experiment (although: much science is done this way, too). When we publish, we often sweep this process under a rug and present our work as a finished narrative (as do many scientists), which makes it difficult for others to reproduce our work. But, of course, they could if they repeated our analysis -- as reviewers can do with occasionally damning explanations of their failure to reproduce the analyses of some shoddy historical scholarship (ie, critiques of the analysis used in the text under review).\n\nAlthough we use different language from the social sciences, at the end of the day we're working with claims (hypotheses), theories, methods for testing our claims, and results. Recognizing this is, I think, important for our discpline, because we need to combat the popular misconception that historians' work is less rigorous or methodological than the research scientists do. Many members of the public -- and many of my students -- think history is something that comes from unstructured thinking about books, and that makes our graduate degrees look much softer than they actually are, like anybody off the streets who sat around reading books for seven years could do history. We must explain how method matters, that we do test hypotheses -- just not while wearing lab coats or using million dollar machines.", "id": "dafwu4q"}, {"comment": "This whole discussion seems to presuppose that science is something more well defined than it really is. \n\nFirst of all, there is the problem of what we mean by science at all. After all, there are a number of senses of 'science'. Classically this refers to something like the newtonian ideal of science, indeed this is where the notion of 'social sciences' came from, namely, these were the fields that were meant to produce universal (that is newtonian) laws of human behaviour. But, while this notion of a singular idea of 'science' has generally, and for good reason, fallen out of favour in the technical discourse on the issue, it remains highly popular more generally (eg. it seems to lie behind many of the comments \nin this thread). \n\nSecondly, even if we suppose that there is some clearly defined thing that is science, there isn't, in reality, a method that is properly characteristic of science, at least in an exclusive sense. I mean there is the 'scientific method' that we all learned in school, which you note in this comment, but this doesn't really govern the way actual science is done, and insofar as we can find examples of scientific discoveries made using this method, we can equally find prominent examples that don't. There has been decades of discussion about how to formulate a defining characteristic of science in philosophy of science (ie. the demarcation problem) so as to distinguish science from pseudo-science in particular and other disciplines generally. But there still isn't any clear agreement on this issue.\n\nThirdly, as a result of these issues -- the first in particular -- there has been a more general trend towards viewing the sciences as a collection of related fields, but in general the field has seen stronger voices promoting the proper plurality of science, that is to say that on both a methodological and ontological level the different sciences are at least potentially different. So a biological method is not just a description of chemistry at a higher level, but biological laws are fundamental in themselves for describing biological phenomena.\n\nFinally, and drawing this discussion back to history somewhat, we should be careful with our use of the language of experimentation, as we can go about describing many processes in terms of experimentation that have little relationship to science. For example, we can have a theory about the literary role of Hamlet, pose a hypothesis and search through the book for evidence. (We can trivially produce a variety of other descriptions of work in clearly non-scientific fields in terms of a textbook 'scientific method'.) That we can describe a behaviour in terms of some methodology that we take to be scientific (as it is not clear that science is characterised by a method) does not mean that that behaviour is scientific. This is a broader problem, insofar as the ways in which philosophers of science have tried to describe scientific activity are often applicable to most academic fields. Take for example Kuhn's notion of regular science, wherein most scientists aren't engaged in revolutionary science, attempting to overturn big theories, but are rather attempting to muddle along solving regular old small problems given the parameters of the theory into which they fall. But this is, of course, at least potentially a perfectly good description of almost any well functioning academic field (that most people accept the theoretical presuppositions of the environment and expand the field by working on the pre-existing problems that that framework provides). Indeed, though I'm not sure I could find it again, I watch a while back a debate on the direction that philosophy should move in and it fell out in essentially these terms, with one person arguing that good work can be done in terms of solving small, incremental problems in terms of the given parameters, with the other arguing that philosophers should generally give up the small problems and be working more on bigger issues of paradigm. \n\nSo where does this leave us with history? There is indeed a lot of cultural capital in the idea of science at the moment, although I'm not sure that history being portrayed as a science will get it to be taken any more seriously. People are more than willing to only give science itself credence as far as it doesn't get in the way of other practical or ideological issues, cf. anti-vaxers, creationists, global warming critics, etc. Of course history has its own examples too. That said, though I don't agree with the people who want to take a stronger line on this history as science argument, I don't think it is a social science for a number of particular reasons, I think we need (and indeed are seeing to some extent) to move away from the anti-empiricists turn in history of the 1970s to some extent, and the need to properly ground a methodology of historical rigour is a clear point here. \n\nBut all this to say, history is certainly more science like than most other humanities, but we shouldn't stumble into popular misrepresentations of science while we're at it.", "id": "dag7bw3"}, {"comment": "While I don't know about the details of the example of your debate, I'm pretty sure there *is* testing, you just might not regard it as testing.\n\nFor example, if someone posit the hypothesis that \"Rome rose to a prominent position because its culture is much more aggressive than the culture of its neighbours\", he would need to actually demonstrate that Roman culture *was* more aggressive than other contemporary European cultures, while any demonstration of contemporary neighbouring cultures that were as aggressive as Roman culture, or more, would be evidence against the theory.

The most they can really control is which way they point the telescope, what kind of new detector they build, and so forth. When they wanted to test whether black hole collisions could cause gravity waves, they couldn't make their own black holes: instead, they hypothesized that gravity waves should already be out there, and their way of testing this hypothesis was to go out and look for them. Of course the evidence they needed to support or refute their claim was located in the gravitational field, and so they built a detector. The evidence historians need is more likely to be located inside some source documents or archaeological finds, and so they look for it by going to the library and whatnot.

And one way they've tested this is to review large quantities of telescope images to see if we ever see the same galaxy in two different places. I don't know offhand where they got the images for the initial experiments on this subject, but I imagine it was largely old public data that was collected for other purposes and had never been analyzed with this question in mind. \n\nAnd there's very little wrong with that, if done right. Telescope time is expensive and valuable, and this sort of study would probably require a lot of it. The potential problems would be:\n\n* If the same images *have* been used before as evidence for (or against) the same hypothesis before, obviously they shouldn't try to pass this off as independent confirmation.\n\n* If the researchers looked at the data and *then* decided whether or not to complete and publish the study, depending whether the result fits their preconceived notions, that would be naughty, (although the results could potentially still be interesting enough to publish despite this methodological flaw?)

For one thing, there's the \"publish or perish\" culture: most wouldn't have time and resources to perform big analyses like this and then selectively hold the results back.

I'd argue that (most) high school history teachers aren't historians either- they're teachers, history is a topic that they are knowledgeable about, but they're not necessarily researchers. History teachers study the work of historians; historians study history. \n\nAll this said, I'm not really interested in gatekeeping the title of \"historian\" and I don't think that being a historian is a superior position to being an anthropologist or teacher. All these positions serve different roles, for different purposes. A teacher may inspire someone to become a historian; that historian may influence an anthropologist; the anthropologist may inspire more people to become historians; those historians may inspire more people to become history teachers; and on and on and on.\n\nTo emphasize the non-superiority (that is to say, equality) of disciplines, I would end on the note that the very question you ask isn't really something that can be answered by historians (who would report on the history of the idea, role, definition of \"historian\") and instead is a philosophical question.", "id": "dafcjn7"}], [{"comment": "Hi, you may find some previous responses interesting\n\n* [What does a Historian actually do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/36irre/what_does_a_historian_actually_do/)\n\n* [What does a historian do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/17uwaf/what_does_a_historian_do/)\n\n* [What do historians actually do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1z06vs/what_do_historians_actually_do/)\n\n* [What Makes a \"Good\" Historian?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/58c6t8/what_makes_a_good_historian/)", "id": "dafes7g"}], [{"comment": "For me anyone can claim to be a historian.

Moreover, by this point the British and North American dialects had been more or less separate for hundreds of years.\n\nSo no, the Canadian dialect seeming less 'British' to your ears is not a matter of American influence. It is simply because the dialects of the US and Canada\u2014there are many, see /u/AOEUD's comments in this thread\u2014have been developing 'independently' from the UK for a lot longer than the dialects of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Furthermore, there are many dialects of English throughout the UK and no single 'British accent'. British dialects have continued to change in the hundreds of years since the era of colonization. Keep in mind that the dialects of the various English-speaking communities throughout ~~the British Isles~~ Great Britain have been diverging since way back when they were speaking Old English.\n\nLanguages gradually change over time. When language communities are separated by large geographic barriers (e.g. the Atlantic Ocean), their dialects will continue to change but *in different ways*.

We usually consider the different forms of English to be forms of a single language, because we can all still understand each other: English dialects are mutually intelligible (at least for now).

I've added corrections in my answer above where necessary.\n\nAs far as accents go, well I don't disagree with you. In your example, we are considering how a native speaker of a particular dialect (Yorkshire English) speaks another dialect (Standard English). Whether we are comparing between dialects or languages, we are still using \"accent\" to refer to the overall concept of how someone's usual forms of speaking impact their speech patterns when using other forms of speaking.\n\nIf the original post was asking about how, for example, a native English speaker from Australia may still have a noticeable difference in their speech when speaking American Standard English with native English speakers in the US.... Well that would be a question about accents. This is not how I interpreted the question though.\n\nIf however the original post was asking why the speech of native English speakers in Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa seem to share similarities that the speech of native English speakers in the US and Canada do not... Well that would be a question about dialects. This is how I interpreted the question.\n\nOverall though, I do agree with you. Accents aren't only about people speaking their non-native languages, it is also about how people speak other dialects as well. It is a semantic distinction that I unfortunately glossed over in my answer.\n\nNot everyone agrees on the meaning of \"accent\", and in some contexts it can be a politically charged controversy. I wonder whether or not you consider the following cases to be examples of accents:\n\n* The way a native African-American Vernacular English speaker uses American Standard English\n* The way someone with a speech impediment uses UK Standard English\n* The way a native English speaker from the US uses American Sign Language (ASL)\n* The way a Yorkshireman uses British Sign Language (BSL)\n* The way that a native ASL signer uses BSL\n\nHopefully from these examples, we can appreciate how what counts as an \"accent\" depends on several politically charged distinctions. What counts as a dialect, especially when the community in question (e.g. AAVE speakers) are stigmatized? What counts as an accent, when the manner of speaking is influenced by a disability affecting speech production? What counts as an accent, when we consider not just spoken-aural languages but also gestural-visual languages?", "id": "cyzux2j"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cyy4pxi"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cyy9qkr"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cyyb4aq"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cyycjbt"}, {"comment": "Fantastic!

Republicanism as a form of government had already become entrenched as a legitimate and functional state and there was simply no advantage for Hitler to formally crown himself as a huge thrust of the NDSAP's logic was that Hitler was merely carrying out the will of the people by eliminating democratic roadblocks to reform. Furthermore, the German upper class simply had no taste for Hitler himself. He had no legitimacy, came from a distinctly lower-class background and his behaviors were at best middle-class leading the international press to ridicule his pretensions to power as early as 1934. Hitler personally had an equal dislike for the German aristocracy, which he would have probably completely displaced with a semi-Aryan system of nobility based on wartime service had he actually won the war.\n\nAgain, much of this is simply an extrapolation of the man's policies and the stated policies of his subordinates such as Heinrich Himmler.\n\n>I mean didn't Hitler role as Leader include some symbolic parts akin to a kingship?\n\nI think that would be a very serious stretch to make for a variety of reasons that are far outside the scope of your initial question. Hitler certainly enjoyed a level of theatrical ceremony, but none of it could really be called strictly monarchical in nature.\n\n>Didn't they also form a state religion, it seems like there is a lot of precedent for a monarch as head of state religion they would have liked.\n\nThe religious beliefs of senior Nazi Party members continues to be a source of serious debate even today. Hitler did create the Protestant Reich Church in order to unify the various Protestant Churches that had haphazardly formed in Germany since the Reformation but this was immensely unpopular. I've read some sources that state that the Protestant Reich Church removed the Bible from the pulpit but I find that to be, frankly, completely unlikely. Perhaps someone with better knowledge can comment but there are several sources that list normal, pre-war church services that were conducted with complete regularity throughout the war.\n\nSo, no, the Nazis didn't create a state religion. They formed a unified church body that some Nazis had some weird fantasy designs upon, but ultimately came to nothing from what I've personally read.\n\n>I guess what I'm asking for is the Nazis/Hitler's view on monarchy and whether there was any discussion about making him King.\n\nThere were none.

He also has written two works on which Ken Livingstone recurs: *Zionism in the age of dictators* and *51 Documents: Zionist Collaboration with the Nazis*. These books are the perfect examples why in the historical profession (and also in this sub) context is so important. Especially in the second book, Brenner presents 51 documents without putting them in proper historical context. Rather he measures them against his political moral compass, which is obviously influenced by what we know now about how Nazism progresses and ends up. Brenner's books are not historical examinations but rather political pamphlets, intended to show that in accordance with the view of Nazism as the ultimate manifestation of capitalist imperialism, Zionism viewed by him as another form of imperialism had to be allied. In essence, he does the same thing people who compare the Palestinians to Nazis do, just from the other side.

Brenner in his work on the subject tends to ignore the long history of socialist/communist strands of Zionist politics and rather focuses heavily on Revisionist Zionists such as the Lehi (Stern Gang), a Zionist paramilitary organization in Mandate Palestine that fought the British with violent means throughout WWII. He also has written two works on which Ken Livingstone recurs: *Zionism in the age of dictators* and *51 Documents: Zionist Collaboration with the Nazis*. These books are the perfect examples why in the historical profession (and also in this sub) context is so important. Especially in the second book, Brenner presents 51 documents without putting them in proper historical context. Rather he measures them against his political moral compass, which is obviously influenced by what we know now about how Nazism progresses and ends up. Brenner's books are not historical examinations but rather political pamphlets, intended to show that in accordance with the view of Nazism as the ultimate manifestation of capitalist imperialism, Zionism viewed by him as another form of imperialism had to be allied. In essence, he does the same thing people who compare the Palestinians to Nazis do, just from the other side.

It was at this point that they also ramped up domestic anti-Jewish policies (under the guise of rootless cosmopolitanism), because they now saw Jewish sympathy for the state of Israel as a threat rather than a harmless expression of nationalism and communist enthusiasm. \nThere was also a wider Soviet government fear of international connections and relationships between people living in the USSR and people outside the country, as there was legitimately a lot of population movement within Eastern Europe during WWII. And since Jews often did have family or friends living somewhere outside the USSR (thanks to the Jewish diaspora), and the period directly after the end of the Holocaust was a time when Jews living outside Eastern Europe were most eager to get in touch with family and friends to find out the fate of those Jews who had been under Nazi occupation, there really was a boom in international communication. This terrified the Soviet state, who saw it as potentially politically threatening (they never liked any soviet citizens communicating with people outside the USSR), and so contribute to the accusation that Jews were rootless cosmopolitans. To be clear, that remained a false and antisemitic charge- after the Soviet success against the Nazis, nearly all Soviet Jews had become huge fans of Stalin and supporters of the Soviet government.", "id": "d6ps7f8"}, {"comment": "Thanks!", "id": "d6q7cim"}, {"comment": "I'm not sure of the details, but the USSR cast a key vote for the creation of Israel in '48.", "id": "d6pbh4v"}, {"comment": "This is fascinating.", "id": "d6pbgfx"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d6o50cd"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d6o6u8l"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d6o5b8f"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d6o5kqk"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d6o8sn8"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d6o8hvz"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d6o9vze"}], [{"comment": "Well for the left I think we have to consider the possibility of political influences and opportunism.

As others have pointed out, there are some problems with the Trans-Atlantic slave trade parallels, but let me take a different tact with this question and look at the early modern period's interaction between Barbary Coast corsairs and American and European prisoners, specifically with the story of James Leander Cathcart.\n\nMr. Cathcart had participated in the Revolutionary War as a Privateer (tender age of 15 or so) and post-War became a ship captain transporting lumber and other agricultural products to markets in the Mediterranean when his ship was captured by the Barbary Coast Corsairs operating out of Algeria.\n\nCathcart and his crew were held for ransom, but as low-profile prisoners, their release wasn't happening anytime soon. During captivity, Cathcart was 'selected' to be the personal zoo keeper of the local Dey who, Cathcart reports, ordered that he receive received regular beatings (bastinado) to the point where he permanently lost some of his toenails. However, his treatment, by and large, wasn't nearly that bad consistently; he used that position to learn a smattering of Turkish and Arabic and eventually became a secretary for the very prisons in which his crew were being held. \n\nSo far, Cathcart's story seems to be analogous to black slaves in America, but this quickly changes and the analogy falls apart:\n\nHe used his position and privilege to pay for better (and more) food for his crewmates as well as purchased a house, hired servants, and even owned a tavern or two. He becomes a highly-trusted and valued translator and advisor to the Dey. Eventually, the United States signed the Treaty of Algiers with the Barbary Coast powers and Cathcart was released as part of the deal. He sold all his Algerian possessions and rounded up his crew, sailing back to America. Cathcart would eventually return to the Barbary Coast as a diplomat, but this is outside the scope of your question.\n\nMore to the point of your question; yes, white Europeans/Americans *were* taken as prisoners (I would hesitate to say \"slaves\") and treated poorly, but there is really no equivalent to the way that Africans were treated in the Americas. You'll note that Cathcart's treatment was unusual even within the context of his own tale; while he was working, his crewmates languished in a kind of prison awaiting ransom. Indeed, most crews were ransomed in this period and, until the end of the Second Barbary Coast War, this was a common practice; the prisoners were more valuable as ransom than as slaves. More difficult to discern from Cathcart's anecdotal stories is the way in which slaves were treated; physical punishment - even severe beatings - were common in a lot of societies (just try being an offender on one of His Majesty's naval ships) and Cathcart makes these beatings seem random and arbitrary (which they *could* be, but most likely aren't). Also, Cathcart very quickly comes to secure his own property, had servants of his own, and operated businesses; I cannot think of a single slave in the Americas who has a similar experience *before* emancipation. All in all, Cathcart's experience is a-typical at best and possibly unique.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about Cathcart, I recommend his book \"[The Captives: Eleven Years a Prisoner in Algiers] (https://archive.org/details/captives00cathrich)\" which was compiled and printed by Cathcart's daughter well after the ordeal. \n\nA more interesting question, and examination, of poor treatment of \"White\" slaves would be when Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland and sent tens of thousands of Irish Catholics into slavery in [Barbados and the Caribbean] (https://youtu.be/PSlOSXZ9TCI?t=531). Irish, for most of modern British history, were barely considered human and so might come closest to poor treatment and slavery that parallels the Black experience in the Americas (but even *that* falls apart as the Irish integrate, change religion, and move to the provinces).

I am unsure the absence of something could be considered as anything other than pure speculations, however, are there any sources or analyses for how the slave trade affected the socio-political stability of Africa?\n\nIt seems to me that the current state of abject poverty and instability in Africa has its roots in it being stripped of its human resources for four hundred years. The thirty million people stolen, sold or killed (if I'm adding correctly from the [wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Human_toll)'s reference of Patrick Manning's estimates) had to have affected the societies from which they came. The Wikipedia article make some references to this, but I'm not certain its represented well.\n\nThere was some reference as to the slave trade actually *benefitted* the economies of certain African kingdoms who allowed their own people to be sold into markets -- as if short-term profit outweighed the long-term costs of human resources, the affects of social betrayal, and the damage done to the political status quos as Kings and rulers used the slavers to extinguish political rivals and enemies.\n\nAnyway, there's another argument that Europe's only real advantage over Africa was in shipbuilding at the start of the slave trade, but by the end of it Europe was well within Industrialization while Africa remained in the Iron Age. But, it was immediately refuted in the next sentence. So, I'm looking for, perhaps, a little more clarification as to which direction the historical community as a whole sees the affects of the slave trade in Africa (it seems disingenuous at best, and blindly racist at worst, to suggest the trade had a net of zero negatives and possibly had positives in Africa). And direction as to where to go if I wanted to look more into the complexities and nuance of the more respected arguments.\n\nEdited to add: I am aware that colonialization had a major affect on African political stability as we see it today.

I don't mean in terms of the mathematical loss of people and devastation of the economy, but in terms of the individual and group rational decisions of powerful Europeans and Africans by which the people of one continent ended up as chattel slavery across the Atlantic. The spiraling situation is tragic.\n\nIn let's say 1450, western Europe and western Africa are both regions of nations rather constantly at war with each other, both comfortable with the idea of slavery and acquiring slaves via prisoners of war (although there are profound differences in the two institutions), both with nations seeking any advantage.\n\nEuropeans show up on the western African coast. They make alliances with the powerful kingdoms like Kongo, which nurtures a branch of the Portuguese descendants of the Knights Templar. The parties trade luxury goods--chandeliers and ornate mirrors adorn courts on both sides of the Sahara.\n\nAnd above all, the Europeans have guns.\n\nRemember, the nations of West Africa are always in and out of war with each other, fighting over people and land. Guns, ammo, and horses give them a *massive* boost over their enemies. Their raids are even more successful--they have more captives--sure, let's sell them to the Europeans, why not?\n\nThe Africans were judicious in choosing who to sell, too. As my favorite professor of all time puts it, \"They sold outsiders to increase their insiders\"--keeping what they saw as the best potential slaves or even new people to the nation (Joseph Miller describes Angolan slavery as 'taken-out, taken-in' reflecting the different status and meaning slaves had in west/central African societies) for themselves and selling the rest.\n\nAt least initially.

The British, for example, viewed abolition at home as an excuse \u2013 or rather a justification \u2013 for anti-slavery intervention in the Gold Coast region. Studies of British efforts and reports in this region reveal that the British, at least early on, believed that intervention, evangelical activity, and protection of freed populations to be their enlightened prerogative. Such activities, genuinely 'compassionate' or not, were an economic and political foothold for Britain in the Gold Coast, and formed the basis of British interests in the region up to the 1880s.\n\nMy own research deals quite a bit with this, specifically in the context of education. State-funded education efforts in West Africa were sparse during the 19th century, but the investments were believed to be a part of this process of rehabilitating recently-freed ('repatriated' in British terms) slaves. Even though education funding was a net loss for the British at this time, the state deemed it a worthwhile investment within the context of protecting British economic interests and, professedly, servicing the debt incurred during the heyday of trans-Atlantic slavery. This mentality reflects the general attitude of the British up to the scramble.\n\nThe other side of this issue, one that is gaining more traction within the historiography of West Africa, is the economic benefits of slavery for the slaving empires of W and SW Africa. Osei Bonsu of the Asante, for example, opposed British abolition of slavery due to the ramifications of its sudden end for the Asante economy (Source [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=IUOr00XDLbAC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=british+letter+abolition+osei+bonsu&source=bl&ots=tLKSWDSv5K&sig=gAfVuHYLN--wKfV24EWi6TCjni4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig5J6wueHKAhWIcD4KHbMQCigQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&q=osei&f=false), p.85, for the curious). This fear was very real, and the sudden collapse of the slave economy devastated the economic monocultures of these states. (One could make a cursory comparison to the economic fates of oil-dependent economies in the face of a sudden cessation of fossil fuel use, but I digress.)\n\nThis process is referred to by its British phrase (at the time) 'the shift to legitimate commerce,' and is the term through which you will generally find information on the subject. In short, this shift opened up a major hole in the West African economy at the same time that the British decided to 'step in' and build fledgling abolitionist 'protectorates' in the area, a one-two punch that put the West African economy on a trajectory of over-reliance on exports to Europe/Americas to the detriment of stable, domestic growth.\n\nSources: \n\n* From Slave Trade to 'Legitimate' Commerce: the Commercial Transition in Nineteenth-Century West Africa, Robin Law (Cambridge Press, 2002)\n* Economics and Empire, 1830-1914, D.K.

The loss of extraneous noble families -- those of whom are a threat and a figurehead for the people to rally around in a time of conflict. The degeneration of decency -- where you're more likely to give up your neighbor than to face certain death yourself. The psychic toll of demoralization and grief -- from the loss of loved ones. In addition to the lack of manpower, soldiers and supply support because your population can no longer support such a campaign, or are too demoralized to care. It all spirals down to a society who may not have the resources to turn the tide of European colonialism, or resist it for very long, or to recover from it after it's all over because at *this* point, the people have had no stable, benevolent government for over seven hundred years. \n\nI mean, in my head, it's paralleled with the subjugation of the American First Peoples: Europeans came in an set warring tribes against one another while regularly slaughtering the natives themselves. The main difference is the European colonists of America grew to consider the land theirs *during* this process, while colonization of Africa happened after the diaspora. Also (I'm not sure, so please correct me if I'm wrong), European colonization of Africa wasn't generally intended to include mass migration (South Africa being an obvious exception), it was a political maneuver to ensure the resources of that African country was for their use alone. Americans migrated, settled, expanded and continued this process until the entire continent was overrun. But Americans never attempted to install puppet governments, or allowed any of the First People Nations a home in which to live as long as they could exploit it: they kicked them out of the treaty lands and the reservations as soon as it became convienent (often several times in a single generation), and killed them if they resisted. \n\nI don't know if that parallels the African narrative of colonialization. And this entire post is less fact-history, and more speculation/reasoning behind my question. But, it seems *obvious* that, if independent from one another, four hundred years of a slave trade that strips a people of their lives, liberty, culture and security would be far more devastating than (at most) two hundred years of political proxy, puppet governments, Machevellian economics and all around asshattery would.

We actually had a hugely popular thread on this very question just last month, which I'm encourage you to take a look at [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40h2rr/was_owning_slaves_in_the_us_limited_solely_to/) for a detailed answer (I tried to get around to most follow-ups and to every follow-up I got a message about too, so look down thread too!).\n\nHistorians almost universally reject the idea that white indentured servitudes could be considered slaves. The system has a very different theoretical construction, and a different social reality, to slavery. Indentured servants were theoretically free people who entered into a voluntary contract of service in exchange for compensation at the end of that term of service. They had all manner of legal rights to protect them from abuses, they were legally seen as workers for an employer and not as property, their condition was always intended to be temporary and not determined at the whim of their master, and they were not excluded from society in the same way that slaves were. An indentured servant could own and inherit property, represent him or herself in a court of law, was considered to be working in exchange for a (delayed) payment rather than for free and so on. They had an identity outside of their master; a legal and cultural personage that could not be fully denied. A slave, in contrast, is reduced to property not only legally but socially - a slave has no existence outside of his or her owner.\n\nEven the restrictions indentured servants face reflect a qualitatively different system. They could not, for example, marry as a condition of employment; if they had a child, the woman could be whipped and the man could be made liable for contributing to the child's upkeep at a local church. But as horrid as those things are, implicit in them is a recognition of certain rights: that you *can* get married one day, that your children *are your responsibility*. Slavery did not provide that recognition; a slave literally could *not* marry, if they did so there was no recognition of it whatsoever, and their children were seen - by the white elite - as slaves who were the property of their master. Whilst children could be indentured, this was not through heredity; they were usually indentured as an alternative to living their lives in an orphanage, and many indentured children benefited from contracts that required their education or training in a profession.\n\nNow certainly, abuse in the indenture system was absolutely rife. A great many servants suffered enormously and many died under the burden of abuse and an intense workload. We see some of the abusive practices that came to characterise slavery in indentured servitude - even then, though, there are differences. Take sexual exploitation; sexual abuse was common for female servants and slaves alike but unlike black slaves, whose bodies were literally reduced to objects for their owner's exploitation (whether for forced labour or sexual gratification), an indentured woman at least *notionally* had a *right* to seek prosecution for sexual abuse. *Proving* it was extremely difficult, but it was extremely difficult for *any* white woman - even a wealthy woman - in this period to prove that she had been made to have sex without her consent by a man of station. Contrast that with a slave woman where it wouldn't matter even if she could live up to the obscenely high standards of evidence for sexual exploitation; she was less than a person in law and society, and so her testimony did not matter. An indentured woman at least has that *potential*, that implicit recognition, to seek justice for wrongdoing. So even when you are getting these abuses, they are combined with some level of recognition that they are somehow deviant and wrong; there are even contemporaries who had no problem with how slaves were treated who expressed grievance at how white servants were treated at times.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that these two systems existed *together*, at the same time. There is debate over whether Africans began working in the early colonial period as slaves or as indentured servants first, but certainly by the mid-17th Century Africans were very much working as and treated as in law slaves - distinct in the mind of contemporaries from servants. Indenture actually continues (in greatly diminished form) well into the 19th Century and makes a significant return in the British Caribbean that persists until the early 20th Century; historians view that incarnation of indenture, which mainly featured Indian and Chinese workers (though a very small handful of Europeans may have been indentured after 1838), as fundamentally different to slavery as well. The only form of indenture some historians are generally willing to recognise as being a form of slavery is the practice of apprenticeship in the British Caribbean, which existed from 1834 to 1838. This was still a substantially different system though in that apprentices (all of who were ex-slaves indentured for a fixed period; all were supposed to be freed by 1840, but the British government intervened in 1838 in response to abuses by the plantation owners) were paid for their work, children could not (or rather *should* not) have been victims of it, and it was a temporary arrangement with a promise of freedom at the end.\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, you *can* make an argument that indentured servitude was a kind of white slavery - you can argue a lot of things are a kind of slavery. Some social scientists today would do just that, and use the term 'slavery' to describe all kinds of forms of unfree labour that exist today (estimates for modern-day slavery vary wildly depending on your methodology). Historians, and especially labour historians like myself whose interests lie in unpicking these very complicated systems and seeing what makes them tick, are generally very reluctant to do that; we would generally emphasise that slavery is a very specific and distinct system. With indenture, Hilary Beckles - who is a very prominent historian - generally describes it as a kind of \"proto-slavery\"; it's not slavery proper, but it does develop some of its features in practice. Likewise, some of the institutions that were created to enforce it do help to facilitate the later enforcement of mass slavery. But it is a fundamentally different system in its construction, and calling it 'white slavery' really misses the nuances and complexities of what slavery is.\n\nGenerally, we use the term 'unfree labour' - or similar terms like 'bonded labour' or 'coercive labour' - to describe indenture and slavery together, as well as all kinds of other practices. Freedom is complex and dynamic; people are not simply 'free' or 'not free', and the idea that indentured servitude is the same as slavery tends to arise from viewing freedom in that fashion. Rather, freedom is a relationship between people and like any relationship, it has many different forms and variations. Indentured servants certainly weren't free in the way you or I might describe ourselves as free people today, but nor were they slaves.

No disrespect intended to you whatsoever - you should *absolutely* expect the National Archives to put out content better than this - but it is *awful*.\n\nGiven the emotions this subject often arouses, I'd like to just be clear in the interests of full disclosure before I go on: I grew up in an Irish-Italian Catholic household and I was raised in a community where basically everyone was a descendant of Irish migrants, so I'm very sympathetic in myself to the idea of trying to recover the experience of Irish indenture. Obviously no-one has to take my word for that, but I would just like to preface with that in the interests of transparency.\n\nNow, this is *really* bad history on the part of the National Archives and it upsets me pretty horrendously. I honest to God don't know how that blog post got published. I mean, take this line from the opening:\n\n> a chance phone call from a community group in Birmingham led to the uncovering of a remarkable hidden history of Irish servants or indentured labour being employed on English owned plantations in the Caribbean\n\nThere is literally nothing remarkable or hidden about indentured labour. For some reason, the author doesn't seem to clock that even though he quotes Dunn (1973) and Beckles (1990) on the topic. Historians have talked about the history of indenture, including Irish indenture, for literally *decades* now. It is grossly misleading to imply that in 2013 the author just randomly 'uncovered' this history. This is, to an extent, the problem with archives. Whilst it is absolutely fantastic and so important that they are available to anyone who would like to make use of them, their records can also end up being used uncritically, superficially and without proper scrutiny if people are not properly qualified (and by 'qualified' I mean trained in the historical method, not necessarily in the sense that they have a degree - some really outstanding work has always been and continues to be done by researchers without formal qualifications).\n\nMuch more alarmingly, he's also plagiarised content from actual historians. You see this passage here?\n\n> Moreover, John Scott, an English adventurer who travelled in the West Indies during the Commonwealth, saw Irish servants working in field gangs with slaves, \u201cwithout stockings under the scorching sun\u201d. The Irish, he wrote, were \u201cderided by the negroes, and branded with the Epithet of \u2018white slaves\u2019\u201d^3\n\nThis is lifted from a journal article by Hilary Beckles, almost word for word:\n\n> John Scott, an English adventurer who traveled [sic] in the West Indies during the Commonwealth, saw them working in field gangs with slaves, \"without stockings\" under the \"scorching sun.\" The Irish, he wrote, were \"derided by the negroes, and branded with the Epithet of 'white slaves.\"'^22\n\n> **^Source: ^Hilary ^Beckles, ^\"A ^\"riotous ^and ^unruly ^lot\": ^Irish ^Indentured ^Servants ^and ^Freemen ^in ^the ^English ^West ^Indies, ^1644 ^- ^1713\", *^The ^William ^and ^Mary ^Quarterly* ^47, ^no. ^4 ^(1990) ^: ^p511.**\n\nThat footnote in the National Archives article though, doesn't refer to Beckles' book - it refers to the reference *in Beckles' book*. Essentially, he's taken Beckles' work and then tried to make it look as though he went about doing it. You'll notice, though, that he hasn't taken his quote from the original source material: he's taken it from Beckles. In the 1990 article, the quoted words from the text are \"without stockings\" and \"scorching sun\"; it is Beckles who has written \"under the\" to join these two things together, those words do not appear in the original text; he is bridging together two different observations to make the article flow better. But Mahoney just has a single \"without stockings under the scorching sun\", implying the words \"under the\" come from the original text when they do not.\n\nNow, that might seem really pedantic and nitpicky of me to point out - but it's incredibly significant. Mahoney has not done his own research but he is *pretending* that he has; he might not mean to do it maliciously, but no historian would do that for fear of being accused of plagiarism. Understand that this is different to when people on AskHistorians disseminate knowledge; if they quote from a historian, they're going to say so, and whilst we don't footnote where we get every single idea from, we can direct you to what's helped informed that idea and we don't pass it off as our own original research unless it is. In this case it really is plagiarism - and the thing about plagiarism is that, even if it's innocent, when detected you immediately have to question *every other reference*. This is why universities hammer undergraduates so hard on learning how to reference properly and thoroughly. Likewise, the fact that his quote comes from Beckles and *not* from the original source material implies he didn't *actually* go back to the original material or look at it in any depth. So you have to really question not only his knowledge of the subject matter but also his ability to construct an argument from primary source material. This is a very, very badly put together article.\n\nIt's also, for the record, plagiarised content being used to argue something Beckles himself strong disagrees with:\n\n> White slavery ended in Europe during the Middle Ages, but the same period saw a growing use of slave labour among Africans in Africa, and this in turn led to the increasing use of enslaved Africans in the Mediterranean and in Europe. **This meant that while the white labour used in the European colonization of the East-Atlantic islands and the Americas was not enslaved, even if it was bonded in various ways, the black African labour used was slave labour**. (*Slave Voyages: The Transatlantic Trade in Africans*) [emphasis mine]\n\nNow, I don't happen to have the original version of that particular source (*Some Observations on the Island of Barbados*, 1667) to hand; I seem to have in my files an 1880 transcription which reports to be copied from the original source. The version I have reads like this instead:\n\n> Not above 760 considerable proprietors and 8,000 effective men, of which two-thirds are of no reputation and little courage, and a very great part Irish, derided by the negroes as white slaves [...] inspected many plantations and seen 30 or 40 English, Scotch, and Irish at work in the parching sun, without shirt, shoe, or stocking, and negroes at their trades in good condition\n\nNow, there is a subtle but significant distinction to be made here. Scott is not singling out the Irish - he is merely noting that demographically, many of these white servants were Irish, but that they were *in general* derided as 'white slaves'; but Scott is also emphasising that there are Englishmen and Scottishmen involved as well. Unfortunately, I can't go back to the National Archives right this second to try and piece together which is the more faithful representation of the original text, but there do not seem to be significant differences in the phrasing - it's things like \"parching\" being \"scorching\" (which could easily be a misreading of the handwriting), or subtly different phrasing. So Scott doesn't seem to be singling out the Irish quite in the same way it's been implied; he's certainly conscious that they're disproportionately victims of this system but he also emphasises that English and Scottish people are, too.\n\nOne of the big problems in the use of this source, though, is that it's being used very uncritically for two reasons. One, as Beckles goes discusses in his article, Barbados is exceptional - and that's something that's true throughout Caribbean history. Barbados is very good at making itself stand out in the historical record. It's a colony where the plantocracy achieves an unusually strong, relentless system of control and domination from *very* early on in the colonial period; many of the elites on other colonies look to it for inspiration in that regard. Before, during and after slavery's abolition, the planters on Barbados are profoundly and unusually powerful and exploitative. You cannot neatly extrapolate from Barbados and explain other colonies.\n\nThe other is that it assumes almost that black workers were laughing at white slaves as being below them. I'm really not sure that's the case at all; rather, it seems much more likely that the \"white slave\" epithet was about saying \"look at you, you're not so different to us, you're not better than us, you're just like us, you're white slaves\". It's a very salient and intuitive critique of the racial hierarchy that was developing in the 17th Century. One of the other terms we see used is \"po' white buckra\" (or 'backra'); 'buckra' is a term that appears in slave vernacular and it's basically a slur, but it's usually interpreted as having connotations of implied (and laughable) superiority; 'backra' in Jamaican patois essentially means 'slave master' and is used to refer derogatorily to white people in positions of authority (to have \"someone working like you're a real backra\" basically means \"work someone like you're a slave driver\"). So this is really, I would argue, an oversimplification of what Scott is observing. These Irish victims aren't be laughed at because they're Irish and even the Irish are below black slaves; rather, they're being laughed at because they're *white* and they're *poor*. It reflects an understanding of the social reality in Caribbean society: to be white is to be free powerful, to be black is to be unfree and not powerful, and white people who are not powerful or free are trapped in a strange world.\n\nNow, I'm at the limit and I still need to substantially address your actual argument and the rest of the blog post which I'll do in Part 2, but it might take me a little while to get it up because the boyfriend's about to get back from work.

I wanted to substantially address the blog because it seemed to be the key source you were using, and I wouldn't want you or anyone else taking that particular writer's very flawed work as good scholarship. Again, that is not a criticism of you - the National Archvies blog should absolutely be reliable and sound as a quick reference, and it's extremely disappointing that it wasn't. You just had the misfortune of finding a bad mark on what is otherwise a very good resource.\n\nNow, to answer your follow up there directly: yes, there were Irish people who were sent involuntarily to the New World as indentured servants. The first immediate caveat to throw in there is: so were *a lot* of Scottish people and so were *a lot* of English people. Involuntary white indenture should absolutely not be mistaken for a system that *only* targeted the Irish; it was a broader experience. Likewise, there were certainly Irish servants who went willingly to the New World as authentic participants in voluntary contracts. So we should be careful to not assume too much about the Irish angle there, as some people have tried to do - in 1687 Irish people constituted less than 20% of the population of the Leeward Islands. But yes, certainly there were white and particularly Irish people who were sent to the British Caribbean as indentured servants against their will.\n\nThis does not always mean that they were *forcefully* moved to the British Caribbean, though, in the sense that they were taken physically against their will. In fact, far more common was the practice of trying to deceive Irish labourers into traveling to the New World with fantastical stories of great working conditions and outstanding opportunity. We see in contemporary rhetoric that the servant trade did not look to Ireland because it saw the Irish as *inherently* degraded in quite the same way the slave trade came to see Africans as essentially less than Human; rather, traders saw Ireland as a state struggling with high unemployment, widespread poverty and civil unrest. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that they saw in Ireland a culture of *desperation* rather than depravity, where it was easy to portray the West Indies as a promised land of salvation.\n\nFor their part, historians also emphasise the agency of the Irish in these deals: they appear - as other voluntary servants in Britain did - to have accepted the promise of opportunity, but not as a whole bought into the fantasy of working conditions in the Caribbean being fine and dandy. There is a temptation among Irish slave mythers to paint the story in this way, and it's inherently classist in my view: just because these people were economically disadvantaged does not mean they were unintelligent or unintuitive. Many went clearly aware that it would be hard work in hard conditions, but went anyway in the hope of building a better future or returning home with wealth for their family. They were still certainly deceived but we should not presume they bought into that deceit blindly, and emerged into the New World as passive, totally unsuspecting victims.\n\nHaving said that, Cromwell absolutely did specifically order the sending of Irishmen to Barbados as indentured servants - although he also singled out some English and Scottish victims, the Irish suffered disproportionately under this policy. This was a policy profoundly unpopular with the Caribbean colonial leadership, who didn't particularly *want* Irish workers - the ascent of African slave labour was already well under way, and some colonies actively tried to *stop* Irish workers from being brought into their territory because they saw them as lazy and incompetent. The preference for Caribbean planters in white servants was overwhelmingly for Scottish Protestants first, English or Welsh workers second, and the Irish last.\n\nMany of the harsh features of Caribbean treatment of Irish servants stems not from a desire to create a malleable and obedient workforce but to deal with a perceived political and social problem. The Irish were overwhelmingly Catholic at a time when Britain was engaged in regular hostilities with Catholic powers; her colonies were gripped with fear that the Irish might unify with the French or with the Spanish and undermine the security of the colonies. Experiences of the colonial project in Ireland had helped to instil a fear that the Irish were naturally rebellious and resentful of the English and of Protestantism, and Caribbean authorities acted accordingly to tackle the perceived threat of revolt and to make their colonies undesirable destinations for migration. Whilst white servants certainly did suffer under oppressive laws and practices, the specific burdens on the Irish have less to do with a desire to create a labour force and much more to do with protecting the position of the Protestant elite. Irish Protestant, it's worth noting, generally fared better than Irish Catholics.\n\nBut the Irish experience was not one of uniform degradation, either. If we look to Montserrat, we can find a colony in which the Irish fulfilled every role imaginable in society; indentured servitude was genuinely a path of mobility for many who arrived there. Many Irish migrants there would go on to careers in politics, religion and community leadership; indeed, Montserrat becomes home to a large community of Irish African slave-owners who, it must be emphasised, demonstrate remarkable harshness in the treatment of their Human property. In that colony, Irish planters broadly appear to have led the resistance to demands for improving conditions of slaves more than the English planters - they were every bit as happy to exploit and degrade as English planters were and clearly as a whole had little to no sense of solidarity with victims of slavery (whilst there were similarly black slave owners in the United States, we are talking about a much smaller minority, very few of who were exploitative in the same way - many so-called black slave owners were the owners of family members they could not legally emancipate). Montserrat is exceptional but there were Irish labourers and migrants who managed to break through into the echelons of power even in Barbados, where their treatment was at its harshest. Whilst they were victims of the apparatus of imperial power, the Irish - and indentured servants in general - could also benefit from it and insert themselves into a position of power within it; that possibility simply did not exist for slaves or black people.\n\nNow, your broader theoretical point seems to be this: people were taken against their will to work somewhere else, and that makes what happened to them enslavement. That's not an unreasonable way of looking at it but historians reject that as a criteria for understanding slavery. Coercion is an absolutely essential part of slavery, yes - you cannot have slavery without psychological and physical violence. But you can have a variety of systems of unfree labour that involve coercion. Indeed, one of the chief criticisms levied against Kevin Bales, a scholar who advocates for a very broad definition of slavery, is that by his very broad framework women have, for most of history, been slaves to men in most cultures. Most of us would agree that that's not the case even if women have been subject to extreme oppression and disadvantage.\n\nOrlando Patterson offers one of the most famous examples of a theoretical construction of slavery; within his framework, slavery is essentially a substitution for death. He describes it as a kind of \"social death\" in which the slave is artificially removed from all recognition of their family and cultural heritage; in which there is absolutely *no* social existence for the enslaved individual outside of their master. Their identity becomes irrelevant and is considered destroyed, expected to be substituted by an identity focused on service to their owner. They are completely excluded from society *except through their owner*. If a slave wants property, it is by consent of his owner. If he wants to marry, it is by consent of his owner that the union is recognised. If he wants to keep his children, it is by consent of his owner. If he wants to have a life outside of his work of any kind, it is by consent of his owner. This is not a legal reality - it is a *social* reality, a relationship between two people and between them and wider society. There are flaws in Patterson's definition, certainly - it tends to lead to a downplaying of agency on the part of the victim - but it captures the essence of why slavery is a unique form of domination quite well.\n\nThis is actually, as something of an aside, where the argument that historians are too reliant on legal definitions - which you alluded to earlier - rather breaks down; until about the mid 17th Century, slavery was *not* defined in law as being distinct from indenture. Rather, what we see is that the *social reality*, the practical differences in how black people and white servants are treated, gives slavery its form despite no legal basis. When Virginia starts to pass the first laws dealing explicitly with black slaves in the 1660s, not only is it made clear they do not apply to white servants, but they are explicitly framed as resolving \"doubts\" in civil society over whether black people are servants or slaves. Practice is not informed by the law in this situation; rather, the law evolves to reflect practice on the ground that black people were being treated as slaves whilst white labourers were not.", "id": "czpd4mu"}, {"comment": "(3 of 3)\n\nWhite servants did not suffer the same kind of exclusion that broadly characterises slavery. As a postcolonial critic might put it, though they were marginalised they were not necessarily subaltern; they were at the very least had the potential for acceptance by the colonial power structure - their personage and identity continued to be recognised both in law and in culture, even if their employers tried to undermine it. They did not suffer the total, institutionalised degradation and dehumanisation that African slaves did. Montserrat is a very real example of how even white Irish people - who did suffer more than most white servants - were very much able to access institutions of power and themselves become agents of oppression, exploitation and imperialism in a way that was simply not open to enslaved Africans even after they were emancipated. Indeed, one Irish Catholic, William Stapleton, served for 7 years as Governor-General of the Leeward Islands - he himself had been interred in the kind of prison from which many servants were sent under Cromwell (though he went to the Caribbean as a soldier). Within servitude, their condition of unfreedom was always understood to be a temporal abnormality, their legal identity remained intact and their legal rights could be enforced. And it should be stressed that many servants *did* succeed in getting justice through the courts for wrongdoings committed against them - whilst society contrived ways to deny them that process, it remained theoretically open to all, and plausibly open to some. Slaves simply do not have that kind of identity or entitlement, nor the capacity to access institutions of power and exploitation. They were, as Patterson put it, socially dead.\n\nThe removal of Africans from their home context is particularly significant, as well. Though the Caribbean was a strange place for all involved, white servants were at least going to a part of the world where they shared a cultural heritage with their exploiters; they shared language, history, religion, philosophy and other cultural markers and experiences. A white indentured servant could understand his master's language, appreciate his religion even if he did not share the denomination, and had an understanding of the relationship between them expected by society; they could expect a similar relationship with their fellow servants. They had the potential to settle in a community with their own during and after indenture, or even to return home in some situations. African slaves on the other hand were completely isolated from their home culture and placed into another one as absolute outsiders, seen as incapable of ever really earning admission to that culture; even their descendants if they became free people of colour could not hope for proper admission to institutions of cultural creation and dissemination in the same way the descendants of white servants could. Even among themselves slaves arrived from Africa would not necessarily have common identity - they would often have different religious practices, speak different languages, come from different communities and so on. In the New World many slaves could not forge an identity based on common heritage as they would have understood it in Africa; rather, they had to build a new one based on the one experience they did have in common - enslavement and racial degradation.\n\nThese legal and cultural distinctions, incidentally, go beyond the relationship between master and servant; they also extend to the relationship between servant and slave. We see that in the late 17th Century in Barbados for example, the death penalty is applicable to any slave found stealing from *any* white person's property - and that includes Irish indentured servants. Laws concerning slaves and servants from the mid-17th Century onwards were very careful to try and articulate explicit distinctions between the two. Irish Catholic servants for example, though seen to be inferior to English Protestants, were still recognised as Christian men and women - in 1681, Barbados passed a law explicitly stating that African slaves could not even be Christians, and throughout the New World we see this idea emerging in the 17th Century that Africans are not capable of a truly *authentic* Christian belief like that of Europeans. Likewise, colonial laws governing discipline and correction readily sanction much more grievous treatment of slaves than servants. So there's much more to the legal construction - which in turn grew out of the social reality (most of these complex laws emerge long *after* indenture and slavery have been practised substantially and represent the codification, not the modification, of existing practice) - than simply the elite saying \"you are slaves, you are servants\". The language in legal constructs of the distinction between the two help us to understand how contemporaries saw the differences.\n\nSomething that gets overlooked in contemporaries describing the treatment of some servants as \"like slaves\" is the implication to the statement beneath the superficial. When these protests are made by contemporaries, they are almost never protesting the existence of slavery itself - rather, they are insisting that white people must be treated better *because they are not slaves*. Culturally and socially, a white person simply could not and should not be a slave certainly by the end of the 17th Century; that was a degradation and humiliation reserved exclusively for Africans and their descendants (I'm sidestepping Native American experience her partly out of necessity because I've talked long enough as it is and it's obviously less sharply relevant to the Caribbean than continental America). These critics were not saying \"slavery is horrid and wrong and it's happening to white people too\"; they were saying \"these people are not slaves, we must do more to protect their rights\". They would simply not have thought to make the same defence of Africans who did not have rights; who were outsiders completely excluded from society. It was a rhetorical tactic used to draw attention to the abuses of servitude in a way that it was hoped would arouse disgust in the mind of contemporaries who increasingly understood *slave* as synonymous with *black* - it was generally an argument for the amelioration of indentured servants, rather than for the improvement of conditions for slaves or the total abolition of either system.\n\nAs stated earlier, slavery is more complicated than simply not being free; many people around the world are substantially unfree without being slaves in a fashion comparable to the black or native slaves of the New World. Historians seek to understand complexity, nuance and the systems of the past as they were understood by contemporaries; it is for this reason that we are often much, much more careful in who we call a 'slave' than a social scientist challenging modern-day unfree labour might be (where using a liberal definition of 'slave' can be a useful rhetorical device precisely because it conjurs up images of the abuses of transatlantic slavery). We want to understand these systems as authentically as we can, and part of that is being very careful in how we conceptualise and frame our analysis of them. None of this is to deny the very real suffering faced by so many indentured servants in the Caribbean and the Americas; it is simply to emphasise that they were not victims of the same processes and the same system that Africans were, even if there were resemblances.\n\n**Selected bibliography**\n\n* Hilary Beckles and Verene Shepherd, *Caribbean Freedom: Economy and Society from Emancipation to the Present* (1996).\n* Hilary Beckles, *White Servitude and Black Slavery in Barbados 1627 - 1715* (1990).\n* Donald Akenson, *If the Irish Ran the World: Montserrat, 1630 - 1730* (1997).\n* Kristen Block and Jenny Shaw, *Subjects Without an Empire: The Irish in the Early Modern Caribbean* (2011).\n* Jenny Shaw, *Everyday Life in the Early English Caribbean: Irish, Africans, and the Construction of Difference* (2013).\n* David Brion Davis, *The Making of New World Slavery: From the Baroque to the Modern, 1492 - 1800* (1997).\n* Philip Morgan and Bernard Bailyn, *Strangers Within the Realm: Cultural Margins of the First British Empire* (1991).\n* Orlando Patterson, *Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study* (1982).\n* Jean Allain, *The Legal Understanding of Slavery: From the Historical to the Contemporary* (2012).\n* Riva Berlant-Shiller, \"Free Labour and the Economy in Seventeenth-Century Montserrat,\" *The William and Mary Quarterly* 46, no. 3 (1989): 539 - 564.\n* Hilary Beckles, \"A \"riotous and unruly lot\": Irish Indentured Servants and Freemen in the English West Indies, 1644 - 1713\", *The William and Mary Quarterly* 47, no. 4 (1990): 503 - 522.", "id": "czpdk1j"}, {"comment": "Thanks for this, Sowser.", "id": "czpee2a"}, {"comment": "Thank you for an extremely detailed (understatement), response.

As others have pointed out, there are some problems with the Trans-Atlantic slave trade parallels, but let me take a different tact with this question and look at the early modern period's interaction between Barbary Coast corsairs and American and European prisoners, specifically with the story of James Leander Cathcart.\n\nMr. Cathcart had participated in the Revolutionary War as a Privateer (tender age of 15 or so) and post-War became a ship captain transporting lumber and other agricultural products to markets in the Mediterranean when his ship was captured by the Barbary Coast Corsairs operating out of Algeria.\n\nCathcart and his crew were held for ransom, but as low-profile prisoners, their release wasn't happening anytime soon. During captivity, Cathcart was 'selected' to be the personal zoo keeper of the local Dey who, Cathcart reports, ordered that he receive received regular beatings (bastinado) to the point where he permanently lost some of his toenails. However, his treatment, by and large, wasn't nearly that bad consistently; he used that position to learn a smattering of Turkish and Arabic and eventually became a secretary for the very prisons in which his crew were being held. \n\nSo far, Cathcart's story seems to be analogous to black slaves in America, but this quickly changes and the analogy falls apart:\n\nHe used his position and privilege to pay for better (and more) food for his crewmates as well as purchased a house, hired servants, and even owned a tavern or two. He becomes a highly-trusted and valued translator and advisor to the Dey. Eventually, the United States signed the Treaty of Algiers with the Barbary Coast powers and Cathcart was released as part of the deal. He sold all his Algerian possessions and rounded up his crew, sailing back to America. Cathcart would eventually return to the Barbary Coast as a diplomat, but this is outside the scope of your question.\n\nMore to the point of your question; yes, white Europeans/Americans *were* taken as prisoners (I would hesitate to say \"slaves\") and treated poorly, but there is really no equivalent to the way that Africans were treated in the Americas. You'll note that Cathcart's treatment was unusual even within the context of his own tale; while he was working, his crewmates languished in a kind of prison awaiting ransom. Indeed, most crews were ransomed in this period and, until the end of the Second Barbary Coast War, this was a common practice; the prisoners were more valuable as ransom than as slaves. More difficult to discern from Cathcart's anecdotal stories is the way in which slaves were treated; physical punishment - even severe beatings - were common in a lot of societies (just try being an offender on one of His Majesty's naval ships) and Cathcart makes these beatings seem random and arbitrary (which they *could* be, but most likely aren't). Also, Cathcart very quickly comes to secure his own property, had servants of his own, and operated businesses; I cannot think of a single slave in the Americas who has a similar experience *before* emancipation. All in all, Cathcart's experience is a-typical at best and possibly unique.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about Cathcart, I recommend his book \"[The Captives: Eleven Years a Prisoner in Algiers] (https://archive.org/details/captives00cathrich)\" which was compiled and printed by Cathcart's daughter well after the ordeal. \n\nA more interesting question, and examination, of poor treatment of \"White\" slaves would be when Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland and sent tens of thousands of Irish Catholics into slavery in [Barbados and the Caribbean] (https://youtu.be/PSlOSXZ9TCI?t=531). Irish, for most of modern British history, were barely considered human and so might come closest to poor treatment and slavery that parallels the Black experience in the Americas (but even *that* falls apart as the Irish integrate, change religion, and move to the provinces).

The being said, European administrators would still have been the norm.\n\nClothing wise, the film was shot in Morocco and [the clothing on the \"Egyptian\" peasants looks like they just grabbed modern Moroccan extras.](https://www.google.ae/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fvignette3.wikia.nocookie.net%2Fmummy%2Fimages%2F8%2F85%2FThe-Mummy-1999-the-mummy-movies-4380732-960-536-1-.jpg%2Frevision%2Flatest%3Fcb%3D20091128212427&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmummy.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FTen_Plagues_of_Egypt&docid=-Fg3mMns69Ts-M&tbnid=oCIj3xCFTZjf4M%3A&w=960&h=536&ved=0ahUKEwiO-5Wa2IjMAhUD0xQKHa2JDX4QMwggKAUwBQ&iact=mrc&uact=8) Those thick brown woolen robes are more typical of north-west Africa (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco) than an Egyptian peasant' galabiya, which tends to be thinner.

Stocks does do trials with the bores on granite and gets great results with a diorite grinding stone. I also mentioned that Stocks' other article goes more into experimentation with granite.

That does not seem to be the case with this one. Sadly the Egyptian Museum has no database to speak of, but the vessel in the video (also in the web site, yes?) appears to be calcite. Different shaped borers could create the curves of its neck (much like different lathe heads), and the calcite's softness would make the handle not challenging.

The absence of black competitors was another issue, one much more like the US case, based on segregation and white supremacy.  Oddly enough, before the Act of Union, two Tswana men (Len Taunyane and Jan Mashiani) possibly from the Free State did in fact compete in the 1904 Olympics, in the marathon.  So it wasn't completely unknown--but it's worth pointing out that both weren't supposed to compete and hadn't gone to St. Louis for that purpose but were, instead, part of a \"war exhibit\" and re-enactment show (a variation on the human zoo).  Somehow they managed to get into the event anyhow, and placed ninth and twelfth. [edit/add: [photo here from the MO History Museum](http://collections.mohistory.org/resource/141407.html), although we don't know a huge amount about them.]\n\nEventually, SA were not permitted to compete in 1964, following growing demands for the desegregation of sport. By 1968 it was not possible for South Africa to participate without the specter of massive boycotts from other former colonial nations, especially once it was clear they would never agree to desegregate by 1972.  This is all very oversimplified, but points to the centrality of white supremacy to SA's Olympic attitudes up until SANOC was banned by the IOC in 1970. (They were allowed to return in 1992.)\n\nAnother interesting question involves Ethiopia's participation--even though the Kingdom was recognized as an independent and sovereign state by treaty in 1896 (after the victory at Adwa), they did not actually participate in the Olympics until 1956.

Summers, a colonel during the Vietnam War, argues that the United States could have won the war if it had declared war on North Vietnam and destroyed the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).  As /u/Nate20ASU notes, Summers considers the Vietcong to have been a \"symptom\" of the NVA (the work cited here was published in the mid 1980s, well before the modern consensus on Vietnam coalesced, it should be noted).  Some modern historians, however, such as Robert Brigham, argue that the war was not winnable at all in part because Americans in general (i.e., both Lyndon Johnson who escalated the war and analysts like Summers who supposedly present a contradictory view to Johnson) mistakenly believed that the Vietcong's efforts to drive out what they perceived to be imperialists was really an arm of the North Vietnamese efforts to conquer South Vietnam.  Brigham concludes that the United States never had a chance to win the war because it misunderstood the enemy's nationalism as a machination of communism (i.e., that Hanoi controlled the Vietcong entirely), because it fought in a terrain that favored this nationalistic enemy (i.e., a jungle that they knew well), and because the United States never had the option of waging a full-blown war because of Vietnam's proximity to China (as /u/Nate20ASU notes).\n\nWhile these are not the only two analysts of the war, it should be noted that Summers' *On Strategy* particularly appealed to soldiers and others who believed that the United States *should* have won the war and that Johnson, Nixon, and other leaders screwed the army out of a deserved win.  Most of modern scholarship posits this as an incorrect, nationalist perspective.  There is, however, a true scholarly work that promotes this view: Mark Moyar's *Triumph Forsaken,* which was supposed to be part one of a two part series, but which drew so much attention and criticism that it became a major work in itself and Moyar has yet to write the second volume, which was, ironically I'd say, supposed to be the major book out of the two.    "], [4, "There isn't a \"main reason.\" \n\nThe problem with the Vietnam War was never a question about outright military strength. If that was the case the Vietnam War would have ended rather quickly, and probably at an incredible cost. Though I don't necessarily agree with Keith Taylor (a rather well known revisionist scholar), the US were indeed winning every strategic defense within Vietnam. One could argue that Operation Rolling Thunder actually *achieved* its goals, which was to destroy the infrastructure and production capacity of North Vietnam.\n\nThe problem however was that the US could never invade North Vietnam from 1961-1969 mainly due to the direct backing and stance of China which officially made clear that China would not turn away from a provocation. In other words, invading past the agreed parallel in the Geneva Accords would have essentially resulted in WWIII. Likewise, most of the Aid sent to North Vietnam was by China until the late 60s. Much of the aid came in the form of munitions, anti-aircraft crews, engineers, road-builders, and vehicles. The majority of that equipment thanks to the rather pragmatic dealings of the North Vietnamese at the time came from China despite both China and the Soviet Union post Sino-Soviet Split vying for the attention of the DRV.\n\nThe other problem occurred after the Tet Offensive in 1968. Though the Tet undoubtedly resulted in a loss for the Viet Cong, the United States couldn't offer a counteroffensive for fear of an even larger escalation of the war. Strategically the Tet Offensive and the resulting attempts to reclaim central Vietnam brought to light a slew of rather unpleasant happenings to the American public. Of which included the My Lai Massacre and the general lack of cooperation of the South Vietnamese which had been a continual problem since the Ngo Dinh Diem and after his assassination in 1964.\n\nI would suggest that a good way of trying to understand why the US failed to win the Vietnam War would be to view the US as not the primary actor, but the patron and benefactor of the South Vietnamese. Though Orthodox scholars have a habit of describing the South as corrupt and incompetent for good reason, the opposite spectrum of the Vietnam War scholarship tends to describe the US as limited by both its domestic policy and the military having \"one hand tied behind their back.\"\n\nWhat both schools tend to miss are the political complexities that affected both North and South. Though the North had more stable leadership, despite a centralized government it too faced serious issues especially during the planning of the Tet Offensive. Likewise, the spy networks that were set up to infiltrate the North by the CIA were woefully inadequate in comparison to the Soviet trained Northern Spies. Despite all this, the standard of living and quality of life was abundantly better in the South. During the 1954 open border season, more than 2 million North Vietnamese fled to the South causing an enormous refugee crisis. The answer to why the US didn't win can't be answered by merely viewing the military and tactical mistakes. The distinct regionalism combined with international geopolitics only created more obstacles along with the more overt lack of cooperation within the South. In tandem with what seemed to be an unclear goal for victory and a very successful insurgency via the Viet Cong, the US's original thoughts of a Conventional War soon gave way to conflict that required the US to understand not only the regional politics of both sides, but also understand the culture and people of a nation and area of which the US had no idea about.\n\nIn hindsight Vietnamization and the escalation via the bombing of Cambodia by Nixon proved an abject failure. If there was one constant failure that I would point out by the US during the Vietnam War, it would be the paradoxically detached but intense involvement the US had within the RVN's internal politics and military. Confronted with political inertia and a fear of escalation that echoed the Korean War (as well as war fatigue from the American populace which had witnessed nearly 20 years of warfare), politically speaking the Vietnam War by 1973 was no longer viable. Even if the US had decided to stay, the progressive transition towards Vietnamization would not have stemmed the huge hole left by the rapid and alarming reduction of aid towards South Vietnam after 1973.\n\nIn short I would suggest that the US couldn't win because the war wasn't a war for the United States. The goal in the end was unification, and the support of the RVN (Republic of Vietnam) by the United States shouldn't be viewed as a war that the US fought for the US as much as it was an extended and heavily involved aid process for South Vietnam. Combined with a lack of understanding of the intricacies of the war and battlefield that continued to be propagated through the AVRN's high command (who were all US trained), victory became a longer and longer prospect.\n\nPS: I should include a lot more primary sources, but outside of a few key notes from journalists within the South Vietnamese government, North Vietnamese sources are particularly difficult to parse, especially since most of them are in Hanoi or Da Lat and generally in Vietnamese and censored.\n\nSources:\n\n1.

When MacArthur advanced to close the Yalu River during the war, China eventually gave pursuit of the United States. One the issues in Vietnam was again, the fact that North Vietnam bordered China, so the United States played this safely during much of the war. \n\nTo answer your question as to why the U.S. lost the war, there's a variety of different reasons. One reason is the beginning strategy enacted by Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, who believed in what was called the \"body count\" strategy. Essentially these were missions designed to count the number of North Vietnamese killed in the war. The problem with this however, is the fact that one, it's impossible to know how many enemies were killed by a napalm bomb, and two, soldiers would inflate the number killed. Another issue as to why the U.S. lost, was the fact that they tried to fight a war of attrition. This was a strategy used by commander, William Westmoreland, which eventually led to a stalemate in the Vietnam War. Finally, and perhaps the biggest issue in war, was the fact that the U.S. fought mostly a symptom of the war. This symptom of course was the Viet Cong, the guerrilla fighters in the war. These were the soldiers we are more accustomed to seeing in modern depictions of the Vietnam War such as the movie \"We Were Soldiers\", which depicts the Ia Drang Offensive. These guerrila fighters were a symptom of the war, that the United States dedicated much of the war effort towards, which made the U.S. take the strategic defensive. Adding onto these strategic failures by the U.S. forces, Vietnam had no infrastructure making it impossible to destroy supply routes, or caravans as the military did in World War II. All of these issues added onto why the U.S. lost. \n\nPerhaps the best book I've read for this is \"On Strategy\" by Harry Summers. Summer's goes into great detail about how issues at home, North Vietnamese nationalism, and how strategic failures all caused the loss in Vietnam."]], [[{"comment": "It has to be pointed out that the book cited by /u/Nate20ASU does not promote the consensus view of the Vietnam War but instead puts forward what many analysts consider to be a myth of the Vietnam War.  Summers, a colonel during the Vietnam War, argues that the United States could have won the war if it had declared war on North Vietnam and destroyed the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).  As /u/Nate20ASU notes, Summers considers the Vietcong to have been a \"symptom\" of the NVA (the work cited here was published in the mid 1980s, well before the modern consensus on Vietnam coalesced, it should be noted).  Some modern historians, however, such as Robert Brigham, argue that the war was not winnable at all in part because Americans in general (i.e., both Lyndon Johnson who escalated the war and analysts like Summers who supposedly present a contradictory view to Johnson) mistakenly believed that the Vietcong's efforts to drive out what they perceived to be imperialists was really an arm of the North Vietnamese efforts to conquer South Vietnam.  Brigham concludes that the United States never had a chance to win the war because it misunderstood the enemy's nationalism as a machination of communism (i.e., that Hanoi controlled the Vietcong entirely), because it fought in a terrain that favored this nationalistic enemy (i.e., a jungle that they knew well), and because the United States never had the option of waging a full-blown war because of Vietnam's proximity to China (as /u/Nate20ASU notes).\n\nWhile these are not the only two analysts of the war, it should be noted that Summers' *On Strategy* particularly appealed to soldiers and others who believed that the United States *should* have won the war and that Johnson, Nixon, and other leaders screwed the army out of a deserved win.  Most of modern scholarship posits this as an incorrect, nationalist perspective.  There is, however, a true scholarly work that promotes this view: Mark Moyar's *Triumph Forsaken,* which was supposed to be part one of a two part series, but which drew so much attention and criticism that it became a major work in itself and Moyar has yet to write the second volume, which was, ironically I'd say, supposed to be the major book out of the two.    ", "id": "d4cd1go"}, {"comment": "I'm not an especially huge fan of Moyar's *Triumph Forsaken*. Primarily due to his very very clear anti-Johnson stance, but also because he tends to take a very apologetic stance towards the US military and frames the victory of the Vietnam War as a US v NVA war. Though that is not an illogical view, I find that Moyar does little with regards of inspecting a component I consider essential in understanding the Vietnam War: the political agency of both the North Vietnamese and the South Vietnamese.", "id": "d4cel07"}], [{"comment": "There isn't a \"main reason.\" \n\nThe problem with the Vietnam War was never a question about outright military strength. If that was the case the Vietnam War would have ended rather quickly, and probably at an incredible cost. Though I don't necessarily agree with Keith Taylor (a rather well known revisionist scholar), the US were indeed winning every strategic defense within Vietnam. One could argue that Operation Rolling Thunder actually *achieved* its goals, which was to destroy the infrastructure and production capacity of North Vietnam.\n\nThe problem however was that the US could never invade North Vietnam from 1961-1969 mainly due to the direct backing and stance of China which officially made clear that China would not turn away from a provocation. In other words, invading past the agreed parallel in the Geneva Accords would have essentially resulted in WWIII. Likewise, most of the Aid sent to North Vietnam was by China until the late 60s. Much of the aid came in the form of munitions, anti-aircraft crews, engineers, road-builders, and vehicles. The majority of that equipment thanks to the rather pragmatic dealings of the North Vietnamese at the time came from China despite both China and the Soviet Union post Sino-Soviet Split vying for the attention of the DRV.\n\nThe other problem occurred after the Tet Offensive in 1968. Though the Tet undoubtedly resulted in a loss for the Viet Cong, the United States couldn't offer a counteroffensive for fear of an even larger escalation of the war. Strategically the Tet Offensive and the resulting attempts to reclaim central Vietnam brought to light a slew of rather unpleasant happenings to the American public. Of which included the My Lai Massacre and the general lack of cooperation of the South Vietnamese which had been a continual problem since the Ngo Dinh Diem and after his assassination in 1964.\n\nI would suggest that a good way of trying to understand why the US failed to win the Vietnam War would be to view the US as not the primary actor, but the patron and benefactor of the South Vietnamese. Though Orthodox scholars have a habit of describing the South as corrupt and incompetent for good reason, the opposite spectrum of the Vietnam War scholarship tends to describe the US as limited by both its domestic policy and the military having \"one hand tied behind their back.\"\n\nWhat both schools tend to miss are the political complexities that affected both North and South. Though the North had more stable leadership, despite a centralized government it too faced serious issues especially during the planning of the Tet Offensive. Likewise, the spy networks that were set up to infiltrate the North by the CIA were woefully inadequate in comparison to the Soviet trained Northern Spies. Despite all this, the standard of living and quality of life was abundantly better in the South. During the 1954 open border season, more than 2 million North Vietnamese fled to the South causing an enormous refugee crisis. The answer to why the US didn't win can't be answered by merely viewing the military and tactical mistakes. The distinct regionalism combined with international geopolitics only created more obstacles along with the more overt lack of cooperation within the South. In tandem with what seemed to be an unclear goal for victory and a very successful insurgency via the Viet Cong, the US's original thoughts of a Conventional War soon gave way to conflict that required the US to understand not only the regional politics of both sides, but also understand the culture and people of a nation and area of which the US had no idea about.\n\nIn hindsight Vietnamization and the escalation via the bombing of Cambodia by Nixon proved an abject failure. If there was one constant failure that I would point out by the US during the Vietnam War, it would be the paradoxically detached but intense involvement the US had within the RVN's internal politics and military. Confronted with political inertia and a fear of escalation that echoed the Korean War (as well as war fatigue from the American populace which had witnessed nearly 20 years of warfare), politically speaking the Vietnam War by 1973 was no longer viable. Even if the US had decided to stay, the progressive transition towards Vietnamization would not have stemmed the huge hole left by the rapid and alarming reduction of aid towards South Vietnam after 1973.\n\nIn short I would suggest that the US couldn't win because the war wasn't a war for the United States. The goal in the end was unification, and the support of the RVN (Republic of Vietnam) by the United States shouldn't be viewed as a war that the US fought for the US as much as it was an extended and heavily involved aid process for South Vietnam. Combined with a lack of understanding of the intricacies of the war and battlefield that continued to be propagated through the AVRN's high command (who were all US trained), victory became a longer and longer prospect.\n\nPS: I should include a lot more primary sources, but outside of a few key notes from journalists within the South Vietnamese government, North Vietnamese sources are particularly difficult to parse, especially since most of them are in Hanoi or Da Lat and generally in Vietnamese and censored.\n\nSources:\n\n1.

His focus was on domestic policies, this is shown by his \"war on poverty\", and the Civil Rights Movement during his presidency. This most certainly had effects on decision making in the Vietnam War. Also to be honest, they thought they were winning. Ia Drang in 1965 was a U.S. victory, Khe Sanh in 1968, was another U.S \"claimed\" victory. Of course they did change their strategy towards Nixon's presidency. Some of his plans were to increase the bombings of Vietnam, essentially a more aggressive bombing campaign than Operation Rolling Thunder. Nixon's bombing plan was called Operation Linebacker. This also included the strategy of Vietnamization. You may have heard the more recent use of this in the Iraq War. Basically the plan was to enact an exit strategy for the war, which was not done prior to involvement, and was later addressed in the Weinberger Doctrine, and later the Powell Doctrine. What Vietnamization's purpose was to reduce American troops in the region, but train the South Vietnamese army to continue the fight, and prevent the domino effect from occurring. Of course, what ended up happening was that South Vietnam fell to the communist forces in 1975. By the time Nixon made changes in the war, it was far too late, and the public had already had enough, which had much to do with the Tet Offensive, My Lai Massacre, and the new journalist approach to events. ", "id": "d4cedli"}, {"comment": "It's hard to assess the efficacy of Nixon's policy. Linebacker most definitely adhered to the \"Mad Man\" policy that he was attempting to convey, but Linebacker's side effects were massive. In driving out VC westward to Cambodia, Linebacker essentially catalyzed and accelerated the rise of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. \n\nFurthermore Vietnamization and the gradual pullout (which became rather rapid) only created a hole as the South Vietnamese economy had to re-adjust to the massive hole left by the withdrawing of American Aid. Perhaps I'm being critical of Nixon but even Operation End Sweep, the mining of Haiphong harbor did little to accelerate the War effort. Ultimately the US just simply couldn't invade North Vietnam short of starting a massive global war. Though Nixon attempted to coerce the North Vietnamese into a peace accord (which was a victory for the US, albeit a loss for the RVN) he did so at an incredibly huge cost.\n\nAlso note that Johnson's cabinet did most of the decisions within the Vietnam War. I would argue that the US high command under Westmoreland and McNamara did more to affect the status of the Vietnam War than Johnson did. If anything, blame could be pointed at Kennedy as those were members of the Kennedy cabinet. Though neither of these considerations give enough of a nuanced look into US policy that affected Vietnam.", "id": "d4cf3kz"}, {"comment": "I would suggest that the US's logistical problems were less due to Vietnamese infrastructure and more due to the sheer distance of the Pacific ocean.\n\nIn fact the North had suffered far more from Operation Rolling Thunder than the South did. Considering that most of the factories and roads were obliterated (though soon repaired) by the continually escalating bombing campaign, the South had comparatively little damage done until the final year of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe largest consideration though is probably China. An escalation after China's open declaration of not avoiding a fight in 1965 would have spelled open war, something that no one within the US was prepared to commit to.\n\nFighting the North Vietnamese directly would have resulted in an all out war between China and the US, hence the defensive stance and the staunch US stance of keeping soldiers below the 17th Parallel.\n\nThere were of course a few failures, the failed Strategic Hamlet program which lasted until the death of Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 did little to encourage the rural populace to help the South Vietnamese. Likewise many counter insurgency attempts failed due to a combination of misunderstandings between the South Vietnamese and the US as well as internal conflicts from the intelligence apparati that split after the assassination of Diem.\n\nI would also add that it wasn't impossible to destroy North Vietamese supplies as much as it was impossible to root out every instance of the NLF/Viet Cong. The US did not even after almost 20 years understand the cultural differences within Vietnam, though difficult, the lack of understanding did little to engender goodwill or assistance from rural populaces. Counterinsurgency failed in a war where full on conventional warfare did little considering the fear of escalation.", "id": "d4cec1p"}]]], "4p9l6h": ["What was the ancient world like in pre Roman republic days??", "2016-06-22 12:08:34", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4p9l6h/what_was_the_ancient_world_like_in_pre_roman/", [[1, "Alright can you first give a concrete year to work from?"], [0, "That completely depends on time and region.

In fact, when I first began this book I was beset by the fear that I would inadvertently enhance the ir credibility by responding to their fantasies. But having immersed myself in their activities for too long a time, I am now convinced that ignoring them is no longer an option. The time to hope that of their own accord they will blow away like the dust is gone. Too many of my students have come to me and asked, \"How do we know there really were gas chambers?\" \"Was the Diary of Anne Frank a hoax?\" \"Are there actual documents attesting to a Nazi plan to annihilate the Jews?\" Some of these students are aware that their questions have been informed by deniers. Others are not; they just know that they have heard these charges and are troubled by them.\n>\n> Not ignoring the deniers does not mean engaging them in discussion or debate. In fact, it means not doing that. We cannot debate them for two reasons, one strategic and the other tactical. As we have repeatedly seen, the deniers long to be considered the \"other\" side. Engaging them in discussion makes them exactly that. Second, they are contemptuous of the very tools that shape any honest debate: truth and reason. Debating them would be like trying to nail a glob of jelly to the wall.\n>\n> Though we cannot directly engage them, there is something we can do. Those who care not just about Jewish history or the history of the Holocaust but about truth in all its forms, must function as canaries in the mine once did, to guard against the spread of noxious fumes. We must vigilantly stand watch against an increasingly nimble enemy. But unlike the canary, we must not sit silently by waiting to expire so that others will be warned of the danger. When we witness assaults on truth, our response must be strong, though neither polemical nor emotional. We must educate the broader public and academe about this threat and its historical and ideological roots. We must expose these people for what they are.\n\nWhat it in the end comes down to is that we do not want to engage with outright Holocaust denial in this space we curate for the same reasons, we have a rule against political soapboxing: It isn't conductive to discussion and does not serve an educational purpose for giving them a forum to spread outright lies with a political agenda is not what we do here.\n\nWe are of course making sure that questions coming from a place of confusion or questions about Holo9caust deniers and their arguments do get answers. I have done so myself in the past for example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4uktlj/were_the_nuremberg_trials_conducted_unfairly/) where I addressed various claims made by the well-known Holocaust Denial organization, the Institute for Historical Review, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4gmxqm/why_the_count_six_million_still_persists_when_the/) where I address claims frequently brought up by deniers about the death count of the Holocaust, or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4qwdyb/why_do_we_not_hear_about_the_6000000_jews_who/d4wgkph) where I go into the 6 million in Russia thing some deniers also use.\n\nFrom reading and addressing all these things, I have learnt another thing about deniers and their way to argue: The discussion will naver take place from the same basic assumptions because deniers care not about truth. They pick small details, take them out of context and then and when you explain it to them, they will flat out deny that the evidence presented has any value or find something else to latch on. As Lipstadt says: \"Debating them would be like trying to nail a glob of jelly to the wall.\"\n\nEvery question here that gets answers about the Holocaust is enganging with deniers on some level because we get the information necessary out there. But to give them a forum here to be debated when their world-view is a construct of lies with a nefarious political agenda is not something we do or want here."], [5, "That there is overwhelming evidence, but people still deny the holocaust, is proof that those people have no foundation in reason.

As this question pertains to basic, underlying facts of the Holocaust, I hope you can appreciate that it can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we want people to get the answers they are looking for, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of response. As such, this message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as Holocaust Denial, and provide a short list of introductory reading. There is always more than can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\n\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\n\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\n\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\n\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was a vast complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\n\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.\n\n##Further Reading\n\n* \"[Third Reich Trilogy](https://books.google.com/books?id=HZmXOPGTGjIC)\" by Richard Evans\n* \"[Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7FiPwAACAAJ)\" by Ian Kershaw\n* \"[Auschwitz: A New History](https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-dZEV228QC)\" by Laurence Rees\n* \"[Ordinary Men](https://books.google.com/books?id=HFB-dkuZzSwC)\" by Christopher Browning\n* \"[Denying History](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-0B9-D5Vz4C)\" by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman\n* [AskHistorians FAQ](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/wwii#wiki_nazi_germany)\n", "id": "d7545sp"}, {"comment": "It still doesn't refute the physical evidence they provide.

You cannot rely on testimonies, and documents alone as evidence.\"\n\nYou are quite literally saying that you cannot rely on evidence as evidence. Testimonies and the staggeringly large, well recorded and deeply analysed paper-trail of the Holocaust are *most certainly* evidence.\n\n> \"One question I always wonder, why wasn't Zyklon B found inside the Auschwitz gas chambers?\"\n\nYou may find this essay, *[Chemistry is not the Science](https://sites.google.com/site/thedenyinghistoryproject/chemistry-is-not-the-science)* by Jamie McCarthy and Richard Green to be of interest to you. It debunks, in painstaking detail, the myths pedaled by Holocaust deniers surrounding Auschwitz and the gas chamber system - including the differences between the chemistry, composition and construction between gas chambers and delousing chambers.\n\nThese are myths which *have* been debunked again and again. As I have discussed in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3m5wjn/eli5_holocaust_denial/) essay on Holocaust Denial, the heart of the problem does not rest on the facts of the Holocaust - which have, to any well informed, rational person, been established beyond a shadow of a doubt. The problem is a twofold question of what to do with deniers themselves, and what to do with the less-maligned audience of their theatrics who, through ignorance, can be led to believe the garbage they pedal. For deniers, there is little we can do. We can avoid giving them a platform, as doing so arguably merely legitimises their lunacy. We can create and support de-radicalisation programs, as many countries currently have. We can engage them in public debate and destroy their arguments piece by piece, as happened most famously between Holocaust denier David Irving and historian Deborah Lipstadt. If we choose this latest part, it is not for the sake of trying to convince deniers - it is for the sake of trying to educate the audience such a spectacle attracts.\n\nThis leads us to the question of the audience, wherein we have a second problem: More people spend their time on /pol/ than on academic forums. It's easier to look at a fabricated meme about the Holocaust than it is to provide a extensive, cited debunking of said meme. As the saying goes, a lie can make it half way around the world before the truth has its boots on. [This](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) website documents an enormous list of primary evidence relevant to the Auschwitz Birkenau gas chambers. Entire libraries of academic discussion exist surrounding the unfathomably large amounts of evidence for the existence of the Holocaust. But random Joe on the Internet doesn't bother to go to his library and read these books, nor does he know where to start on a list like the above. On the other hand, a half-page meme about \"hey look, all these newspaper articles from before the 1940s also mention \"six million Jews,\" ain't that suspicious!\" is easy, digestable, and appeals to the gullible and to those with bigoted inclinations. This is where the question of engagement with Holocaust deniers becomes problematic - yes, we can engage and destroy their arguments for the sake of onlookers, as has been done countless times. But we can't do it to each and every single one. With the proliferation of soapboxes and radicalising influences in social media (prominent examples being a number of other subreddits including, unfortunately, /r/Holocaust, or sites such as 4chan - most prominently /pol/), the ability of Holocaust deniers and other extremists to simply bury reasonable arguments in a wave of bigoted shitposts is extensive. \n\nThey're as aware of this as we are - a classic Holocaust Denier dogwhistle is \"The truth fears no inquiry!\" in response to post removal, censorship or banning - indeed, it's not that the truth hasn't been inquired into. It has been, countless times, in countless formats, in an incredible body of scholarship. But what they want isn't the reasoned, cited, scholastic discussion that /r/AskHistorians provides - they want to be able to bury the front page of poorly moderated subreddits in JAQing, fabricated conspiracies, and antisemitic drivel. And since it takes far less effort to do this than it does to debunk it, we're most certainly not prepared to give them a platform for such activities. \n\nWe *do,* however, take the time on occasion to engage with JAQing - not for the good of the JAQer, but for the sake of the audience. Because when you're a casual reader, the explanation I'm laying out now isn't necessarily apparent, and you may well spend more time being confronted with drivel from the depths of /pol/ than you spend engaging with evidence based discussion.\n\nI do hope this helps clarify both wider questions concerning Holocaust Denial, both here on /r/AskHistorians and in the online sphere.\n\n- Multiple edits for expansion. ", "id": "d754t00"}, {"comment": "I'll just add to this the canned Macro for /r/history which explains why Denialism is banned there. It fits well enough here too:\n\n> On /r/History, Holocaust Denial is banned for several reasons. At its most basic, we don't allow it because it is simply not history, but an attempt to negate history. Plenty of real controversy and debate surrounds Holocaust Studies - such as the Intentionalist v. Functionalist debate - but those who advocate that the Holocaust never happened, or else deny some of the basic underlying facts such as the use of gas chambers, do *not* bring useful or productive discussion to the table. In practical terms, it is little different than a Flat-Earther or Moon-landing Hoaxer attempting to hijack a thread in /r/science or /r/space. Even in the best of circumstances, their presence in a discussion will result in a thread going far off-kilter as it becomes the dominating topic.\n\n> However, we are not blind to the fact that in quashing posts which advocate Holocaust denial, we risk feeding them ammunition as they in-turn complain that we are \"suppressing the truth\". And similarly, this being reddit, plenty of users who might not actually be Holocaust deniers nevertheless ask us why we don't \"let the upvotes and downvotes decide\" or \"let the truth speak for itself\" or ~~\"go fuck yourselves you Fascist shits\"~~. We'll spare the discussion of what \"Free Speech\" means, or proper understanding of the limits of the First Amendment for another day, and instead concentrate on more practical concerns. \n\n> In an ideal world, every time a piece of Holocaust denial was posted in /r/History, a dozen learned scholars would immediately pounce and tear their \"argument\" apart point by point. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen. A lot of their \"arguments\" are constructed in a way that they seem very plausible, which means that often it indeed takes someone with above average knowledge about this particular subject to debunk them. With a userbase as large as ours this also means that we can't reasonably expect everyone to have that knowledge yet. Which in return means that sadly we too often see that it takes a while before Holocaust denial does receive the pushback it deserves, at which point the damage already has been done and the false information has been seeded into the minds of people less knowledgeable about the subject.\n\n> Even worse, often enough we see it getting upvoted as well before receiving any pushback, giving it an even greater impression of legitimacy,  which in turn means that they get even more exposure. These upvotes originate from a variety of sources; outside brigades trying to push the subject,  the earlier mentioned ignorance on a subject and reasons we don't understand ourselves (on a userbase of millions you will always have the group of people that for some reason seem to look for the contrarian view no matter if it is true or not).\n   \n> So while we would perhaps prefer to see claims quickly and definitely countered, the mod team, which is made up of volunteers, simply don't have the time to do that for every such comment, nor can we reasonably expect that the wider userbase would be able to counter each one either. So in light of that, we would much prefer to see those comments simply removed rather than risk them stand uncontested. \n\n> Is that the right call in the big scheme of things? Who knows. But we do firmly believe that given the limited resources available to us, and our stated mission of keeping /r/history a place for real historical discussion, there is no reasonable alternative to deal with it.", "id": "d758bbu"}], [{"comment": "We have discussed this various times in various threads and /u/elm11 has already given a variety of reasons, why we remove posts by Holocaust deniers.

When we witness assaults on truth, our response must be strong, though neither polemical nor emotional. We must educate the broader public and academe about this threat and its historical and ideological roots. We must expose these people for what they are.\n\nWhat it in the end comes down to is that we do not want to engage with outright Holocaust denial in this space we curate for the same reasons, we have a rule against political soapboxing: It isn't conductive to discussion and does not serve an educational purpose for giving them a forum to spread outright lies with a political agenda is not what we do here.\n\nWe are of course making sure that questions coming from a place of confusion or questions about Holo9caust deniers and their arguments do get answers. I have done so myself in the past for example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4uktlj/were_the_nuremberg_trials_conducted_unfairly/) where I addressed various claims made by the well-known Holocaust Denial organization, the Institute for Historical Review, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4gmxqm/why_the_count_six_million_still_persists_when_the/) where I address claims frequently brought up by deniers about the death count of the Holocaust, or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4qwdyb/why_do_we_not_hear_about_the_6000000_jews_who/d4wgkph) where I go into the 6 million in Russia thing some deniers also use.\n\nFrom reading and addressing all these things, I have learnt another thing about deniers and their way to argue: The discussion will naver take place from the same basic assumptions because deniers care not about truth. They pick small details, take them out of context and then and when you explain it to them, they will flat out deny that the evidence presented has any value or find something else to latch on.

The Pacific theatre and North African Campaign are overlooked theaters of war because of the lack of cultural significance to many westerners but some of the fighting done in the Pacific by Americans was vital to the ending of conflict with Japan such as Midway and Battle of Coral Sea.  There really was no other naval superpower capable of taking down Japan at the time.  Germany's u-boats were not meant to county true imperialistic naval superpowers like USA or Japan but stifle the flow of men and supplies. \n\nNo one disputes that the bulk of the land war was fought by Chinese and Russians but such is Asian warfare during a world war.  But while volume of fighters and casualties may have been outcome determinative in Asia, the European theatre greatly benefited from the press of UK, France, and USA to ensure the cold war era had a balance of powers.  Otherwise, a super hegemony of Russia and China would have surely paved the way for ultimate socialization and economic ruin for centuries to come.  America's standpoint as the political victor of WWII is exaggerated but one that mankind can thank them for seeing as the fall of communism was imminent.  The political and social upheaval that would have come out of a fully USSR controlled Europe can't be even fathomed although it would be like imagining everything East of Spain being equivalent to the livelihood of an eastern european country.  That is hindsight though.  Socialism is a great political ideology.  I've lived in Cuba for a bit and absolutely love the lifestyle and camaraderie of genuine communists.  But sadly, the post WWII cadre of communists out of USSR and China did nothing but atrocities to their own people and one could say for lack of genuine embracement of true communist principles--mainly for fear of losing their own personal power and being a dominant hegemony.  I'm not saying the cold war was good but the exaggerated political victory by the Americans is not so exaggerated if you see WWII as a firm starting point for the rest of the 20th century.  Although many atrocities were committed in the name of Mcarthyism or anti-communism by the USA, the ending point of the USA in WWII can be said to greatly increase the livelihood of westerners for the most part.  Westerners also create most of the media and drive the focus of academic discussion sometimes and therefore the US, UK, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and French involvement in WWII is paramount in media and academia for its interest to economically affluent audiences.  Although you're perception of this exaggeration itself shows your susceptibility to it as a consumer of western media.

The Pacific theatre and North African Campaign are overlooked theaters of war because of the lack of cultural significance to many westerners but some of the fighting done in the Pacific by Americans was vital to the ending of conflict with Japan such as Midway and Battle of Coral Sea.  There really was no other naval superpower capable of taking down Japan at the time.  Germany's u-boats were not meant to county true imperialistic naval superpowers like USA or Japan but stifle the flow of men and supplies. \n\nNo one disputes that the bulk of the land war was fought by Chinese and Russians but such is Asian warfare during a world war.  But while volume of fighters and casualties may have been outcome determinative in Asia, the European theatre greatly benefited from the press of UK, France, and USA to ensure the cold war era had a balance of powers.  Otherwise, a super hegemony of Russia and China would have surely paved the way for ultimate socialization and economic ruin for centuries to come.  America's standpoint as the political victor of WWII is exaggerated but one that mankind can thank them for seeing as the fall of communism was imminent.  The political and social upheaval that would have come out of a fully USSR controlled Europe can't be even fathomed although it would be like imagining everything East of Spain being equivalent to the livelihood of an eastern european country.  That is hindsight though.  Socialism is a great political ideology.  I've lived in Cuba for a bit and absolutely love the lifestyle and camaraderie of genuine communists.  But sadly, the post WWII cadre of communists out of USSR and China did nothing but atrocities to their own people and one could say for lack of genuine embracement of true communist principles--mainly for fear of losing their own personal power and being a dominant hegemony.  I'm not saying the cold war was good but the exaggerated political victory by the Americans is not so exaggerated if you see WWII as a firm starting point for the rest of the 20th century.  Although many atrocities were committed in the name of Mcarthyism or anti-communism by the USA, the ending point of the USA in WWII can be said to greatly increase the livelihood of westerners for the most part.  Westerners also create most of the media and drive the focus of academic discussion sometimes and therefore the US, UK, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and French involvement in WWII is paramount in media and academia for its interest to economically affluent audiences.  Although you're perception of this exaggeration itself shows your susceptibility to it as a consumer of western media.  Many great works have been written in Chinese and Russian on their achievements of the land battle in Asia but unless those cultures dominate the minds of westerns, they will not dominate the media.  \n\nEDIT: check out these awesome Russian aviator women. \n\nhttp://www.seizethesky.com/nwitches/nitewtch.html", "id": "d2k173k"}], [{"comment": "The US was crucial to the development and ending of WWII.

These periods, while calibrated by forms of dating, are largely used to denote periods of cultural development and change rather than a level of technology. Within Mesoamerica you find five major periods, each with their own beginning and end as well as their own subdivisions based on where you are within Mesoamerica. They are the paleoindian, Archaic, Formative/Preclassic, Classic, and then Postclassic. The For example, the Archaic period was a time in which a lot of plants underwent domestication. And the Formative/Preclassic was a time when more complex societies were emerging. To illustrate the differences in beginnings and ending, within West Mexico the Classic period ends around 550 AD. It is followed by the Epiclassic, a period of upheaval and drastic change, and then the Postclassic. Within the Maya area, however, the Classic period ends around 900/1000 AD and is immediately followed by the Postclassic without an interim period because the Maya region does not need one.\n\nBecause these are chronological periods based on cultural development and change, to try and fit Mesoamericans or even Native Americans as a whole into a system used within Europe just doesn't work or fit. It's two different systems denoting two different ways of dividing up history. And as /u/Reedstilt points out in their post, stone age and copper/bronze age are meaningless within the Americas because despite not having widespread use, metal working had been going on since at least 4000 BC.\n\n(And thank you for listening to my podcast episode)", "id": "cz1vbvr"}, {"comment": "Super thanks! \n\nSince we're on this topic, can you explain for West Mexico the characteristics of each age?

Most of my studies have been on Jalisco and on the shaft tomb culture so this sketch of a chronology will be heavily focused around that. Apologies\n\nPaleoindian period\n\nAll I can really tell you is that it happened. I'm not aware of a lot of discoveries or work done on this period. It might have to do with Jalisco being in a very geologically active area so things that are as old as the paleoindian period are difficult to find. The one bit about the paleoindian period I know of is that Folsom points made their way as far south as Jalisco because one such point had been found by the people of Los Guachimontones (Late Formative/Classic period) and [deposited within an offering cache](https://www.academia.edu/235104/Folsom_Points_from_Los_Guachimontones_Site_Jalisco_Mexico). \n\nThe Archaic\n\nIt's just as mysterious as the paleoindian period within Jalisco. Again, not a lot of preservation or people are just not finding things that date to this period. The Las Balsas area, which is sometimes included within West Mexico, has the earliest evidence of maize domestication, however. [Beekman](https://www.academia.edu/5000256/Continuities_from_Archaic_through_Formative_Ritualized_Claims_on_the_Landscape) has discussed Archaic period claims to the landscape based on some burials that have been found.\n\nThe Early Formative (~1500 BC to 800 BC)\n\nThe Early Formative is when we really begin to see complex societies on the landscape within West Mexico. In coastal Nayarit there is the Matanchen complex centered around the mangrove swamps of the coast. Nestled in one such swamp is a giant pyramidal mound made up of unopened shells called El Calon. The mound measures 80m by 100m and rises 25m and from the top offers an impressive view of the entire swamp area.\n\nAround the town of Capacha in Colima, Isabel Kelly identified ceramics that also date to the Early Formative. These ceramics were later found up and down the Pacific coast and even made their way into the interior. [Some researchers](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l9zzmmdav574o3b/West%20Mexico%20distillation.pdf?dl=0) made replicas of the Capacha culture's unique stirrup vessels and performed an experiment and found that it was possible to distill liquor from agave mash with upwards of 20+% alcohol by volume. As to whether or not the Capacha culture actually did this needs to be investigated. No center or settlement has yet to be identified for Capacha as far as I am aware. The ceramics have all been recovered from burials.\n\nAnd then within Michoacan is the first shaft tomb cemetery at a site called El Ope\u00f1o. It had its own locally made ceramics and ceramic figures as well as imported ceramics from the coastal Capacha culture and imported pieces of jade from elsewhere in Mesoamerica. Instead of having straight vertical shafts with chambers at the bottom, the El Ope\u00f1o are characterized by having short shafts leading to a staircase and then a chamber.\n\nThe Middle Formative (800 BC to 300 BC)\n\nThe Middle Formative is another poorly understood period within Jalisco and we\u2019re really not sure why. We know that in places like [Mascota]( http://www.famsi.org/reports/03009/03009Mountjoy01.pdf) that there is a continuation of the shaft tomb culture and even some Capacha-like ceramics casting doubt as to when the Capacha culture actually flourished. Phil Weigand claims to have mapped and investigated looted tombs from the Tequila Valleys that date to the Middle Formative, but I have yet to see any ceramic fragments he recovered or photos he may have taken. Weigand also said he recorded three mounds in the region which had burials and ceramics. One of these mounds was destroyed by a roadwork crew as they built a highway, but I don\u2019t know why the site wasn\u2019t formally recovered by a salvage operation. And that\u2019s really about it. It is a period that I and Chris Beekman are both interested in, but for our own reasons. He\u2019s interested in the development of society inequality for the shaft tomb culture, I\u2019m interested in the development of the later ceremonial architecture and whether or not there is a Middle Formative precursor. Both of us, I think, would benefit from excavating one of those Middle Formative mounds.\n\nThe Late Formative (300 BC to 200 AD) to Classic period (200 AD to 550 AD)\n\nThis the period, along with the Classic, in which you find the height of the shaft tomb culture. The STC, for short, is found not only in Jalisco, but Nayarit, Colima, and southern Zacatecas as well. This is the period in which you find the [hollow and solid shaft tomb figures, ceramic dioramas and models]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/search?q=shaft+tomb+culture&restrict_sr=on), and circular temple groups called a [guachimonton]( http://i.imgur.com/d69q8K8.jpg) (after the site of Los Guachimontones). We\u2019re still very much learning about this period of history, but at least we have sites and material culture to draw from unlike other periods like the archaic. The leading hypothesis about the political system of the STC is that they were a [corporate group]( https://www.academia.edu/400451/Corporate_Power_Strategies_In_the_Late_Formative_to_Early_Classic_Tequila_Valleys_of_Central_Jalisco). Rather than having a single ruler or leader there was a group of rulers or leaders that were most likely based upon family/lineage/clan membership. This fits within the type of ceremonial structure they used with multiple platforms that are attributed to different groups. My thesis is actually testing this model by using architectural energetics to find if there are statistically significant difference in the amount of the labor needed between any and all of the platforms that are attributed to these ruling groups.\nI would like to point out, mostly to annoy /u/Cozijo, is that the shaft tomb at Huitzilapa has the oldest paper in all of Mesoamerica and it dates to 76 AD.\n\nThe Epiclassic (550 AD to 900 AD)\n\nAs mentioned, the Epiclassic is a period of turmoil and change. Within Jalisco almost everything changes. And I mean almost everything. From the ceremonial architecture all the way down to lithic tool types. There is almost no cultural continuation between the periods. The only thing I am aware of that continued was the use and expansion of pseudo-cloisonne technology. In the Classic period it was used to decorate shell and some ceramics with simple designs, in the Epiclassic you had complex codex-like scenes put on vessels. This technique is also found outside of Jalisco with great pieces found at Alta Vista and La Quemada in Zacatecas. [Beekman]( https://www.academia.edu/5000272/Disruption_Before_and_Behind_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Migration_in_Epiclassic_Northern_Mesoamerica) believes that the Epiclassic was a period in which Jalisco came under the influence of outside migrant groups fleeing more drought-stricken areas. Jalisco experienced drought, but it seems to have fared better than other places like the Bajio. It is a rather interesting period and one that I have considered focusing on in future work.\n\nThe Postclassic (900 AD to Contact)\n\nThis is a period in which the changes of the Epiclassic have solidified. A lot of Jalisco is now in a state of competing multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic groups like the Texuexe, Coca, Caxcan, and naguatos (what the Spaniards called Nahuatl speakers) and other groups. At some point the Tarascans tried to attack and conquer the region and got as far as Lake Chapala before they were turned away or had to retreat to maintain supply lines. /u/Ucumu could probably expand more on that because I\u2019m not very informed on this period.\n\nBoth the Epiclassic and the Postclassic saw the introduction of more identifiable deities such as the feathered serpent, fire serpent, and Tlaloc. It isn\u2019t that the STC didn\u2019t have deities, they just appear to have deities we have yet to be able to identify. However, that may be due to a lack of a good symbolic analysis of the material. One of the new ethnic groups in the region, the Caxcanes, apparently worshiped Huitzilopochtli and at times Huitzilopochtli commanded them to attack their neighbors.\n\nAnd that is a short run down on the area.\n\nI do encourage anyone who is interested to read Beekman's lengthy [Recent Research](https://www.academia.edu/400453/Recent_Research_In_Western_Mexican_Archaeology) article on West Mexico.", "id": "cz1xraz"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the rundown!\n\n> a giant pyramidal mound made up of unopened shells called El Calon\n\nThis is very interesting.

Popular idea of communism was very simple: money will not be an issue anymore, because there will be no money, so you are trying to do your best at work and you can have all you want (\"\u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u2014 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\" \u2014 From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs).

Popular idea of communism was very simple: money will not be an issue anymore, because there will be no money, so you are trying to do your best at work and you can have all you want (\"\u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c, \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u2014 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\" \u2014 From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs). It sounds much better than socialist motto \u2014 \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his work\" \u2014 that was written into soviet constitution.\n\nSo, communism was never put in place in this country. Were the proletarians content with socialism? If we are talking about 1970-1980 then mostly yes, because soviet system has some cookies (schools are free, medicine is free, flats are free), because West is scary, and because there was no real reference point (the revolution has happened several generations earlier, so when you are discussing now and then with your father or grandfather you are comparing socialism now with 20/40-years-ago-socialism, not with Russian empire). And Soviet Union in 1980 is much, much more rich and safe than Soviet Union in 1940.\n\nIf your question was about the Russian revolution and short period of war communism, the historians will answer much better than me, but I want to mention that there was a Civil war just after the revolution, and war communism experiment was cancelled by soviet government, because it failed.", "id": "cz0xmw7"}], [{"comment": "You have to remember that both Stalinist dictatorship and Northern European Social Democracy are both modified forms of Marxism. When Marx was writing and when communist regimes took power, no one knew how things were going to turn out.\n\nMarx was writing in a time when there were massive numbers of people moving from agricultural and artisan lives to factory work that was dangerous, lowly paid and completely insecure. In general across Europe and the US there was no minimum wage, food stamps or unemployment benefits and brutal, uncompensated industrial accidents were common.\n\nMarx and other socialists became popular because they acknowledged and sought to address these issues. Marxist parties in western Europe have arguably been very successful in raising the living standards of these countries.\n\nBoth China and Russia were run by brutal monarchist/nationalist dictatorships before brutal communist dictatorships took over. While there was resistance to communist regimes, it wasn't like these countries were democratic, prosperous places before Stalin and Mao which made people there more likely to accept conditions. Anyways, when it came to women's rights, meritocracy and general social organization, the communist regimes were almost certainly an improvement over their predecessors, especially at first.\n\nAlso by the time things got really bad in the Soviet Union and Red China, not only were many people \"brainwashed\" but dissent was cracked down on so hard that most people just kept their mouths shut.", "id": "cz0s5b5"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cz0og7q"}]]], "55hpbr": ["Was Marilyn Monroe involved with Robert Kennedy after all?", "2016-10-02 14:19:53", 2, "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/55hpbr/was_marilyn_monroe_involved_with_robert_kennedy/", [], []], "4t8car": ["META Cane we get a \"Graveyard\" tag for posts where every single comment has been removed?", "2016-07-17 09:22:24", 5, "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4t8car/meta_cane_we_get_a_graveyard_tag_for_posts_where/", [[1, "No."], [3, "Hi, you may be interested in participating in this thread, which is still active on our front page \n\n* [Can we get an \"Unanswered\" tag?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4t301h/can_we_get_an_unanswered_tag/)"]], [[{"comment": "No.", "id": "d5fd2pk"}], [{"comment": "Hi, you may be interested in participating in this thread, which is still active on our front page \n\n* [Can we get an \"Unanswered\" tag?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4t301h/can_we_get_an_unanswered_tag/)", "id": "d5fcxsf"}]]], "497ygu": ["How long do humans as we know them exist", "2016-03-06 19:25:08", 2, "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/497ygu/how_long_do_humans_as_we_know_them_exist/", [[5, ">Is there a definitive answer?\n\nNo, there are no definitive answers yet.\n\nOur species goes back at most 200,000 years, so any \"300,000\" year dates you've read don't refer to our species.

Actually, abortion is a bit complicated: Christians have been essentially always opposed to abortion after \"ensoulment\" is said to occur. But Thomas Aquinas was also against abortion of unsouled fetuses, though he didn't regard it has homicide. Since the 1800s most Christians have believed that ensoulment takes place at conception. Generally though the official beliefs of traditional Christians haven't really changed much. \n\nIt's really that Western cultures have rejected many Christian theological, moral, and political teachings they used to accept in favor of philosophies rooted in the Enlightenment. (To see this, read Jeremy Bentham, an Enlightenment philosopher from the early 1800s. Most of his ideas are now central to Western culture and politics.) This process has involved social tension, revolutions, and wars. On the one hand, atheists, freethinkers, and gays (eg Oscar Wilde, Alan Turing) were persecuted by Christians in power. On the other hand, when the revolutionaries succeeded, they persecuted Christians (eg Vendee massacres during French Revolution). The issues you mentioned are areas where disagreement is the strongest, and so these issues are now emphasized by both sides.\n\nIn other words, we've witnessed a power struggle in the West. It's just that in France the struggle took place around the time of the French Revolution. In Germany the Kulturkampf (German for culture struggle) was fought in the latter half of the 19th century. In European countries with established Protestant churches (eg England), there wasn't much conflict, because the clergy actually were generally for the shift. But in America the culture war is not quite finished, due to the presence of the Catholic Church and non-mainline Protestant (aka evangelical) churches. (The mainline Protestant churches in America are sister churches of the establishment Protestant churches in Europe, and have supported the cultural shift from traditional Christianity towards Enlightenment values.) Also, unlike Europe, the American culture war has been waged more peacefully among \"hearts and minds\" especially via the media and in educational institutions. \n\nIf you follow progressive news sources (eg Huffington Post), you'll constantly be hearing about various offensive comments by conservative Christian Republican politicians or Catholic child sex abuse. You'll also hear about mostly secular young heroes from Teach for America or the Peace Corps. If you read evangelical or Catholic news sources (eg World Magazine or Crux Magazine), you'll constantly be reading stories about Christian charity work in America and abroad, the plight of refugees and immigrants, or celebratory profiles of gay Christians who attempt to be celibate. You'll also hear about child sex abuse in public schools (actually about as prevalent as that in Catholic church). In other words, there's a low-grade propaganda war going on in America."], [20, "[removed]"], [5, "I disagree with the premise of the question - that is to say, I think incorrectly attributes certain qualities upon a group that said group would reject. \n\nRegardless of how one views these issues politically, I think we can all agree that American Christians do not perceive themselves to be anti-this or anti-that. The anti-abortion, anti-everything not penile-to-vaginal sexual intercourse between married adults, and other views are, from the perspective of believing Christians very much *positive* views. They would called it pro-life, with the life in question being that of the fetus, which Christians believe begins at conception. As for the sex stuff, it would be viewed as pro-morality, where public morality and virtue is a major component of public health more generally. \n\nRegardless of whether we, personally and politically, *believe* that we might understand the *true motives* of the other side (e.g. many progressives would argue that the anti-abortion and anti-sex stuff is more about controlling women's bodies, even if those Christian voters deny this), we must, in a forum like AskHistorians, at least attempt to come at the question in a neutral way, and part of that, I would argue, means taking the claims of each sides at least at face value, even if we disagree with those claims or their implications. \n\nAs for the specifics of his question - why s/he never hears about the \"nicer\" parts and only about the \"anti-\" parts, I, like /u/aflexiblechain submit that OP is suffering from selection bias.

Actually, abortion is a bit complicated: Christians have been essentially always opposed to abortion after \"ensoulment\" is said to occur. But Thomas Aquinas was also against abortion of unsouled fetuses, though he didn't regard it has homicide. Since the 1800s most Christians have believed that ensoulment takes place at conception. Generally though the official beliefs of traditional Christians haven't really changed much. \n\nIt's really that Western cultures have rejected many Christian theological, moral, and political teachings they used to accept in favor of philosophies rooted in the Enlightenment. (To see this, read Jeremy Bentham, an Enlightenment philosopher from the early 1800s. Most of his ideas are now central to Western culture and politics.) This process has involved social tension, revolutions, and wars. On the one hand, atheists, freethinkers, and gays (eg Oscar Wilde, Alan Turing) were persecuted by Christians in power. On the other hand, when the revolutionaries succeeded, they persecuted Christians (eg Vendee massacres during French Revolution). The issues you mentioned are areas where disagreement is the strongest, and so these issues are now emphasized by both sides.\n\nIn other words, we've witnessed a power struggle in the West. It's just that in France the struggle took place around the time of the French Revolution. In Germany the Kulturkampf (German for culture struggle) was fought in the latter half of the 19th century. In European countries with established Protestant churches (eg England), there wasn't much conflict, because the clergy actually were generally for the shift. But in America the culture war is not quite finished, due to the presence of the Catholic Church and non-mainline Protestant (aka evangelical) churches. (The mainline Protestant churches in America are sister churches of the establishment Protestant churches in Europe, and have supported the cultural shift from traditional Christianity towards Enlightenment values.) Also, unlike Europe, the American culture war has been waged more peacefully among \"hearts and minds\" especially via the media and in educational institutions. \n\nIf you follow progressive news sources (eg Huffington Post), you'll constantly be hearing about various offensive comments by conservative Christian Republican politicians or Catholic child sex abuse. You'll also hear about mostly secular young heroes from Teach for America or the Peace Corps. If you read evangelical or Catholic news sources (eg World Magazine or Crux Magazine), you'll constantly be reading stories about Christian charity work in America and abroad, the plight of refugees and immigrants, or celebratory profiles of gay Christians who attempt to be celibate. You'll also hear about child sex abuse in public schools (actually about as prevalent as that in Catholic church).

Yet this was in reaction to religious voters who opposed abortion largely due the influence of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The anti-abortion, anti-everything not penile-to-vaginal sexual intercourse between married adults, and other views are, from the perspective of believing Christians very much *positive* views.

Islam (which I know a thing or two about)\n2. 20th century left wing movements (which I have a well-informed layman's opinion about)\n3. 19th century left wing movements (which I know very little about)\n\nand 4. 19th century left-wing anti-Catholic anti-clericalism (which I know nothing about.)\n\nSo to say the least it would require a broader range of knowledge than I possess to answer the question fully.\n\nThe being said I think I can discuss a few issues that point in the right direction:\n\nAmong 20th century left-wing movements (and I'm avoiding the use of \"radical\" left because then presumably we're talking a violent subset which would require a level of knowledge about, say, the Red Army Faction or the Weather Underground that I simply don't have) one of the defining features of these movements has been anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the Islamic world for much of the 20th century was part of the European imperial system, either directly in the case of Greater India, as a kind of suzerainty in the case of Egypt after it was nominally granted independence in 1922 or as a playing field for Western imperial powers to do as they please (e.g. the occupation of Iran in 1941 and the coup there in 1953.)\n\nSo when you have anti-colonialist movements in the Islamic world, many of which are in fact *not* overtly Islamic or Islamist, these were naturally embraced by the anti-imperialist Western left. The 1956 Suez Crisis I think is a great example of this where Nasser, a secularist leader of an Islamic country was seen by the left as resisting a Western imperialist plot against him. As it turned out, that analysis was exactly correct. But the result was anti-war protests in Britain [looked](https://socialistworker.co.uk/images1412/Image/2016/2486/SUEZ-TO-USE.jpg) a [lot](http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/2658937-rally-in-trafalgar-square-london-in-protest-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&c=IWSAsset&k=2&d=14vLaH0PJ%2B1HvVL%2BCN%2BuY3jk124zHGu7s3nBoCoRdIqJP7XY7lsz0UM4NfJDbizM) like [the kinds](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/ecb56c793d1c44f38bf91e733d6677e7/suez-crisis-1956-a-stage-camel-makes-a-useful-prop-in-a-protest-over-b4t25b.jpg) of left-wing anti-war protests that I think the popular imagine are more commonly associated with the 1960s.\n\nI think shifting perceptions of the left vis a vis Israel are also crucial here. Zionism was, for a time, very much viewed as a left wing cause. The Zionist movement in Palestine prior to and after the declaration of the state of Israel was largely dominated by [Labor Zionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Zionism) who in the form of kibbutzim were promoting the kind of collectivized farming and communal living that was then current with international left-wing movements supportive of various forms of socialism or communism, for example in Castro's Cuba.\n\nIsrael, in the aftermath of the Holocaust was likewise seen as perhaps the greatest example of the national self-determination the world's most oppressed people, perhaps the most oppressed people in world history. So just as the US recognized Israel minutes after it declared independence, the Soviet Union was also incredibly supportive of Zionism and I believe was the first country to de jure recognize Israel a day or two later.\n\nIn varying degrees between 1948 and 1973 that left-wing support for Israel started to change pretty significantly. Firstly, the Middle East itself became just as much a theater of action for the Cold War as any other part of the world and which became closely related to the so-called [Arab Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Cold_War). So that, in the build-up to the Suez Crisis with Nasser recognizing the Chinese communist government, receiving an arms deal via Czechoslovakia, it looked as though Egypt and the Arab nationalist states would be increasingly the preferred bloc of the Soviet Union and the international left while Israel and the Arab monarchies would receive the support of the US and Europe. (NB, this is oversimplifying things, and in particular the US relationship with Israel between 1948 and 1967 is actually really complicated, but in broad strokes this is how it turned out.)\n\nAfter 1967, Israel also starts to look to the left less like the state of an oppressed people and more like a Western-backed oppressor in its own right. Also note that this is less true of the US left, where even if support for Israel ebbs and flows, support for [Arabs was virtually non-existent until the late 1970s.](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/gallup.html)\n\nFollowing the 1967 there are a number of developments that more closely align the Palestinian movement with the left. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is founded in 1967 and Yasser Arafat takes over as chairman of the PLO in 1969.\n\nLikewise in this time period you also have, specific to France, the Algerian revolution, which to my understanding very much became a left-right issue.\n\nBy the time of the 1973 war I think any doubts about the extent to which Israel was going to permanently receive the support of the US were over, and as a result the anti-American left also became a pro-Arab/Palestinian left.

Or Israel's relationship with the apartheid government of South Africa prompting pro-Palestinian solidarity among anti-Apartheid activists who might otherwise not have been involved in the Palestinian issue.

Islam (which I know a thing or two about)\n2. 20th century left wing movements (which I have a well-informed layman's opinion about)\n3. 19th century left wing movements (which I know very little about)\n\nand 4. 19th century left-wing anti-Catholic anti-clericalism (which I know nothing about.)\n\nSo to say the least it would require a broader range of knowledge than I possess to answer the question fully.\n\nThe being said I think I can discuss a few issues that point in the right direction:\n\nAmong 20th century left-wing movements (and I'm avoiding the use of \"radical\" left because then presumably we're talking a violent subset which would require a level of knowledge about, say, the Red Army Faction or the Weather Underground that I simply don't have) one of the defining features of these movements has been anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the Islamic world for much of the 20th century was part of the European imperial system, either directly in the case of Greater India, as a kind of suzerainty in the case of Egypt after it was nominally granted independence in 1922 or as a playing field for Western imperial powers to do as they please (e.g. the occupation of Iran in 1941 and the coup there in 1953.)\n\nSo when you have anti-colonialist movements in the Islamic world, many of which are in fact *not* overtly Islamic or Islamist, these were naturally embraced by the anti-imperialist Western left. The 1956 Suez Crisis I think is a great example of this where Nasser, a secularist leader of an Islamic country was seen by the left as resisting a Western imperialist plot against him. As it turned out, that analysis was exactly correct. But the result was anti-war protests in Britain [looked](https://socialistworker.co.uk/images1412/Image/2016/2486/SUEZ-TO-USE.jpg) a [lot](http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/2658937-rally-in-trafalgar-square-london-in-protest-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&c=IWSAsset&k=2&d=14vLaH0PJ%2B1HvVL%2BCN%2BuY3jk124zHGu7s3nBoCoRdIqJP7XY7lsz0UM4NfJDbizM) like [the kinds](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/ecb56c793d1c44f38bf91e733d6677e7/suez-crisis-1956-a-stage-camel-makes-a-useful-prop-in-a-protest-over-b4t25b.jpg) of left-wing anti-war protests that I think the popular imagine are more commonly associated with the 1960s.\n\nI think shifting perceptions of the left vis a vis Israel are also crucial here. Zionism was, for a time, very much viewed as a left wing cause. The Zionist movement in Palestine prior to and after the declaration of the state of Israel was largely dominated by [Labor Zionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Zionism) who in the form of kibbutzim were promoting the kind of collectivized farming and communal living that was then current with international left-wing movements supportive of various forms of socialism or communism, for example in Castro's Cuba.\n\nIsrael, in the aftermath of the Holocaust was likewise seen as perhaps the greatest example of the national self-determination the world's most oppressed people, perhaps the most oppressed people in world history. So just as the US recognized Israel minutes after it declared independence, the Soviet Union was also incredibly supportive of Zionism and I believe was the first country to de jure recognize Israel a day or two later.\n\nIn varying degrees between 1948 and 1973 that left-wing support for Israel started to change pretty significantly. Firstly, the Middle East itself became just as much a theater of action for the Cold War as any other part of the world and which became closely related to the so-called [Arab Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Cold_War). So that, in the build-up to the Suez Crisis with Nasser recognizing the Chinese communist government, receiving an arms deal via Czechoslovakia, it looked as though Egypt and the Arab nationalist states would be increasingly the preferred bloc of the Soviet Union and the international left while Israel and the Arab monarchies would receive the support of the US and Europe. (NB, this is oversimplifying things, and in particular the US relationship with Israel between 1948 and 1967 is actually really complicated, but in broad strokes this is how it turned out.)\n\nAfter 1967, Israel also starts to look to the left less like the state of an oppressed people and more like a Western-backed oppressor in its own right. Also note that this is less true of the US left, where even if support for Israel ebbs and flows, support for [Arabs was virtually non-existent until the late 1970s.](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/gallup.html)\n\nFollowing the 1967 there are a number of developments that more closely align the Palestinian movement with the left. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is founded in 1967 and Yasser Arafat takes over as chairman of the PLO in 1969.\n\nLikewise in this time period you also have, specific to France, the Algerian revolution, which to my understanding very much became a left-right issue.\n\nBy the time of the 1973 war I think any doubts about the extent to which Israel was going to permanently receive the support of the US were over, and as a result the anti-American left also became a pro-Arab/Palestinian left. This I think you could make the case was reinforced by the premiership of Menachem Begin in 1977, Israel's first Likud (i.e. right wing, non-labor) prime minister.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, by the 1970s you also have the makings of a religious revival in the Islamic world. Secularist Arab nationalists are starting to lose ground to Islamist factions of the Muslim Brotherhood so that even where pan-Arab socialism is still dominant you have leaders like Anwar Sadat making significant concessions to Islamists.\n\nI'm not familiar with what left-wing support for the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran was like but that revolution certainly borrowed much of the language and propaganda elements of the hard left including national liberation and anti-Americanism.

The easiest example of a \"third gender\" is the gender of eunuchs, and where they would have been placed on the one-sex model has been explored by Roger Freitas in [this paper.](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jm.2003.20.2.196) In short, they would have been understood as some sort of subset of the masculine gender, but not fully masculine. [Femminielli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femminiello) may also be of interest to you.

While Hebrew did have words for things that could be dirty words before Modern Hebrew, most of them were used as neutral words for bodily functions/body parts/etc.  Nearly all Modern Hebrew profanities are loaned from other languages, particularly Arabic.  While some are just loaned (such as *kus* or *sharmuta*), some are calques, or direct translations, such as saying kus ima shelkha as a direct translation of Arabic kus emak.  English profanities also are fairly widely used in Modern Hebrew.\n\nThere are a few native Hebrew terms, though.  One is *zona*, which is a classical Hebrew term for prostitute.  Early speakers would've learned that word and started applying it negatively, usually by calling people *ben-zona* (son of a *zona*).  One very productive term is *zayin*, which is the name of the 7th letter of the alphabet.  In classical Hebrew it meant \"sword\", which is used in some languages for a euphemism for the penis.  In Hebrew it's especially fitting, since the letter looks vaguely phallic.  It's used in lots of phrases with regular verbs to express various emotions.  Plus the verb form, lezayen, roughly means \"to fuck\".  There are a few more that are more clearly relatively new euphemisms, such as using *lidfok* (to push, knock, hit) to mean \"to screw\".\n\nSo there you have it.

While Hebrew did have words for things that could be dirty words before Modern Hebrew, most of them were used as neutral words for bodily functions/body parts/etc.  Nearly all Modern Hebrew profanities are loaned from other languages, particularly Arabic.  While some are just loaned (such as *kus* or *sharmuta*), some are calques, or direct translations, such as saying kus ima shelkha as a direct translation of Arabic kus emak.  English profanities also are fairly widely used in Modern Hebrew.\n\nThere are a few native Hebrew terms, though.  One is *zona*, which is a classical Hebrew term for prostitute.  Early speakers would've learned that word and started applying it negatively, usually by calling people *ben-zona* (son of a *zona*).  One very productive term is *zayin*, which is the name of the 7th letter of the alphabet.  In classical Hebrew it meant \"sword\", which is used in some languages for a euphemism for the penis.  In Hebrew it's especially fitting, since the letter looks vaguely phallic.  It's used in lots of phrases with regular verbs to express various emotions.  Plus the verb form, lezayen, roughly means \"to fuck\".  There are a few more that are more clearly relatively new euphemisms, such as using *lidfok* (to push, knock, hit) to mean \"to screw\".\n\nSo there you have it.

The Armia Krajowa was politically more diverse than for example the Communist Partisans in Yugoslavia but they also can be described as a large popular movement fighting against occupiers of their country, seeking to establish a new political order; one in which Poland was oppressed neither by the Soviets nor by the Nazis. They were also not successful at the end of the war due to the Soviet suppression they had to suffer when the Red Army marched into Poland.\n\nNow, if you are asking about the reason there was no revolution in Germany, the potential answers are rather debate in scholarship and are very multifaceted.

On the more extreme end of things, figures like Bibi Netanyahu and Sam Harris have elevated al-Husseini into a key decision maker within the Third Reich state apparatus.   \n\nThe problem is that Al-Husseini's role in the Third Reich has been the subject of a good deal of politically-influenced  embellishment where it becomes hard to disentangle myth from fact- /u/commiespaceinvader's has done an excellent job summarizing the Mufti's storied career in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4d0jnc/was_the_haj_amin_alhusseini_ever_tried_for_war/). \n\nFor the most part, the historical record does not bear out Harris's picture of Palestinian history. Firstly, although al-Husseini was an important political figure in the interwar period, he was far from the only one and to call him the \"leader of the Palestinians\" is to impose a political unity that was not present in the Mandate. There were other Palestinian national leaders, but al-Husseini's activities in the Third Reich has led to him being elevated above others, some for legitimate scholarly reasons, others to delegitimize the Palestinian national movement (tellingly, the essay on Palestine in the anthology [*Arab Responses to Fascism and Nazism Attraction and Repulsion*](http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/gerara) is entitled \"More than the Mufti: Other Arab-Palestinian Voices on Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945, and Their Postwar Narrations\" underscores the outsized importance of al-Husseini and how some historians are tired of it). \n\nThe charge that al-Husseini visited Auschwitz largely comes from one source, Dieter Wisliceny, and the linked answer from out almighty moderator does show why Wisleceny is rather problematic source. Harris's invocation of Auschwitz is indicative of a wider problem when it comes to popular accounts (i.e. journalists, intellectuals, etc.) that examine al-Husseini. The Holocaust was an incredibly complicated process both in its genesis and execution. There is a marked tendency to assign blame in some way to al-Husseini for the Holocaust, whether through refusing to allow Jews access to Palestine or giving Hitler the idea for genocide. Sam Harris in particualr danced very closely to this line of argumentation, but the reality was al-Husseini was an incredibly marginal figure inside the Third Reich. Neither Himmler nor Hitler needed much prodding for genocide, especially from a non-European. \n\nFinally, by not bringing out this wider context, Harris is presenting an incredibly skewed picture of al-Husseini's activities within occupied Europe. After the failure of the Iraq revolt in 1941, al-Husseini ended in Europe and worked for the German propaganda machine. But in doing so, he had to compete with other anti-British Arab emigres and navigate the various factions within the German state apparatus. Al-Husseini's anti-Jewish sentiments put him in ideological resonance with the SS, but in light of other emigre competitors like Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, making an alliance with this particular power bloc had a certain political logic behind it. Al-Gaylani's more secular and pan-Arabist politics had found support both in the Italian and German Foreign Ministries and he was in many ways a more \"current\" leader against the British, having participated in the Iraqi revolt in 1941. Al-Husseini's main stand against the British had occurred a generation earlier in 1929.  Making the most of his connections to Himmler was a way for al-Husseini to gain the paltry resources the Axis devoted to the Arab cause away from an emerging rival. \n\nThe above does not to excuse nor does it mitigate al-Husseini's wartime activities.  Now al-Husseini very much fits into the mold of being a bad man and a fool, but looking beyond his propaganda broadcasts there was a discernible desperation in his activities for the Third Reich to recognize the cause of Arab independence and place him at the head of it. This was a step that Hitler was unwilling to make. He helped in the recruitment of Bosnian Muslims in the SS Handschar Division, but he was often quite frustrated that the Germans did not put much weight behind his efforts and the Handschar was not used to fight for Arab independence. The Handschar's activities were localized in Bosnia and although it was involved in war crimes and other massacres, its relationship with the larger German military establishment was strained and largely a failure. \n\nSo while al-Husseini's activities in 1929 and the mid-30s put him at the starting point for Palestinian national activism, when you remove the moral revulsion from his wartime activities in Germany, al-Husseini emerges as a rather pathetic figure. As an exile, he found himself having to gain the favor of two states whose leaders who at best only supported his cause for tactical reasons. Neither Mussolini nor Hitler saw much use for the Arab world beyond the immediate tactical use of Arab nationalism to disrupt the British. By hitching his star to what was soon apparent to be a losing power in occupied Europe, al-Husseini was out of circulation with the wider  developments within the Arab world. Al-Husseini had to reconstruct his network of political contacts after the war as well as deflect charges he was a German collaborator. So in short, al-Husseini's dalliances with National Socialism was more damaging to his political career and although he may have aspired to be \"a full-blown collaborator\", his would-be allies in Italy and Germany were mostly indifferent to him. \n"]], [[{"comment": "From an earlier [answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4wdidn/is_there_any_validity_to_sam_harris_description/) and be sure to read the follow-ups in the thread and the linked response from one of out all mighty moderators. \n\nMost of these charges about a Nazi-Muslim Axis revolves around the figure of the grand mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini.

There were other Palestinian national leaders, but al-Husseini's activities in the Third Reich has led to him being elevated above others, some for legitimate scholarly reasons, others to delegitimize the Palestinian national movement (tellingly, the essay on Palestine in the anthology [*Arab Responses to Fascism and Nazism Attraction and Repulsion*](http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/gerara) is entitled \"More than the Mufti: Other Arab-Palestinian Voices on Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945, and Their Postwar Narrations\" underscores the outsized importance of al-Husseini and how some historians are tired of it). \n\nThe charge that al-Husseini visited Auschwitz largely comes from one source, Dieter Wisliceny, and the linked answer from out almighty moderator does show why Wisleceny is rather problematic source. Harris's invocation of Auschwitz is indicative of a wider problem when it comes to popular accounts (i.e. journalists, intellectuals, etc.) that examine al-Husseini. The Holocaust was an incredibly complicated process both in its genesis and execution. There is a marked tendency to assign blame in some way to al-Husseini for the Holocaust, whether through refusing to allow Jews access to Palestine or giving Hitler the idea for genocide. Sam Harris in particualr danced very closely to this line of argumentation, but the reality was al-Husseini was an incredibly marginal figure inside the Third Reich. Neither Himmler nor Hitler needed much prodding for genocide, especially from a non-European. \n\nFinally, by not bringing out this wider context, Harris is presenting an incredibly skewed picture of al-Husseini's activities within occupied Europe. After the failure of the Iraq revolt in 1941, al-Husseini ended in Europe and worked for the German propaganda machine. But in doing so, he had to compete with other anti-British Arab emigres and navigate the various factions within the German state apparatus. Al-Husseini's anti-Jewish sentiments put him in ideological resonance with the SS, but in light of other emigre competitors like Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, making an alliance with this particular power bloc had a certain political logic behind it. Al-Gaylani's more secular and pan-Arabist politics had found support both in the Italian and German Foreign Ministries and he was in many ways a more \"current\" leader against the British, having participated in the Iraqi revolt in 1941. Al-Husseini's main stand against the British had occurred a generation earlier in 1929.  Making the most of his connections to Himmler was a way for al-Husseini to gain the paltry resources the Axis devoted to the Arab cause away from an emerging rival. \n\nThe above does not to excuse nor does it mitigate al-Husseini's wartime activities.  Now al-Husseini very much fits into the mold of being a bad man and a fool, but looking beyond his propaganda broadcasts there was a discernible desperation in his activities for the Third Reich to recognize the cause of Arab independence and place him at the head of it. This was a step that Hitler was unwilling to make. He helped in the recruitment of Bosnian Muslims in the SS Handschar Division, but he was often quite frustrated that the Germans did not put much weight behind his efforts and the Handschar was not used to fight for Arab independence. The Handschar's activities were localized in Bosnia and although it was involved in war crimes and other massacres, its relationship with the larger German military establishment was strained and largely a failure. \n\nSo while al-Husseini's activities in 1929 and the mid-30s put him at the starting point for Palestinian national activism, when you remove the moral revulsion from his wartime activities in Germany, al-Husseini emerges as a rather pathetic figure. As an exile, he found himself having to gain the favor of two states whose leaders who at best only supported his cause for tactical reasons. Neither Mussolini nor Hitler saw much use for the Arab world beyond the immediate tactical use of Arab nationalism to disrupt the British. By hitching his star to what was soon apparent to be a losing power in occupied Europe, al-Husseini was out of circulation with the wider  developments within the Arab world. Al-Husseini had to reconstruct his network of political contacts after the war as well as deflect charges he was a German collaborator. So in short, al-Husseini's dalliances with National Socialism was more damaging to his political career and although he may have aspired to be \"a full-blown collaborator\", his would-be allies in Italy and Germany were mostly indifferent to him. \n", "id": "d9nbozq"}]]], "3xaqun": ["What do you think of ancient aliens?", "2015-12-18 06:06:08", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3xaqun/what_do_you_think_of_ancient_aliens/", [[3, "The show or the theory in general?

You are quite right in saying that the Northern states did not initially conceive of the war as a war to end slavery by force; the shift towards an anti-slavery agenda, though, comes quite quickly. Within a year or two of the war beginning Lincoln's administration already has its mind set on how to bring slavery to an end, though it does not yet adopt a policy of immediate and total abolition; in late 1862, Lincoln essentially issues a warning statement to the Southern states that he is preparing to issue the Emancipation Proclamation and that if they have any hope of preserving slavery, they would need to rejoin the Union immediately.\n\nFrom the first day of 1863, the Union effectively made slavery's end a driving goal of the war through the Emancipation Proclamation; though the Proclamation did not abolish slavery, it provided for the freedom of the vast majority of slaves in the United States as a war measure, which in essence declared the Union's intention to decimate the institution of slavery. For much of the war, Lincoln and his administration were actively trying to conceive a solution to the problem of slavery that would secure the institution's end - his own initial preference was a policy of gradual compensation emancipation, whereby the government would purchase the freedom of all slaves. This was the policy that the British pursued in their colonial territories but in the United States, it would likely have proven financially impossible to reach a deal with the Southern elite, most of who had no interest in accepting as a matter of principle anyway (an attempt to secure compensated emancipation in Delaware had ended in utter failure).\n\nSo even if the federal government did not enter into the war with ambitions to pursue an abolitionist agenda, the experience of the Civil War quite quickly shifts its priorities towards the end of slavery. From at least 1863 onwards we can say that the Civil War was effectively being prosecuted in the interests of fatally damaging the institution of slavery as well as reunifying the nation, a reality that was not lost on the Southern elite, who simply saw the shift in priorities as confirmation of their underlying fears that the Republican Party was hell-bent on abolition.\n\n> but the Union didn't go to war with them over slavery, it was over the secession itself (aka, the federal government asserting its dominance over the states. In this case, their right to self-determination).\n\nThere are two fundamental problems with this argument. The first is that there is and was no legal mechanism by which the Southern states were entitled to secede from the Union. The Constitution does not provide for the sovereignty of any individual State, and explicitly afforded the federal government the power of determining the use of its territory, whilst at the same time requiring the United States to provide for the protection of its constituent members. Each of the Southern legislatures was bound by Article 6 of the Constitution to uphold its provisions, and decades before secession the Supreme Court had affirmed the supremacy of federal law over state law when the balance between the two is not constitutionally defined (see *McCulloch v. Maryland*). Even before the modern federation was formed, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 was explicit in declaring that \"the said territory, and the States which may be formed therein, shall forever remain a part of this Confederacy of the United States of America\". In other words, even under the weaker Articles of Confederation, the now-states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota would not have a legal right to secede - and those Articles *did* state the each member \"retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence\".\n\nYou can make a moral argument that states *ought* to have a right to secede from the union at will, but the North was certainly acting in a fashion perfectly compatible with the constitutional order of the United States, and the Civil War cannot be legitimately interpreted through a framework of states' rights versus federal authority in the way that this argument implies. There is simply no strong legal or constitutional basis for secession even before the Civil War. This was affirmed after the Civil War in the *Texas v. White* case, which found that when \"Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation\", and that secession is only possible where it is by mutual consent - in other words, a state perhaps has a right to *request* to leave the Union but the granting of that request is conditional upon agreement with the other states. One state could not unilaterally secede - no such right existed within the USA's constitutional fabric.\n\nThe other problem with this interpretation is that it is one of the key ways in which Confederate apologists seek to take away from slavery as the driving theme of the Civil War. They try to distract from the issue by recasting it as a struggle for states' rights, arguing that even if slavery is abhorrent, it was just the unfortunate issue over which the wider struggle for states' rights was fought (assuming slavery's significance is not almost completely excised from the discussion, which is very common with Lost Cause apologism). Unfortunately, though the Southern states do take up the language of ideas about states' rights to make their argument, any principled commitment to that value was always secondary to the interests of slavery as an institution. In the run up to the Civil War the Southern elite was not advocating for greater State autonomy - they were on the contrary demanding that the federal government be *more* involved in the government and laws of the States, in the sense that they expected it to do whatever it could to enforce the provisions of laws like the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which along with the Dred Scott case served to give slavery an institutional and legal presence even in the states that wanted nothing to do with it.\n\nIn other words, the Confederate states were interested in self-determination and autonomy only if it benefited the institution of slavery. Where the right to self-determination in law and government undermined that institution, they were very much eager for the federal government's powers to be enhanced. The inadequate enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act in Southern eyes, combined with the resentment of several Northern states and their determination to undermine it, was one of the great grievances of the Southern elite who pushed for secession. When secession ordinances talk about the failure of the federal government to protect their rights, they are really talking about the failure of the federal government to satisfactorily put their sectional interests ahead of and at the expense of those of other states.\n\n> The 13th Amendment was unable to be passed in the House of Reps in early 1865 (nearly the end of the war) and when it was passed later that year, it was only by a tiny margin, which was facilitated by bribes\n\nThis point is perhaps slightly disingenuous and needs clarifying. The House only passed the 13th amendment by a tiny margin, yes, but this is because constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority rather than a regular majority of half plus one. The balance of power in the House of Representatives was firmly in favour of the anti-slavery faction by 1864, and the Republican Party itself would have a two-thirds majority - and thus the numbers to pass a constitutional amendment - from March 4th, 1865. The final vote was 119 - 52, which is a huge majority for legislation in general, but narrow for a constitutional amendment.

But judging from the attitudes and actions (Emancipation Proclamation, compensation emancipation, etc.) of Lincoln's cabinet and the Republican Party, one can more-or-less conclude that slavery was the main reason for the war, at least for those statesmen.\n\nMy only question is, does the Republican majority and the actions of that government really reflect the anti-slavery attitudes of the people of the Union? I mean, I'm not surprised that the Republicans were such a large majority in the house, but how much was this because the people wanted slavery done away with, and how much was it about other stuff (like winning the war)?\n\nI just find it impossible to believe that the white people of the Union would be willing to send tens of thousands of white men to their deaths in order to free the Southern slaves, even towards the end of the war.

I didn't mean an actual legal right the states had, just the idea that groups of people ought to be able to govern themselves if they want to (especially those structurally capable of doing so); the alternative would be essentially tyranny.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind here. First, secession was not decided by true popular participation in the vast majority of states. The decision was generally taken by specially elected constitutional conventions alongside state legislatures, taking inspiration from South Carolina. Even by the standards of the day, elections to delegates to these conventions was often substandard - in Texas, for instance, many delegates were elected by a verbal vote and Unionists kept away from polling places. South Carolina's convention filled all 169 delegate seats with secessionists. In Georgia and Arkansas, more competitive elections actually produced divided conventions; in Arkansas Unionists candidates actually won about 57% of the popular vote, despite fielding fewer candidates than the secessionist bloc. In almost every state, the final decision to secede was taken by delegates elected to these conventions in often flawed processes.\n\nThat's not to say that there weren't efforts to involve the population. Arkansas' convention ultimately settled on secession, but a motion to submit that ordinance to approval by the population was overwhelmingly rejected for fear it would be defeated (although Arkansas did hold a referendum on whether or not a convention should be held in the first place). North Carolina rejected a proposed referendum for similar fears. The only state convention that gave its voters the final say was Texas, where 77% of voters approved the proposal, in another ballot fraught with intermediation, error and low turnout. 60,900 people voted in the 1861 referendum compared to the 78,000 who had voted in the 1856 presidential election.\n\nSo this is fundamentally different to what happened in, say, Quebec in 1995, where every adult Canadian resident in Quebec was eligible to vote for or against independence for that province in a normal, private ballot. It's a much more indirect, much less transparent process than that, and it was flawed even by the standards of the day; that several conventions rejected the idea of a popular referendum suggests a lack of confidence in their capacity to win one. The secessionist movement also failed to fully respect the wishes of those states that rejected secession. Missouri held a convention election in 1861 also, and nearly every seat to the convention was won by a unionist candidate. That result was not respected by the state Governor, who was pro-secession, nor the Confederacy. Secessionists still insisted the State was part of the Confederacy and Missouri was paradoxically both a member of the federal government and the Confederate government, with the latter delegation functioning as a government-in-exile until the South could invade and secure the State (such a thing never happened of course). Once again, the interests of slavery trumped any commitment to principles of self-determination.\n\nAnd of course, we must remember that almost half of the South's population consisted of enslaved African Americans at this time. They were people who were denied even the most basic rights, liberties and claims to self-determination; they were exploited in the most extreme way imaginable and denied any claim not just to citizenship, but to Human dignity. We must never lose sight of that when we talk about the Confederacy. Likewise, this is an age in which only a portion of the population was eligible to vote: there were about 26million adults in the United States in 1860, and probably fewer than 6million were eligible to vote in the 1860 presidential election. We must be extremely careful to look back at the secession process and not read too much significance for modern political process into it. This was not a process that any of us today would look upon as legitimate. Though I agree with the principle of your statement for the modern world, in 1860 it was secession that was essentially a tyrannical process for the vast majority of the Southern population. It's only in 1856 that every white man gets the right to vote across the United States; full and equal suffrage for minorities and for women is still decades away.\n\n> My only question is, does the Republican majority and the actions of that government really reflect the anti-slavery attitudes of the people of the Union?\n\nAnd what I've just said above naturally ties into this: just as Southern government and secession was far from representative, so too was Northern government. Unpicking the motivations behind voting intentions in this period is a very complex, if not outright impossible, task; this is a long time before opinion polling exists and a huge section of the population had no say in any given formal political process. Certainly there were many people who were fearful that the abolition of slavery would be bad for them by flooding the labour market with cheap unskilled labour in the form of ex-slaves; the vast majority of people in this period were also still likely to hold racially prejudiced views and be weary of advances towards African American equality. But the Republican Party was certainly not shy about its intentions in the 1864 elections: the Republican platform included a commitment to a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery immediately and without compensation, and to prosecute the war to the final surrender of the Confederacy. The Democratic platform made no reference to slavery but committed itself to immediate peace talks and implied the possibility of invalidating the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nSo I don't think that it's illegitimate to claim the 1864 victory an endorsement of an anti-slavery platform. The Republican Party's proposal would have been extremely and dangerously radical even just 15 years prior, but could now be promised as part of its mainstream election campaign and does not seem to have done much, if anything, to curb the party's landslide. I would certainly suggest that the movie *Lincoln* gets it right in saying that many people's first and foremost interest was restoring the Union, and the crippling split in Democratic ranks severely undermined the legitimacy of their peace strategy (how do you negotiate a peace conference when you can't even resolve your own problems?), which had already been compromised by the dramatic turn of the war in favour of the Union through 1864.\n\nBut clearly there was not enough fear and alarm over the prospect of emancipation, which was made a central theme of the Republican campaign, to encourage a shift to the Democrats. It's often assumed that the 1864 election was biased in favour of Lincoln due to the absence of the Southern states; the reality is that the electoral battleground slightly favoured the Democratic Party. If just 5 in every 100 people who voted Republic in 1864 had voted Democrat instead, that would have given George McCellan a 123 - 110 margin of victory in the electoral college, even though Lincoln would have beaten him in the popular vote 50.5% to 49.5%.^[1] So though Republicans did win a landslide in the electoral college and the House, that's very much a product of the electoral system - Lincoln could easily have lost and it was in many ways a closely contested poll. But compared to 1860, when the two Democratic candidates took 48% to Lincoln's 39%, that still clearly represents a huge swing to the Republicans in just a few years.\n\nSo you're right to be cautious about the interpretation of the result but abolition can't be completely removed from it, either. It was a key issue for the Republican Party, who made massive gains across the board openly campaigning for the 13th Amendment as their top legislative priority. People were weary and pragmatic, yes, but certainly also sufficiently anti-slavery to embrace that platform. The exact balance of interests is something that I would suggest we simply can't know, though - voters behave in complex ways, and it is essentially impossible for us to speculate on the precise balance of motives for millions of white men we know very little about, compared to modern voters who are poked and prodded relentlessly by opinion pollsters and sociological surveys.\n\n> The movie (I know its just a movie), makes a clear point that the average Northern bloke was only anti-slavery if it would hasten the ending of the war - and the fact there was still a good number of Dems in Congress (60+?) would suggest this also.\n\nOn this point, the Congress portrayed in the movie - and the one that passed the 13th Amendment - was the 38th Congress, which had been elected in 1862 and 1863. Those elections took place when the war was uncertain, the economy was faltering and there were fears about what exactly emancipation was going to look like and what impact it would have. The Democrats did capitalise on those fears to make gains in 1862, especially in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio, but those gains were dramatically reversed with Lincoln's re-election in 1864. Part of the rationale of passing the amendment in the 38th Congress was that it would need bipartisan support, and the lame duck session created dozens of Democrats who had no electorates to be beholden to; that bipartisan support would make it much harder to portray the amendment as the Republican Party imposing its will on the nation with its new supermajority, as well as hasten the process of abolition.\n\n**Notes**\n\n^[1] Lincoln won 55% of the national vote.
