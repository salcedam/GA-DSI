The biggest concern was drawing Ramsey out of the castle, regardless of how many men Jon had, because his whole point in rushing his attack was the need to consolidate the North as soon as possible and unite it against the White Walkers before they attack The Wall.\n\nI think it's very likely that Jon and almost certainly Davos, would have used the Valemen in a similar type surprise attack, which shutters the defense that Sansa had to do what she did or Jon would have lost anyway. \n\nIt's dumb that the writers made Jon throw his life away (and Sansa's and Bran's) and let his house's legacy disappear at a hopeless attempt to avenge his baby brother when he had nearly all the information he needed to make the best choice in the moment. It's dumb that Jon ran towards the arrows instead of backwards. It's dumb that Davos was really forced to charge and abandoned his defensive position.

Jon is a cocksure immortal with more than just Rickon to avenge. He has tunnel vision, which was highlighted through the fact that he and Sansa argued about it. He had to run forward under the approaching arrows; if he ran back they would have caught him for sure (no lord of light theory here, just logic). he was already caught in the trap the moment he charged for Rickon. charging forward was the safer gamble, and it still didn't work out. That's not dumb, that's a substantial lesson. One Jon suddenly realized he needed to pay for when he saw the entire mounted force coming straight for him alone on the field. Davos was forced to charge because his role, and that of the archers, was nullified by Jon falling for the trap, coupled with Davos' good nature. Why would Davos remain in a defensive position that doesn't need to be defended when the battle is happening yards away? It was a desperate move, and it, too, failed. Perhaps what the creators are trying to say is that heroism isn't about making all the right decisions at the right times, it's about taking responsibility for the situation you find yourself in, regardless of the scenario you prepared for, and fighting with everything you've got right to the very end even if you know it's a losing battle. You call it dumb, the rest of us see a little more than that.", "id": "d4i60e7"}, {"comment": "We're going to have to respectfully agree to disagree, as many others have pointed out that these are not character defining moments, they are the result of bad writing.  And when I say dumb, I really mean inconsistent and unfulfilling in a way that lives up to the characters' passed experiences.\n\nI do not fault Jon for charging to save Rickon, that's believable for his character. I fault him for charging after Rickon dies, as he has faced emotional pain before and didn't react so irrationally, and he knows he is the main pillar to reinstate his family. He knows Sansa will kill herself if Jon fails. He knows the North will be lost forever, the wildlings (all of the women and children), Lady Mormont, and all his men and he knows the White Walkers won't be stopped in The North. \n\nHe values the lives of the people he serves with and he's not a selfish character. Why would he risk everything for an obviously futile attempt at reaching Ramsey? Has he learned nothing from the losing his father, mother and siblings to \"the game of thrones\"? This isn't naive season one Jon, this is a battered and hardened man that sees the bigger picture, the war to come. \n\nThe whole reason he wanted to attack Winterfell asap was to unite the North against the White Walkers. He made the battle plans (with Davos), he agreed they were their only shot at winning. He knows what had to be done. Yes, his brother was a setback, and heartbreaking, and a distraction, but Jon is smarter than that. It is completely out of character.\n\nA common argument for Jon is that he had to run forward to escape the arrows, but moments later he barely escapes a second volley (but his horse dies) and then proceeds to live through multiple other volleys on foot. There is no logic in this situation. He could have just the same turned around immediately or immediately after dodging the first volley and likely escaped.\n\nAlso realize that had he saved Rickon, they would still be in the situation Jon was in, but worse, because he would be closer to the archers since he didn't appear to be slowing down as he planned to swoop Rickon up. So then would you agree they could have escaped or would they both have to charge the Bolton line?\n\nFor Davos, we don't really disagree. It was a tough call, no doubt about that. Morale and Future vs Hopeless odds. I don't agree with your logic on the battle taking place in the middle, because there was no main battle, just Jon, albeit, he had reason to save Jon. If you're referring to the infantry charging, I can agree with that...but it was too late already anyways.\n\nWhy did Jon's army stand in a circle and do nothing when Ramsey's infantry phalanx surrounded them? Did none of them realize what was happening? Did they not know it's a bad idea to be encircled? They weren't helpless. Why couldn't Wun break through the ranks? Why didn't Wun have a weapon?\n\nYou're absolutely right about the characters having to deal with their decisions, and that's what makes this such a great show. Unfortunately, Jon didn't really pay for his actions, at least not directly, his army did. Davos didn't either. Neither did Sansa.\n", "id": "d4ibazz"}, {"comment": "It seems the issue is our perspectives on who Jon is. You seem to think he is smart. I don't think he is that smart.

Regarding the wildlings getting surrounded... you serious? You know they are an uneducated people? (see: Gilly and books. Tormund and strategy.) The wildlings have never face a foe that encircles their enemies with and impenetrable wall of shields and spears, let alone know what to do when you are in that situation.

It's actually quite disgusting of an action because all of those men AND WUN WUN... FUCKING WUN WUN... die because... why? We don't know? She wasn't helpful at all to Jon in their pre-battle council. ", "id": "d4hi78k"}, {"comment": ">we knew they would and that's why it's cliche. \n\nI mean. We didn't really know for sure. We knew they would try to get there as fast as they could. But we didn't know if they would get there too late and have to rescue Jon from the keep. I mean cliche is something that is overused right? And as far as an army coming in at the last second to save someone (although that is super broad) it has literally only happened for Jon one other time. A far cry from overused. And even when Jon was saved from Mance's army it wasn't a poor tactical decision that he was saved from, it was a decision that was the only way he could win. \n\nWhat we're seeing is a pattern. That is the second time Jon has needed saving from an army. And in art there is a rule of three. Things are more powerful in threes. Just because we've seen something similar doesn't make it cliche. Sure if every major battle in Game of Thrones had someone save them then we can talk about a cliche and some trite story-telling. But last time I checked Stannis got owned. The Battle of Blackwater was won by ingenuity. The Mother of Dragons has been saved by her Drogo all of once, the rest have been planned assaults. \n\nI mean I just don't see enough of an *identical* or close enough to it re-washing to throw around words like \"cliche\". \n\nBut the other points you're talking about have nothing to do with OP's cliche remarks, buuuut I'd love to talk about them cuz...I mean come on, Game of Thrones right?\n\nBut I agree Sansa probably should have mentioned to Jon about the army but you can see in the preview for the next ep that it's a point of contention as Jon talks to her about \"trusting him\". I mean she doesn't know who to trust anymore because her own aunt ended up wanting her dead. So she's not sure she can trust Jon. And as far as her help to Jon in their pre-battle council. She definitely would never be helpful in that meeting in a million years. Hell the only reason she was there was so Jon could keep an eye on her (as far as I'm concerned). But if you think about it, she went form sewing and learning decorum to being Joffrey's play thing to being despised by her aunt to being Bolton's toy. I mean she really hasn't had time to wrap her head around the finer points of battle strategy or to get her head on straight for being tortured for years and not to mention raped by a psychopath.

Notice how after Robert's death he immediately wants to marry Cersei off, but Tywin was still a bachelor since his wife's death. Punishes Tyrion (and gang rapes a young woman) for whoring, but he fucks Shae. He says he does things for the family but to me it looks like he's just a control freak.\n\n> Kidnapped Tyrion whilst having literally no proof. I mean, things can be stolen. She pretty much caused a war. I know it was LF manipulating her, but come on.\n\nTo be fair, a bit of this was fear for her son. If she had just given him a fair trial and not endangered Tyrion's life/thrown him in a sky cell, it'd be a bit better. Still irresponsible of her though.\n\n> She killed Walder Frey's wife. This is literally what Jaime did to Bran. Murder someone for no reason. \n\nI can forgive this one. Her son (and also grandson in the show) were just murdered right before her eyes, betrayed by those she thought were her allies. She rage-quitted on the way out.\n\nI actually like Catelyn's character a lot. I like that in this world nobody is really purely good or purely evil. I mean in season 2 and 3, she and Robb are the good guys that you're rooting for to win the throne. How often in shows do you see the good guy pray for the death of a small child because of its mother? I like the depth this show gives its characters."], [3, "LITERALLY no proof, except for the almost-literal smoking gun that she had.

She gives Robb a lot of sound advice throughout the campaign. \n\nShe does put Jaime free, but only because she's convinced that he won't survive the night anyhow. Her hand is forced by less than optimal circumstances. \n\nShe certainly loathes Jon with a passion. But that's a very human thing to do. She wants to force herself into loving him, but the heart isn't always so cooperative. Especially not, I imagine, in someone whose house had always put family before everything. Her inability to forgive Ned speaks of the high standards she is holding him to, and perhaps also on an intuitive level she has grown to know Ned well enough to feel that there's something that's just not right about the story. Her unconscious suspicion that Ned is keeping the truth from her might be the cause of a lot of the pain she feels when she regards Jon.\n\nCat is not a perfect character. That's what makes her relatable and interesting to me at least.

Her life was falling apart and so she was slightly rude. And then she was kinder after to make up for it. Have some empathy for her. This is nothing.\n\n5. Yeah, that's murder. But the woman most likely was aware of what was going to happen. So fuck her.\n\nJaime killed Bran so that a secret that would cause a civil war be kept secret.

It only considers it from our point of view as the audience and what we know - it's not considering Cat's perspective at all. 1. - Praying for Jon's death is quite harsh but she shows remorse towards it, it was probably was done on a whim. Cat was the one who had to suffer due to Jon's existence (a huge stain on her honor without explanation from her husband). And please how many fucking people in the show broke their word? 2. - Disliking a living reminder of your husband's adultery is something normal and human I think, especially in Cat's position. Furthermore she could hardly openly hate her husband in the patriarchal world of GoT, on top of that she has multiple children with that man. Holding Ned responsible would only make her own and her families lives more difficult, whereas focusing her hate in Jon would not cause as many problems. 3. - Seriously this is the most fucked up point in your entire argumentation, it is so damn biased from the viewer's perspective. It is not trying to empathise with Cat at all. LF loved her during their childhood, they were on very good terms - it is very very reasonable from her POV to assume that he is speaking the truth. On top of that, like Ned, she isnt used to the intrigue going on in court. Kidnapping Tyrion was also done on a whim, but actually quite reasonable considering her position - it was the only chance to get her hands on him, whereas letting him go would bring up questions and put her into a difficult position anyways. 4. - If you think it is that bad.... I've not paid that much attention to how the two of them interacted, I only paid attention to the story related to Jon in that case. Anyways having some bad temper is different from being heartless I think. 5. - Well, is it that heartless? What Walder and Roose did to her was heartless. They didnt react to her terms after she took the girl hostage, her hate for Frey must have been tremendous. Yeah that girl wasn't at fault, but humans aren't purely kind or purely evil (a point the show is trying to make a lot) - wishing for vengeance or revenge is human.

It only considers it from our point of view as the audience and what we know - it's not considering Cat's perspective at all. 1. - Praying for Jon's death is quite harsh but she shows remorse towards it, it was probably was done on a whim. Cat was the one who had to suffer due to Jon's existence (a huge stain on her honor without explanation from her husband). And please how many fucking people in the show broke their word? 2. - Disliking a living reminder of your husband's adultery is something normal and human I think, especially in Cat's position. Furthermore she could hardly openly hate her husband in the patriarchal world of GoT, on top of that she has multiple children with that man. Holding Ned responsible would only make her own and her families lives more difficult, whereas focusing her hate in Jon would not cause as many problems. 3. - Seriously this is the most fucked up point in your entire argumentation, it is so damn biased from the viewer's perspective. It is not trying to empathise with Cat at all. LF loved her during their childhood, they were on very good terms - it is very very reasonable from her POV to assume that he is speaking the truth. On top of that, like Ned, she isnt used to the intrigue going on in court. Kidnapping Tyrion was also done on a whim, but actually quite reasonable considering her position - it was the only chance to get her hands on him, whereas letting him go would bring up questions and put her into a difficult position anyways. 4. - If you think it is that bad.... I've not paid that much attention to how the two of them interacted, I only paid attention to the story related to Jon in that case. Anyways having some bad temper is different from being heartless I think. 5. - Well, is it that heartless? What Walder and Roose did to her was heartless. They didnt react to her terms after she took the girl hostage, her hate for Frey must have been tremendous. Yeah that girl wasn't at fault, but humans aren't purely kind or purely evil (a point the show is trying to make a lot) - wishing for vengeance or revenge is human.

How could anyone feel sympathetic to Cat after that? \n\nShe never gets pissy with Talisa because there is no Talisa, Robb marries a different girl for different reasons and we hardly ever see them interact. \n\nShe doesn't kill Walder's wife, she kills Jinglebell, a fool. Arguably killing a fool is as bad as killing an innocent woman but it is a difference.\n\nTo me in the books she is much more a parallel with Cersei, a mother who loves her children; except Cat also loves her husband.  She is haunted with fear and worry for her children. All she wants is to go back to Winterfell and live out their lives and see them grow up and get married and have children. She nearly goes mad with grief when she gets word that Bran and Rickon are \"dead\" and that's what drives her to release Jamie to try to get Sansa and Arya back. \n\nAs a mom myself I definitely liked and related to her a lot more than most people on this sub seem to.

I am not saying it's not, I am just saying it's a point to think on.  One thing all of GRMM and specifically the showrunners love to do is troll the fans on this prophecy with nods, winks, easter eggs, etc.  Is it possible that the Azor Ahai may not just be one person, but several people?  Also, about the sword portion of the prophecy, how can Oathkeeper possibly be Lightbringer when it was forged in the manner it was, beheading such an honourable man and taking the Stark House sword and forging Oathkeeper partly from that - it just seems like that is totally absurd that the payoff would be that it is Lightbringer, just doesn't make sense, no offense.", "id": "d5987lp"}, {"comment": "None taken and you brought to light valid points I hadn't considered.\n\nWe are gonna only really know when it is revealed.

So Lightbringer, perhaps being the most straight forward part of the prophecy, and considering what we saw with Stannis, that it can't be just any sword, Lightbringer has to special and unique.

Just saying that I feel the maker of this video skewed his interpretation of the scenes because he happens to like one character more than the other - which is also perfectly fine.

It waters down real appreciation of the work in favor of twelfth man headbutting.\n\nFavoring one aspect of the series, and even a character's journey in its entirety, is largely a matter of personal preference, not inherent fault with the material, *especially* in the case of favoring Jon over Daenerys. \n\nDany's bloodline plays a *tremendous* role in her ascension. The idea that she is destined for the throne, and that the otherworldly indicators of this rite inspire people before she even speaks a word is *integral* to her role in the story.\n\nWhen adapting this to screen, D&D understood this and tried to show her strength as an individual in spite of this. This is why they made sure Dany herself eliminated all of the Khals in the Dosh Khaleen, and not have Drogon swoop in and save the day or Jorah and Daario rescue her. They make this abundantly clear when discussing the issue in featurettes regarding Dany and that episode in particular.\n\nBut you'd have to willfully ignore that if you were looking to serve some silly reductive pissing contest between Jon and Dany, as if it was as simple as \"I invest myself more readily in this story than that story, so this story must simply be better\"."], [13, "I feel so dumb saying this but I don't know if I've ever been as invested in a fictional character as I am with Jon Snow.

And yet one earns it and the other doesn't.\n\nJon earns the respect of the people because of his \"tenacity in the field, ferocity in battle, refusal to give up, risks he takes giving mercy, attempts to rescue as many wildlings as possible\". Dany earns the respect of her people for similar reasons. Even though she didn't have to, she bluffed her way into freeing thousands of slaves because she knows how it feels to be bought and sold. She put aside her dream to go home to Westeros in order to free Slaver's Bay and rule Meereen. Not only did she brought the Dothraki to a heel which is in itself an additional blow to the slave trade, but they also respect her.\n\nThose who follow Jon don't care he doesn\u2019t have a name. The Unsullied follow Dany through belief in her cause, the Dothraki through belief in her strength, not because of her name.\n\nJon could easily let it all end in the battle. So did Dany. She could have given up many times already and yet she hasn't, instead she goes on and takes risks that until now happened to pay off. \n\nJon is in the field making an active difference. Dany doesn't know how to wield a sword but she happens to know how to control a dragon. Jon had a master at arms who instructed him since he was a little boy. \n\nJon had no name, no title, no lands, no throne. Dany had no home, no family, no wealth, no lands, no throne, just a name. Jon found a direwolf. Dany hatched three dragons. \n\n>She hasn\u2019t done anything to lead. All her accomplishments are the result of her name, the blood running in her veins, and her Targaryen heat resistance. \n\nYes she did get the dragon eggs because of her name but other characters got wealth, education, etc, because of who they are too. It doesn't make much sense to criticize Dany for it but give every other noble a pass. Her dragons were very small and frail for the most part of the story. Yes she used one of them as a supposed payment for an army just like other characters have used gold, the rest was her own planning and cunning and later the help of the slaves and supporters too. While Dany seems to be fire resistant, other characters have physical strength, a way with words, etc, so it's debatable in my opinion. \n\nOne can like one character more than the other.

He's also had his ass saved through no real ability of his own in the aforementioned fight with Karl 'Fookin' Tanner, when rezzed by Mel and twice again by his own and then the Vale's cavalry.\n\nJon's charge into the field to save Rickon arguably killed hundreds if not thousands of his men.\n\nDany has her dragons and immunity to flame which are hers by blood, the same as Jon's strength of body.

This is why they made sure Dany herself eliminated all of the Khals in the Dosh Khaleen, and not have Drogon swoop in and save the day or Jorah and Daario rescue her. They make this abundantly clear when discussing the issue in featurettes regarding Dany and that episode in particular.\n\nBut you'd have to willfully ignore that if you were looking to serve some silly reductive pissing contest between Jon and Dany, as if it was as simple as \"I invest myself more readily in this story than that story, so this story must simply be better\".", "id": "d573so6"}, {"comment": "While I don't dislike Danny as much as some people here seem to.

I don't find these scenes out of character as a bearish woman who can fight seems like the kind of woman he'd be attracted to and I've yet to come across someone who doesn't find his looks funny. Varys has indeed been outspoken to people especially when gauging their intentions including dangerous people like littlefinger.

This season seems almost like a fanfic. They're killing off characters without much explanation, and added in random comedy things that don't seem to fit with the rest of the show. Pycelle farting? I never would have expected that... and it was so subtle too almost like one of the sound engineers slipped it in because they thought it was funny that none of the producers/executives would notice.

I think in an effort to kind of make up for the things they didn't know about since it hasn't been specifically written yet they took some liberties that made it seem like there are holes in the story. When people sense a hole they try to fill it with an explanation, like \"oh they must have made Arya act really confident and throwing money around because it wasn't actually her, or it was a trap for the waif.\" I think they just tried to move her story towards the end goal, and without very specific instruction from the books, got a little sloppy in how it played to the audience.

They either don't want to introduce the changes slowly/organically, or  they just don't have the writing chops to make it happen.  \n\nJust looking at the volume of writing that GRRM's expected to deliver for the last two books, compared to the rate the show was converting the existing books to the screen, the show *should* have at minimum a full 8 seasons, and likely 5+ episodes past that.  These next two shorter seasons can't work without cutting most of the ending development out completely.  \n\nAnd it's just been doubly frustrating when there have been plenty of really good theories proposed to fill in the holes in the show.  It'd have been nice to see some of that on the screen, different from the books or not, but instead we're getting more and more no-surprise generic-TV dross.

Honestly she easily has more \"setup\" like that than any of the other Starks.  If she dies then none of that makes any sense.  She, specifically, is set up to \"do things.\"  Taken in the context of the foreshadowing and known events surrounding the other children, there's quite a lot to expect.  I don't have the time to write out full details (you should be able to search here or on Google to find most of it pretty easily), but just for example, the idea that Arya will return to Westeros and be personally responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people, and likely the extinction of at least one House, is a common one.  It's possible she'll even pick up a few helpers along the way, leading people during her killing spree (like Arya's direwolf Nymeria and her namesake Queen Nymeria).  The books lay it on thick with Arya, but similar details have paid off with Robb and Jon, and they are still on track for Sansa, Bran, and even Rickon.  So to believe Arya is the only Stark to not follow the pattern GRRM set up just doesn't make sense.  Arya's lines up perfectly too so far, in the books.\n\nNo, the show isn't following the books, and it's become apparent this season that they don't have GRRM's help with what's left, so the Waif/Arya thing may very well happen there.  The show's already done other very stupid things, so who knows.

At it's core GoT is a series of interconnecting individual story arcs. Most stories tend to have one or two main characters, where as this story has about a dozen, none of which are the main character. This is the exact thing that allows it to be what you pointed out 1. complex in it's plots and solutions and 2. not having a main character with which your story cannot go on, means you can kill who ever you want.\n\nHowever, those features themselves aren't what make the story great. Mindless killing for the sake of shock value does not make a good story. A good kill is one which is a meaningful ending to a character's story arc, and impacts the world around him. Otherwise it's meaningless. Look at Ned's death, or Rob's death. Then compare it to the death Minor characters. Although neither have plot armor, one has more impact than the other because of the consequence it has for the story of the other characters.\n\nAs for Occam's Razor, while it's true that simplest and most obvious isn't good. Over complication and lack of realism is not good either. For example, the red wedding was a great plot point with both complexity leading up to it with foreshadowing, and complexity trailing it, with the impact it has on the 7 kingdoms. However, if you make things too convoluted without properly setting it up, and pacing it properly, it becomes just as bad as simplicity. Either extreme is bad.\n\nAlso, how was Arya getting stabbed and going to lady crane and then running through the streets to her hide out, where she turned off the candle and used needle as her weapon simple or obvious? The simple and obvious would be for her to just stay inside her little hide out, until she was found, and then killing the waif there... As for Riverrun, how was anything that happened in riverrun simple or obvious? I don't think anyone thought we'd see riverrun again. I also don't think anyone would've thought that the resolution came from everyone suddenly deciding edmure was the better choice.\n\nI believe that the opposite of what you're saying is true. Things have gotten a little too reliant on shock value and complexity, without having proper lead up. For example, the hound being alive is ridiculous. It adds pointless shock value and complexity when his purpose was already fulfilled. He was a minor character that served to further both sansa and arya's story line.\n\nAlso, not that many main characters have died in game of thrones in general. Most of them tend to stay alive, with those around them dying. Those that have died die while having a large impact on the other characters. If Jon had died he wouldn't have had much of an impact on anyone, and his story of fighting the white walkers would've ended before it even began. Same applies for Arya, if she died due to the stabbing, literally no one would know the difference. Everyone already assumes shes dead. Killing either character off in those situations would be contradictory to what game of thrones is all about, which is a story of a huge amount of interconnected characters.\n\nThe recent writing has been weak for the same reasons Riverrun was essentially a plot point that does not impact anyone. Before Riverrun Sansa wasn't getting tully reinforcements, she's still not. Before Riverrun, the Freys still held Riverrun, they still do. The only purpose it served was to further Jaime's own story line. It did a good job of doing it, but the fact that it lacked that connectivity with other main characters makes it really irrelevant. \n\nThe reason it failed so much is exactly because of the lack of any consequence for that event other than Jaime. If Jaime was besieging Riverrun while the Stark army was there, then it'd be a more tense enviorment and it'd have a bigger play off, because the stakes were higher, but because they weren't, they could write it off the way they did.\n\nEssentially, complexity is good, but only if it's meaningful to the story and well executed.", "id": "d47haws"}, {"comment": "> The recent writing has been weak for the same reasons **Riverrun** was essentially a plot point that does not impact anyone.

She's a child that witnessed the gruesome death of her father, and in order to survive had to take on several false identities. The only thing that combines all of her false identities is that she wants revenge. Essentially, her identity has been solely defined by revenge. When she comes to the house of black and white, she learns to let go of her revenge, but refuses to let go of the other aspect of her which is her family(represented by needle). She gets a lot out of the house of black and white also, she's no longer a powerless little girl who watched those who she loved get killed before he, she now has the power to defend herself and her loved ones. It's true that she still acts prideful, but her story was never about her pride. It was about her powerlessness and lack of identity, both of which were resolved by the end of this episode. I think her story arc is pretty good. The only thing is that now she doesn't have any arc at all, so they can start something new entirely. Maybe they will make her into an adventurer like she said she wanted to be. Maybe she'll go find nymeria? Idk.\n\nHowever, I don't disagree with you that they handled the arc itself pretty badly. I don't like how little her and jaquen talked, it left it vague for no reason other than to have \"mystery\". I think the concept of the house of black and white was good and the effect it had on her was good, though i think the execution was bad.\n\nAs for riverrun, here is the thing, GoT is a compilation of stories and story arcs of primary characters. Aside from the primary characters there are supporting characters. The purpose of every supporting character is solely to push the story of the primary characters. Edmure, the Freys, blackfish, and brianne are all supporting characters. They are mostly static characters, that although fleshed out sometimes, really are not the focus of the story. \n\nThe one who is the focus of the riverrun story is neither blackfish, nor brianne, nor any of the supporting characters there. It's jaime. \n\nJaime's story was really good in this episode. You see how he sees himself in edmure. You see how what edmure  says hits him home, you see how jaime is having an internal conflict. Which he is. He's conflicted between his love for his sister and his morals. There is a noticeable difference between s1 jaime and this jaime. However, he still hasn't chosen to go with his morals rather than his sister. Also, what other option did he have but the one he took? He could not stop the siege because he'd be branded a traitor and i doubt the frey's would lay down their weapons as well. \n\nI'm not saying this was well written though. It's all too static. They created this scenerio solely for the purpose of expanding Jaime's story, it'll have zero impact on anyone or anything else. \n\nConsider the beheading of Ned. This was an event which was meaningful to EVERYONE's story, while also beign meaningful to his own. That's good writing, and the ripples which that event had were meaningful. This event will have no impact. It's just a bunch of supporting characters either dying or whatever solely to flesh out jaime's own story.\n\nBasically, what i'm saying is that, yes the execution is bad, but the story arcs themselves are quite good.

However, you're right that the execution was bad. \n\nRiverrun was too shallow of a plot point. It does not impact the world at all, but only impacts Jaime. Which is bad. Compare it to Ned's beheading which is a plot point which impacts the entire show, or the red wedding, or tywin's murder, etc. There are ways of advancing personal narratives, while also impacting other character's narratives. Riverrun failed because it did not impact anyone but Jaime. \n\nBlack fish doesn't matter. He has like a total of 20 minutes screen time in the whole show, same with edmure, and the freys.

The Jaime development was amazing, it's subtle and depicts his struggle between his love and his honor. You can literally see the progress he's made compared to s1 Jaime. It's even in the dialogue. In season 1 he said the things i'd do for love, in a nonchelant way, as if without a care of the harm he's inflicting. When he says it this time you can tell he understands that what he's doing is wrong, but he feels like he must do it. \n\nIt shows the middle step between him being a bad person and him being a good person.

The white walkers are in essence zombies and zombie stories are incredibly two dimensional and boring.  It's pretty much fight or flight.

In fact, to this point I'm not sure we've had a single war that has had a positive outcome.  GRRM seems more appreciative of grey situations, grey characters and grey outcomes than D&D, who are more comfortable with hollywood black and white cliches, and I fear GRRM has little influence on the TV show anymore.\n\nI personally hope Cersi has a long reign (she is an interesting character who would do interesting things in power) and hope the WW question is pushed off to season 8.  A nice anti-war twist to Dany's invasion might be to see it fall apart.  The Dothraki might not have enough warm weather clothing and areas to graze their horses.  They like to pillage and rape...this could easily cause internal divisions and rouge Dothrarki causing issues, which would be fun to watch.  That or perhaps many of Dany's forces are killed by wildfire.  \n\nThe other hope is that the white walkers are more complicated then they seem.  They are described as beautiful in the books (but D&D want their ugly villains), and also didn't bother craster so they can reason to some degree.  Perhaps a truce will be negotiated between them.  They will help rebuild the wall (that is likely to fall) and they will be allowed to live north of it, and the humans can only live south of the wall. Bran \"the builder\" could help reconstruct this wall and a nights watch could be re-implemented...but with a twist.  To keep the humans out of the North to keep the peace with the White Walkers.

Yes, I would have fought in WW2 against the Nazis... but the Vietcong were not the Nazis and I didn't think America had any business in Vietnam...\"\n\nThe truth is that ASOIAF isn't just an anti-war story, and that it is highly unlikely that the White Walker threat can be solved by just talking it out in either the show or the books. The truth is that in ASOIAF, just like in real life, some wars are just.", "id": "d6praru"}], [{"comment": "I know you didn't say it...but Harry Potter and Star Wars are about far more than good and evil. Both are a little more complex than they are given credit for here. Jedi/Sith is not Good/Evil. It's all about perspective. Good Wizards and bad wizards...same sort of thing. Though a bit closer to the simplistic good v bad type thing. To suggest either of these is as simplistic as that (more so star wars) is incredibly lazy and belittling. It's easy to hit they grey areas when you have a vast amount of central characters. When you have less, you need to be smarter. \n\n\nAlso, the books are unfinished, but we have what 1 or 2 more seasons left? Certain things SHOULD be at least a little predictable at this stage or we end up with a story thats basically all action with a lot of dick tease with a final episode where Tyrion sits down opens a book and explains to us all of the things that happened, what they mean and why they were secret until the last ep. While there is a build towards a huge war between humanity and white walkers there is still enough to go that this could be resolved in many different ways whilst still focussing on the horrors of war but also we know so little about the white walkers that it's tough to really call them evil. \n\nNot to mention that, i'm sure this ISN'T the metaphor, but lets say the white walkers represent an issue like global warming. This can still fit your anti war vibe, because it points to all the stupid men and women playing wars and the game of thrones and ignoring the bigger threat.Which you could say is accurate of today's world. we fight we argue we throw chairs at each other in parliament and nothing gets done about the real problem.\n\n\np.s if you're a \"global warming is a myth\" type person, please feel free to drop in any other world sized threat.

I feel like having jon face the Night King is to easy but have him teaming up with him seems like a repeat of the wildling thing.

It makes no sense for her to betray the only living known family she has left. It also makes no sense for Jon to betray her because she has been yearning to go back home to Winterfell ever since she has been held hostage at King's Landing. I honestly don't see a logic behind Sansa not trusting Jon and I don't see why the two of them can't pair up and rule the North as a duo, like Tyrion and Dany, or Yara and Theon, or like Littlefinger and Varys (if they weren't enemies).

If only the rulers had been willing to set aside their differences and work together, they might have hoped to stand a chance against the invasion. But they can't. It's every greedy, spiteful ruler for himself. Which will be their doom if the trend continues.\n\nThe white walkers are neither good or evil, but rather a force of nature, much like the harsh winter that will accompany their arrival. They aren't a traditional enemy, but act as a sort of mirror, whose job it is show that the real enemy is within each person.

I'd rather her and Jon be enemies and Westeros falls into a civil war.\n\nTo be honest, I kind of wish someone we really liked was on the Iron Throne at the end of season six. Like someone who would have been a good ruler and then here comes Dany to fuck that up. (Though honestly who would have been left to fill that role? Maybe if Shireen hadn't been killed and the events unfolded that she was put on the throne and now if Dany wants the throne she'd have to kill a little girl... I don't know.

The white walkers are in essence zombies and zombie stories are incredibly two dimensional and boring.  It's pretty much fight or flight.  It's tough to get 15 minutes of interesting screen time out of that let alone an entire season.\n\nI also agree that GOT has been critical of war and leadership, and this viewpoint will change with the upcoming WW war.  In fact, to this point I'm not sure we've had a single war that has had a positive outcome.  GRRM seems more appreciative of grey situations, grey characters and grey outcomes than D&D, who are more comfortable with hollywood black and white cliches, and I fear GRRM has little influence on the TV show anymore.\n\nI personally hope Cersi has a long reign (she is an interesting character who would do interesting things in power) and hope the WW question is pushed off to season 8.  A nice anti-war twist to Dany's invasion might be to see it fall apart.  The Dothraki might not have enough warm weather clothing and areas to graze their horses.  They like to pillage and rape...this could easily cause internal divisions and rouge Dothrarki causing issues, which would be fun to watch.  That or perhaps many of Dany's forces are killed by wildfire.  \n\nThe other hope is that the white walkers are more complicated then they seem.  They are described as beautiful in the books (but D&D want their ugly villains), and also didn't bother craster so they can reason to some degree.  Perhaps a truce will be negotiated between them.  They will help rebuild the wall (that is likely to fall) and they will be allowed to live north of it, and the humans can only live south of the wall. Bran \"the builder\" could help reconstruct this wall and a nights watch could be re-implemented...but with a twist.  To keep the humans out of the North to keep the peace with the White Walkers.

They wanted a dramatic stabbing but didn't want to commit to filler episodes because they sucked at the timing of the storylines and it was inconvenient to have Arya recovering this late in the season (and it'd delay the \"I'm Arya Stark an I'm gonna gtfo\" punch).\n\nAgain, this doesn't necessarily fix the suddenness of it, but I do think that (especially lately) the show has been pretty deliberately leaving large chunks out so that when the next books are released there's plenty of jucier meat even in familiar storylines that are largely being spoiled by the show.

The viewer can no longer watch what happens on the show and wonder what are the future implications of what they just saw; there is no longer any coherency to the narrative.  As a viewer I just can't be engrossed in a story written like this:  The narrative, the plot, everything that happens becomes meaningless and the story is now just whatever D & D want regardless of what has happened or how the characters previously behaved (anyone else notice the characters have become flat in season 6?); nothing matters anymore.

Typically the river water I see has only numbers in the order of a few hundred per 100ml, and sea water less than that. Not all bacteria are pathogenic and may be relatively harmless.\n\nShe was also bleeding heavily, which will wash out the wound and prevent ingress of water."], [12, ">So Lady Crane, who used to physically abuse her boyfriends by stabbing them, apparently has some skill at sewing people back up.

They knew that even if he had the best possible medical care in the Seven Kingdoms like King Robert did, he was gonna die an agonizing death over the next couple days anyway.\n\nIgnoring the weird point about Lady Crane somehow abusing her husbands, who always came back drunk after screwing another woman, which would naturally eventually piss her off to the point of attacking them, Pycelle was deliberately worsening Robert's condition as well, which is why he succumbed to his festering wounds.\n\nWhile Arya was at severe risk of infection from falling in the canal, she did manage to luck out with Lady Crane finding her and then immediately cleaning her injuries and giving her some medicine, before putting her to rest for several days.

Salt is a bacteriostat, so bacteria would not thrive in that environment. \n\n* In the Wiki, it claims that the potable water source is piped into homes. It sounds like they have running water. If anything, that makes it possible that the water in the canals is not sewage. \n\n* Robert was gored by a boar, which lives outside in rather dirty conditions. Boar tusks are also adjacent to the mouth, which could have spread disease (see Biter). In contrast, the Waif's knife, if not poisoned, was likely more clean. In addition, it's far thinner and produces less trauma to the inserted area. It's entirely possible that due to the size of the knife (which was explicitly shown to be thinner than normal knives, compare it to the knife that was stolen from Tyrion in [the first season](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/4/45/Dagger.png/revision/latest?cb=20110625112043). \n\nI think they've shown in many cases that infection is a cause for concern, but not a guaranteed fatality. In fact, your analysis points out that several people had infections that later recovered. And others have pointed out that Talisa, being the other person stabbed in the stomach, was also pregnant which would have exacerbated the wound. She was also stabbed higher and at a different angle, which aligns with several arteries. \n\nPoint being, while the writers missed several great opportunities in the last few episodes, they haven't been inconsistent with the material."], [6, "Fortunately for Arya, the actress she hangs with is also a certified surgeon, and patched up all those wounds nicely without any infection happening. "], [7, "You worked really hard on this but you're missing a huge part of Arya's story. \n\nShe had DAYS to recover. \n\nYou can tell by how empty the bottle of the milk of the poppy is in the scene where Lady Crane dies. \n\nCompare that to the nearly full bottle that is being poured when Lady Crane first gives it to Arya. \n\nSo there's two possibilities there: \n\n1.) Lady Crane and Arya are dope fiends and they are just chugging that milk of the poppy. \n\n\n2.) Arya has been using it for pain management over the course of several days, possibly up to a week. Lady Crane gives her a little to sleep some nights and Arya gets time to rest. \n\n\n\nHoles in the theory:\n\nArya was not ok with taking even one dose of milk of the poppy and only reluctantly did so to heal that one night. Knowing her she might not want to do this for multiple nights. \n\nMaybe Lady Crane used a different bottle. \n\nMaybe the set designers weren't really paying attention and it's just a different fucking bottle. \n\nMaybe the bottle is smaller than we think due to optical illusion or \"movie magic.\"\n\n\nThese are valid points but I still think Arya was healing for longer than we were imagining. \n\nWe also know that out of all the injuries you list Arya had the most shallow injuries due to the length of the waif's knife. It's also very likely the knife was pretty sharp which actually leads to wounds that are easier to heal. A \"clean\" cut of an artery allows the artery to reflexively close itself (it is mostly made of smooth muscle tissue after all). A jagged cut results in greater bleeding. \n\n\nI defer to your main point that the injuries in Game of Thrones are kind of inconsistent and its more likely that the directors just let Arya's plot go this way for the sake of the plot. \n\nThat being said injuries and wound responses are also pretty variable and not perfectly consistent. There's room for error and variation in a lot of ways. I work as an EMT and I am a graduate student in the life sciences so I know a thing or two about the great variation of life and the wounded. We don't know how contaminated the wounds were for Arya, we don't know what kind of medicine the people of Braavos use (but we can assume it's probably better than Westerosi medicine since they are a fairly rich, advanced city state), and we don't know about Lady Crane's actual skill and experience. It's clear she had medical supplies set up ahead of time so she is no stranger to medical treatment. And we know Arya's blood loss was mitigated by the clean rather than jagged stabbing actions. Maybe factor in some Stark resiliency in her and you've got a plausible plot. \n"], [7, "Here's my attempt at a layperson's TLDR.\n\nShow/film universes have an internal logic that becomes more set in stone the deeper into the story we go. Sometimes half the twist is in establishing the internal logic like revealing that dragons really exist at the end of Season 1, or revealing that revival from fatal wounds is possible with Beric Dondarion. That is why Jon Snow's revival was pretty much expected from book readers before the show even started.\n \nBut once that internal logic has been established It makes no sense to go against it because it is illogical even within that universe. This makes the events that follow that illogical event unbelievable in the most literal sense of the word.\n\nOP has pointed out that whilst others have sustained or survived injuries as serious as multiple stab wounds to the gut, their recovery has varied from failure to taking a few months to fully recover. This is what has been established by the show's internal logic.\n\nFor Arya to do what she did right after suffering from an injury as serious as that is illogical within the show's internal logic, which was set up from all the kinds of injuries and rates of recoveries we've seen. If this was a show about assassins and targets who could all recover from stab wounds in days, there would be nothing wrong and unbelievable about Arya's little chase sequence because there is precedence that helps us understand the internal logic. \n\nThe point is that the chase sequence does not follow the show's own established internal logic which is why it felt bad cheesy, not good cheesy."], [6, "Even if Arya is miraculously healed by Maester Crane, it's still shocking how she can drop from a balcony and roll for flights of stairs and still be well enough to kill the Waif and gallivant around Bravoos, presumably with reopened wounds."], [5, "i dont think that witch really helped khal drogo but actually made him worse and lady crane clean and dressed arya's wounds and by the end of arya running she was still bleeding so she might die still"], [5, "People in real life have survived worse stab wounds than arya's wounds.

Not only that, but she was being hunted by another T-1000 and killed that one! \n\nI believe the whole point of Lady Crane being experienced with treating wounds is to show that she can effectively (at least more so than the average person) clean and treat a stab wound. Why else would they have included that dialogue? Stretch on infection? Maybe... but people have lived through much, much, much worse and lived to tell the tale- in real  life and in this series.\n\nThis whole set of events was to lay out that Arya has moved past pain and fear.

Lady Crane and Arya are dope fiends and they are just chugging that milk of the poppy. \n\n\n2.) Arya has been using it for pain management over the course of several days, possibly up to a week.

I understand that he's seen her do crazy stuff before but it still seems like a bit of a jump.

He wants to inherit the North; he can't do that with Roose and his brother around. \n\nI don't think Davos has seen the Wights and Whitewalkers, so I don't think *that's* a good character motivation for him. Even then, why would he want to resurrect anyone to begin with? There isn't really any urgency for Jon to be brought back from Davos's point of view.

Surely there will be more cases in which other good people die and deserve resurrection - as Melisandre did it as a favor to Davos more so than in the service of the Lord of Light.

They could have thrown in Lady Crane somewhere and still managed to make it seem less shoddy than it did as is.

I am not convinced that she has learnt what she could have while training with the Waif.      \n\nThey also casually mentioned that we don't know what is east of Essos and if it circles back to Westeros. I was wondering if Arya will seriously take up exploration.. and i was mildly impressed because I didn't think this aspect was going to come up.

They live by their code but are pro at subterfuge and fighting. And then he tells Arya she is no one??? She killed someone violently, not because she was contracted to kill but out of self defense (sort of). It wasn't a smooth operation. She led a bloody trail - probably all the way to the House of B&W and skinned Waif's face and left blood all over the House. We haven't seen anything like that in the House so far.

But the way they did it, this entire sequence could have been done the first time the Waif found her! They could have thrown in Lady Crane somewhere and still managed to make it seem less shoddy than it did as is. After TWO+ years of training in various skills, the only thing they show the viewers about Arya is her floundering and half-assed planning. Then they finally show Arya in control for a split second before cutting the lights and letting you assume she won. This doesn't help build her character at all. I am not convinced that she has learnt what she could have while training with the Waif.      \n\nThey also casually mentioned that we don't know what is east of Essos and if it circles back to Westeros. I was wondering if Arya will seriously take up exploration.. and i was mildly impressed because I didn't think this aspect was going to come up. But then all that is for naught because the Faceless Men storyline ends in that awful dialogue with Sexy Jesus.     \n\nAbout that dialogue with Sexy Jesus: His character made the Faceless Men seem very mysterious but kinda badass. They live by their code but are pro at subterfuge and fighting. And then he tells Arya she is no one??? She killed someone violently, not because she was contracted to kill but out of self defense (sort of). It wasn't a smooth operation. She led a bloody trail - probably all the way to the House of B&W and skinned Waif's face and left blood all over the House. We haven't seen anything like that in the House so far. So what makes her apprenticeship seem complete\"???? Why would he have that proud look on his face???      \n\n\nWhew. I can now sleep in peace since i've gotten this off my chest.

Bran and his party come upon the large Heart Tree from his visions, but as they arrive they are attacked by wights; though Jojen is killed, Bran, Hodor and Meera are saved by a child of the forest who takes them to the three-eyed raven. In Meereen, Daenerys responds to a former slave's wish of being sold into slavery again by allowing him to contract his labor to his former master on a yearly basis. The next citizen brings her the charred remains of his daughter who was burned by Drogon. As a precaution, Daenerys chains her other dragons in the catacombs. In the Vale, Brienne and Podrick come across Arya and the Hound. Brienne mortally wounds the Hound, while Arya escapes. Meanwhile in King's Landing, Cersei orders Qyburn to do anything to save the Mountain, she confronts her father, threatening to reveal her and Jaime's incestuous affairs if she is forced to marry Loras. Tyrion is released from his cell by Jaime, but he later finds Shae in Tywin's bed and kills her. He then confronts his father in the privy and shoots him with Joffrey's crossbow, before escaping the city with Varys. The season ends with Arya buying passage on a ship bound for Braavos with the coin Jaqen H'ghar gave her.\n\nEvery one of these storylines begins with a problem, has a period of tension where you're not sure how it's going to be resolved and then has a satisfying resolution that moves the story forward.\n\nIs Mance going to kill Jon Snow? Will Bran make it to the heart tree? How will Daenerys respond to difficult executive decisions? Can Brienne and the Hound meet each other without disaster? How will Tywin react when Cersei puts him in a corner? Will Tyrion make it out of King's Landing alive? Can a simple coin really buy Arya a trip home?\n\nCompare this to the most recent episode. Will Jon Snow execute the traitors?Yes, of course he will. How will Gilly react when Sam says she's going to Horn Hill? She's understanding. Will Ned and Howland survive their encounter with Ser Arthur Dayne? Yes, we know they survive. What will Daenerys do when she joins the Dosh Khaleen? Nothing.\n\nThere are some scenes that really do have tension in the last episode. Tommen and the High Sparrow. The small council meeting. Arya drinking the suicide water. Lord Umber refusing to bend the knee.\n\nThe interrogation scene with Varys is quite interesting because you can feel the tension rise and fall repeatedly as he threatens her and then takes the threat back, sucking the tension away again.\n", "id": "d35ujio"}, {"comment": "Now I see what you mean.

If you're experiencing catharsis that's a hint that there is tension in the story, and you're at the end of a mini-story where we see how the characters have changed.\n\nMaybe I'm thinking of tension more broadly than you are. [Dramatic tension](http://www.thewritersalleyblog.com/2012/05/four-types-of-dramatic-tension-part-one.html) [\\[2\\]](http://www.thewritersalleyblog.com/2012/05/four-types-of-dramatic-tension-part-two.html) doesn't just refer to potentially violent situations, it refers to any situation where a question is left unresolved, especially a character's goal.\n\nI haven't read the books but it seems to me a character trying to quell a rebellion creates considerable dramatic tension because they're trying to achieve a difficult goal they are very invested in. It may not work, so the reader is in suspense and has to read on.\n\nThe format of a TV show places particular demands on an writer than aren't the same for a novel. A reader can put down a novel at any moment, may read many chapters in one sitting and usually doesn't put down the novel for more than a couple of days (or if they do they may re-read to remind themselves where they're up to). On the other hand, most TV viewers will watch one episode at a time with a week-long gap between episodes.\n\nThis week-long gap spoils the dramatic tension. If you don't complete a mini-story within an episode the viewer is left hanging and unsatisfied and the resolution will typically have less impact when it finally comes \u2014 the viewer has lost some memory of the stakes involved.\n\nI hasten to add that there will always been larger plot arcs happening that do get resolved over several episodes. These work by having the stakes reinforced over and over again, through a series of mini-stories that are building to a climax.\n\nFinally, you say you love learning about the history, lore and characters. All of these things can be sources of dramatic tension. A detailed, immersive fantasy world is a source of mystery. The reader is drawn in because incomplete explanations are given, with big questions outstanding.

While statistics vary wildly, there's little doubt that tens of millions of people in the US alone have been raped.

It had a lot to do with how it was shot, and how they focused on Theon's face."], [9, "Some critics argued that it was gratuitous, but it seemed pretty inline with Ramsey's character. "], [8, "I'll play the devil's advocate here.\n\n1. **(Referring to that particular scene)** There are plenty of reasons why people hated that scene, but I think most of it revolves around Sansa, since not only is she in a different storyline in the books, she's also suffered so much up to that point. While we've seen just how far her character has developed now, back then people thought it was just another storyline involving her being victimized by another psychopath again for the sake of shock value. Or at least from what I gathered as to their reasoning.\n\n2. **(Referring to media portrayal of rape in general)** I also think it's a matter of sexual assault being a much more common problem for women to deal with in the everyday world. Rape is still a very relevant difficulty to discuss, as opposed presumably less common acts of brutality such as castration. As a result, if a rape is shown on/off-screen, you're much more likely to have women getting uncomfortable because it can realistically happen to them. Then again, violent assaults are also common, but as someone mentioned earlier, rape has the potential to be more psychologically destructive, as well as our culture's portrayal of violence versus sex being very different.\n\nWith that said, I do strongly agree with Martin's view that rape does portray reality, and that getting rid of it in his universe would be dishonest. However, it's always going to be tricky dealing this subject matter, so no matter what you do, there's at least someone who's going to make an uproar about this."], [10, ">Can someone explain why having rape in a TV show is such a damnable offense?\n\nThe damnable offense is not depicting rape, but depicting rape badly. For example, having a graphic rape scene without dedicating any attention to the way it impacts the victim's life, or to the way the previous interactions (if any) between victim and rapist lead up to it, -- basically doing it for the shock value, or for the \"grim and mature\" cred, but not handling the subject with due care. Was Sansa's rape depicted badly, by this standard? No, but it followed a lot of rapes that were depicted super sloppily - such as Daenerys's in S1 (her husband raped her a bunch of times, but then she learned to fuck properly and they fell in love and lived happily ~~ever after~~ for a while), and Cersei's in S4 (\"we meant to do a sex scene but accidentally did a rape scene so let's act like it never happened\" -- the showrunners). Or, for that matter, Gilly's close call in S~~6~~5 which happened later so it doesn't count for our purposes, but it was bad. By the time the Black Wedding happened, people were already used to groaning at that shit, and there was an especially beloved character at stake this time, so some people were quick to judge.\n\nThe showrunners actually did a better job with the aftermath of Sansa's rape and Cersei's walk of atonement (not a rape, but also a sexual trauma so relevant to our interest here), but by the time it happened people had already put the show in the \"depicts rape badly for shock value\" column.\n\n>There was a ridiculous amount of criticism that, since the writer's included rape, they most obviously condone rape.\n\n~~FTFY. It sucks when similar words mean opposite things, but that's English.~~ Misread OP's sentence, disregard.\n\nETA:\n\n> and the show portrayed the rapist as a horrible human being\n\nTo continue from my previous point: appearing to condone it is one way to fuck up a depiction of rape, but it isn't the only one."], [4, "I agree that it mostly a vocal minority.  Personally, I think there are a lot of tv shows out there that exploit low hanging fruit, and use shocking and graphic scenes to disguise poor material.  I don't think game of thrones is one of those shows.

If that culture is really passive about rape - she deserved it, oh it's not that bad, rapists get low sentences, all that - there is no denying that something so famous has a massive impact in its portrayals. When it just copies most other awful ways rape is depicted it helps normalise how we treat the subject, which is incredibly harmful to how victims of rape are treated by society.\n\nOn top of that it was piss poor writing tbh"], [5, "Contains book spoiler! Sorry I tried adding a tag but I can't seem to get it right :/\n\nWell, at least for me, here's what I feel. Prior to Sansa's rape plot, the writers of the TV show has chosen to omit/add/merge original storylines from the book. Some of these omissions/additions/mergers, I feel, are hurting the overall story, and also take away/substract a lot of personalities from some of the show's main characters.\n\n\nThe major ones are:\n\n[Book Spoiler](#b \"1. The omission of Tysha as the main reason of why Tyrion killed Tywin.\n\n2. The Sand Snakes arc that takes just so much away from the book's original plot involving how Doran actually has a \"revenge\" plan against the Lannisters.\n\n\nAnd Sansa's deviating arc involving how she's being raped by Ramsey was just like the cherry on top. Just as I don't understand how hard would it be for the writer to devote a five- or ten-minute slot to quickly recap back to Tysha (and omit the awfully boring conversation between Tyrion and Jamie about their bug-squashing cousin), I also don't understand the writers decision not to follow the original plot of Jeyne Pool instead of Sansa marrying Ramsey. The writers have argued that they lack the airtime to do that, but considering the original book plot involves Sansa and Petyr staying put in Eyre after Lysa's death, that would free up a lot of time that can be used to introduce Jeyne Pool.\")"], [3, "Simple answer: It's fictional, and so everything they show us is for a reason. \n\nWhen they choose to write, spend money on, act, and shoot a scene we must ask, why did they do that? What was the reason they showed us that? Is that reason to further the plot? Is it to advance the arc of a character? Is is for spectacle? Is it to titillate? \n\nThe whole argument about this being a world where X happens is invalid. People likely sit quietly and eat in this world or say nothing at all for 15 minutes at a time and repair their wagons, but they don't show that to us because it doesn't have any narrative purpose. Whatever they show us is a choice, and some people believed the choice to show Sansa being raped served no narrative purpose that couldn't have been handled in another way that wouldn't have forced us, the audience, to watch it.

After seeing almost every female character experience gender based violence, for example Cercei being raped with no consequences, I think people were just a bit worn down. \n\nIn the end it comes down to how rape is presented on screen. It is a very common occurrence in real life, and is often used in warfare so I'm certainly not arguing that rape should not be shown on TV, and I don't think the people who complained are arguing that. However, when every central female character is raped, when female characters only become strong as a response to sexual violence, you start to realise that there is a problem with the way these women are being written.

Secondly, it's a bullshit argument. Plenty of horrific events on the show have happened to serve the storylines of the ones committing them, while the victim is reduced to just that. When Joffery abuses Ros, the focus is on him. Every nameless victim killed in battle by a major character serves no purpose other than dying at the behest of somebody else. I understand the common argument that depicting the rape of a beloved and innocent character can trigger very unwanted memories from people watching the show more than other depicted forms of violence would, but that doesn't require a special set of rules to be written for when a show based around violence happening to anyone at any time for any reason can show that one specific form.", "id": "d4nrkty"}, {"comment": "But Sansa already went through dark, torturous circumstances in King's Landing. My reasons for being offended were because, firstly, it was a reset from Sansa's apparent rescue from KL and what seemed during Season 4 to be a new start for her. It seemed like she was being set up for growth. She was going under the wing of Petyr Baelish: Master of Deception. Whether or not that was what we were going to get is obviously irrelevant since we shouldn't \"expect\" any one story direction, especially with this show. However, with that set-up we should *at least* expect no character arc reversal or any instance of the show undercutting its own character evolution set-up. When Sansa became Ramsay's, it was like all her previous pain became irrelevant compared to an even worse pain. It shifted our empathetic anger from the people who she was never able to get revenge on, to ONE person so blatantly evil that it was boring AND shocking. In Game of Thrones' best moments, it gives us no one person to blame for shitty things. With Ned's death, conspirators put Joffrey in that position. With the Red Wedding, Rob and Cat brought it on themselves. Same with Theon's torture. With Sansa, D&D had Littlefinger act out of character to put her in that situation (which gave us reason to think he may save her before that happened) but in the end, it's all Ramsay's decision to commit the rape. But he's not only a psychopath, he's a \"master tactician\"? He fights off the Greyjoys and Stannis' army? At that point he's simply Satan. That's not complex.    \n    \nSecondly, it was a personal thing having read the first two books where she begins even more drastically underage. You watch a preteen suffer and see, through the show, that there may be hope after a certain specific point, only with the revelation that they'll have to suffer a little while longer.

However, that's just a theme in the show. Sound storytelling and payoff are important, as are continuing and not botching character arcs. Sansa went through hell already. It's inefficient in a storytelling sense to put her through more harm immediately, especially after where she was left in Season 4. You watch the conclusion to her Season 4 story and the editing, camerawork, costuming and most importantly the score and direction, hint towards her looking toward greater things to come. Rewatching that scene, it's setting up something that doesn't happen; making a promise that it doesn't fulfill.

While we've seen just how far her character has developed now, back then people thought it was just another storyline involving her being victimized by another psychopath again for the sake of shock value. Or at least from what I gathered as to their reasoning.\n\n2. **(Referring to media portrayal of rape in general)** I also think it's a matter of sexual assault being a much more common problem for women to deal with in the everyday world. Rape is still a very relevant difficulty to discuss, as opposed presumably less common acts of brutality such as castration. As a result, if a rape is shown on/off-screen, you're much more likely to have women getting uncomfortable because it can realistically happen to them. Then again, violent assaults are also common, but as someone mentioned earlier, rape has the potential to be more psychologically destructive, as well as our culture's portrayal of violence versus sex being very different.\n\nWith that said, I do strongly agree with Martin's view that rape does portray reality, and that getting rid of it in his universe would be dishonest.

Was Sansa's rape depicted badly, by this standard? No, but it followed a lot of rapes that were depicted super sloppily - such as Daenerys's in S1 (her husband raped her a bunch of times, but then she learned to fuck properly and they fell in love and lived happily ~~ever after~~ for a while), and Cersei's in S4 (\"we meant to do a sex scene but accidentally did a rape scene so let's act like it never happened\" -- the showrunners). Or, for that matter, Gilly's close call in S~~6~~5 which happened later so it doesn't count for our purposes, but it was bad. By the time the Black Wedding happened, people were already used to groaning at that shit, and there was an especially beloved character at stake this time, so some people were quick to judge.\n\nThe showrunners actually did a better job with the aftermath of Sansa's rape and Cersei's walk of atonement (not a rape, but also a sexual trauma so relevant to our interest here), but by the time it happened people had already put the show in the \"depicts rape badly for shock value\" column.\n\n>There was a ridiculous amount of criticism that, since the writer's included rape, they most obviously condone rape.\n\n~~FTFY.

But when its *someone else* penetrating you (anally for guys), when you are the one ending up with bruises and shit *inside* out you, and you are the one dealing with the victim blaming culture, guys can empathize much more.\n\nDepictions of death etc. don't affect people as much because after you die, you die. With rape you have to live with it for the rest of your life, there isn't any reset or rewind button.\n \nImagine if guys getting their dicks cut off was a much bigger phenomenon than it is in the real world. People would be angry about the Theon scenes too (which they already were) because they'd be genuinely worried about all the victims of dick-castration.

After seeing almost every female character experience gender based violence, for example Cercei being raped with no consequences, I think people were just a bit worn down. \n\nIn the end it comes down to how rape is presented on screen. It is a very common occurrence in real life, and is often used in warfare so I'm certainly not arguing that rape should not be shown on TV, and I don't think the people who complained are arguing that. However, when every central female character is raped, when female characters only become strong as a response to sexual violence, you start to realise that there is a problem with the way these women are being written. It's not truthful, rape happens, but there are other plots to explore for women. Women don't need to be raped, beaten and abused to be strong, they can just be strong.

In some respects, you are correct. There are times when the show uses a sledgehammer to deliver a plot point. \n\nExamples of some of the more ham-handed scenes:\n\n1. As you pointed out, referring to Ser Robert Strong as \"Gregor\". \n\n2. Jamie's multiple references to his children when speaking with Cersei, i.e. explicitly stating that Cersei's kids are also his kids.\n\n3. Lysa Arryn revealing Petyr's plot to poison her husband by narrating it back to Petyr.\n\n4. The Sand Snakes. If ever you need ammunition to defend your point that the show lacks subtlety, look no further. \n\nOn the other hand, there are other examples of extreme subtlety in the show.\n\n1. Mel's necklace. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4hiwd7/spoilers_everything_potentially_important_point/) for more information, but keep in mind that OP has barely revealed the tip of an iceberg. Read through the comments and find some other posts. That necklace is an amazing testament to subtlety. \n\n2. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4i51g5/everything_cerseis_costume_journey_from_season_1/) digs into the symbolism surrounding the costumes and settings in GoT. In the course of looking through these photos, you might find yourself totally re-evaluating the subtlety in the show. You'll see that an amazing amount of thought has been put into the visual clues that viewers are given on the show - which is especially relevant to this particular situation, since the wolf's head is a visual clue. \n\n3. Foreshadowing, foreshadowing, foreshadowing. Season 1, Petyr uses a dagger as a prop during a conversation with Ned. *...Who do they follow? <spins a dagger around> The man who pays them.* Season 2, Lord Karstark hints that Rob will lose. *I think you lost this war the day you married her*. Seasons 3-5, everything about Stannis. After Season 2, he is basically a non-factor in the War of Five Kings. And yet, simply for the fact that the show followed his story, people were lining up to follow \"Stannis the Mannis\". We find out, though, that Stannis wasn't really all that important. His story was actually Mel's story - but most viewers didn't realize it until this week.\n\nA fair assessment, therefore, would be that the show does some things very well but it has moments of really, really bad script re-writes. My guess is that the original script doesn't include these lines. The team reviews the script and discusses whether or not the audience needs a slap in the face to remind them of a past event.

In some respects, you are correct. There are times when the show uses a sledgehammer to deliver a plot point. \n\nExamples of some of the more ham-handed scenes:\n\n1. As you pointed out, referring to Ser Robert Strong as \"Gregor\". \n\n2. Jamie's multiple references to his children when speaking with Cersei, i.e. explicitly stating that Cersei's kids are also his kids.\n\n3. Lysa Arryn revealing Petyr's plot to poison her husband by narrating it back to Petyr.\n\n4. The Sand Snakes. If ever you need ammunition to defend your point that the show lacks subtlety, look no further. \n\nOn the other hand, there are other examples of extreme subtlety in the show.\n\n1. Mel's necklace. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4hiwd7/spoilers_everything_potentially_important_point/) for more information, but keep in mind that OP has barely revealed the tip of an iceberg. Read through the comments and find some other posts. That necklace is an amazing testament to subtlety. \n\n2. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4i51g5/everything_cerseis_costume_journey_from_season_1/) digs into the symbolism surrounding the costumes and settings in GoT. In the course of looking through these photos, you might find yourself totally re-evaluating the subtlety in the show. You'll see that an amazing amount of thought has been put into the visual clues that viewers are given on the show - which is especially relevant to this particular situation, since the wolf's head is a visual clue. \n\n3. Foreshadowing, foreshadowing, foreshadowing. Season 1, Petyr uses a dagger as a prop during a conversation with Ned. *...Who do they follow? <spins a dagger around> The man who pays them.* Season 2, Lord Karstark hints that Rob will lose. *I think you lost this war the day you married her*. Seasons 3-5, everything about Stannis. After Season 2, he is basically a non-factor in the War of Five Kings. And yet, simply for the fact that the show followed his story, people were lining up to follow \"Stannis the Mannis\". We find out, though, that Stannis wasn't really all that important. His story was actually Mel's story - but most viewers didn't realize it until this week.\n\nA fair assessment, therefore, would be that the show does some things very well but it has moments of really, really bad script re-writes. My guess is that the original script doesn't include these lines. The team reviews the script and discusses whether or not the audience needs a slap in the face to remind them of a past event.

For me it's part of the beauty of this show is that you almost need to watch each season twice.\n\nI don't think it's that far fetched to think the Umbers could have a plan to betray the Boltons.

I think we are all going to be disappointed if/when Ramsay has his way with Rickon or Osha and we have to watch more of that sadistic monster's rampage continue. Sure it is wishful thinking but I feel like the way Umber carried himself in the exchange was telling, he was never once about to consider bending the knee to the Boltons and that says a lot about a house that prides itself on loyalty and honoring an oath. It was obvious that Umber knew Ramsay killed his own father whether he admitted it or not and nobody in their right mind is going to trust a man who just murdered his own family to protect his claim to the throne.

I have often wondered since like season 3ish if the directors regret casting her due to her lack of acting skill compared to several other notable main actors/actresses and then her refusal to do nude scenes until last night which was an amazing scene and I'm sure the only reason she agreed to it was by fan request after the awkward bed scene with Darrio and going for a repeat reaction of the pyre and birth of her dragons, I thought the fire spread slow enough but fast enough and she finally handled a problem on her own, no dragons, no armed guards, just 1.5 aides, yes Jorah is a .5 now, the old man, I imagine Darrio knocked the men out and Jorah looked at his arm some more. I gained respect for Danny last night but she's got a long way to go to reach some of the personal potentials many other characters have in GoT style situations. Yes, she started out with nothing but has had everything since handed to her much more than she had to earn it and she hasn't had any devastating events in her plot yet, like the loss of a body part, or being murdered, or a psycho's pet, or on a journey pushing her every limit. She sits there, behind dragons and unsullied and good advisors and usually only displays one emotion while talking, that serious determined confident tone that she just barely can't sell to the audience unless you're in lust over her unparalleled beauty. Most of her success is very well scripted, dozens of possible bad outcomes and she comes out good. Like last night, 999 out of 1000 people wouldn't have tried that because she would be killed not followed but without any context of what happened in the hut, only knowing she walked out of fire, they all bow to her instead of slaying someone who doesn't follow the Dothraki way and killed their leaders. Also think of how she would do if she walked into a King's Landing small council meeting, she does not obtain the intelligence necessary to contend with any of the 'players' in a Game of Thrones yet she has dreams of breaking the wheel and blah blah.

She was given to a husband.  Now compared to modern times that's basically slavery, but look at the actual slaves in the show and tell me that she was in that position.

Good thing her plot armor is unimaginably thick and she not only lives, but hatches THREE DRAGONS and she ends up with all her people still following her.  They didn't follow her because of who she is, they followed her because scary magic let her survive fire and she has dragons.  They follow strength and hers was based solely around magic DNA and dragons.\n\nThe one thing she did for herself was to gain the unsullied.  She made a great deal with the slave master where she gets everything and they get nothing, this is probably her only strength she's ever showed.  All the cities she conquers is done by other people.  She sits in a tent and her generals come running in to congratulate her on her \"victory\".  She does a shit job ruling and ultimately just randomly chooses who to listen to.

I hate her because the story frames her as this character that's strong enough to beat all odds and frames her as one of the main characters, but she just feels empty.  I don't like Sansa either but she's been betrothed three times now.

In Season 1, she actually walks **into** the flames. She doesn't rise until the next morning.\n\n The impact is entirely different when all you do is appear to walk out of the flames of a burning building at night. It's entirely different when you aren't holding 3 baby dragons. Drogon's appearance would have reminded the Dothraki that her title - *Mother of Dragons* - was well-earned, that her power is greater than the combined power of the horde.

First, her story arc in season 5 leading to season 6 not only made sense, but also left us in an impeccable crossroads for how she would develop as a character.  Furthermore, the beginning of season 6 gave Arya an incredible opportunity to face her own inner struggle for vengeance through experiencing the play and interacting with Lady Crane.  What frustrates me is the last 2 episodes.  We saw her choose honor and justice over mindless killing, showing a definite conclusion in her arc from the beginning of season 5.  Moreover, we were also convinced through multiple training scenes that she had acquired some sort of fighting skill.  The events that took place in S6 Epi 7 show a complete 180 in what we the audience believe Arya would do.  I think that scene, with her being stabbed on the bridge, is what created this gap in clear coherent story telling.  It was not only out of character, but also contrary to what we saw at the end of S6 Epi 6, where it seemed she was preparing to defend herself.  The conclusion was justified and made sense for her character,  but how we got their was poorly told.

Both Blackfish and Waif got an off-screen deaths, and Jaime appears to be not even close to his redemption arc, so expect an off-screen death for him too.

Season 1 through 4 were fucking great. But last two seasons, seem like a drag. They are cutting corners on small character developments and more up and close, personal, smaller fights - just to get us Hardhome and Bastardbowl?\n\nHell, maybe you are right.

Its like if someone you know spent years in their garage building something mysterious. You see sawdust and all these tools and they go on about how excited they are to show you, and then one day they finally show you and it is a cutting board. It is just incredibly underwhelming.\n\nIn addition to the under delivering of it, these last two episodes has made Arya look like a clumsy idiot. She has been training with these people whose whole schtick is that they are disguised as other people and she doesn't constantly doubt every one she passes on the road? She knows they are after her.

First, her story arc in season 5 leading to season 6 not only made sense, but also left us in an impeccable crossroads for how she would develop as a character.  Furthermore, the beginning of season 6 gave Arya an incredible opportunity to face her own inner struggle for vengeance through experiencing the play and interacting with Lady Crane.  What frustrates me is the last 2 episodes.  We saw her choose honor and justice over mindless killing, showing a definite conclusion in her arc from the beginning of season 5.  Moreover, we were also convinced through multiple training scenes that she had acquired some sort of fighting skill.  The events that took place in S6 Epi 7 show a complete 180 in what we the audience believe Arya would do.  I think that scene, with her being stabbed on the bridge, is what created this gap in clear coherent story telling.  It was not only out of character, but also contrary to what we saw at the end of S6 Epi 6, where it seemed she was preparing to defend herself.  The conclusion was justified and made sense for her character,  but how we got their was poorly told.  Also it muddles the audiences ability to understand that she has received training that would help legitimize the time she spent with the faceless men.  \nTL:DR- The Arya story line was spoiled by the events in S6 episode 7 (bridge scene) because it contradicts what we learned about Arya.

Both Blackfish and Waif got an off-screen deaths, and Jaime appears to be not even close to his redemption arc, so expect an off-screen death for him too.

They are simplified down to their core. \n\nArya scenes are somewhat alright, and chase scenes are fine - but once again, the show does not allocate its resources well.

Running backwards you're also going the same direction as the arrows so they have a much larger window of opportunity to hit a part of you.

Whether she knew they were coming for sure or not makes no matter.  People keeping saying 2 things, she didn't know they were coming for sure and keeping it a secret was the best strategy for HER survival and to make sure they took winterfell.  Okay so since its pretty accepted she didn't know they were coming, what happens if they show up a day earlier?  Good job Sansa there goes the surprise, we could've sent a couple riders to meet them.  Ramsey sees the vale and probably just waits out a siege.  Lets say they come a day later than they did, hell even a couple hours later.  Jons whole army is gone and again Ramsey likely takes the good chunk of his forces that would still remain and waits out a siege.\n\nYou can't use the end result to justify a silly decision.  The only way it was a good strategic move was if she knew exactly when they were coming (which she didn't) and even so there was still no harm in telling Jon.

Meereen,  how fucking useless did the Unsullied become in Season 5?  to the point where these elite trained soldiers could be slaughtered en masse by aristocrats with daggers...  the whole Sons of the Harpy thing felt extremely contrived nearly every time they appeared,  for an underground movement, their lack of subtlety was astonishing, and it made them out to be a much bigger immediate threat than they should have been, also resulting in another fairly needless death for Barristan Selmy\")\n\n[S05](#s \"5. the rushed onset of power for the High Sparrow.

This led to a season that was simultaneously slowly-paced due to the immense amount of setup required and material to cover, and yet seemingly rushed because of all the condensing of material required to fit two books into ten hours of television. \n\nIn addition, there was no major battle or shocking tragedy in Books 4 and 5, with the exception of [S5E10](#s \"Jon's death, which really had to be a season-ending cliffhanger.\") As such, they had to invent a battle specifically for the show- [S5E8](#s \"Hardhome\")- which was thankfully successful, and move up a shocking tragedy from its presumably later point in the books- [S5E9](#s \"Stannis burning Shireen\")- which received less positive audience reactions (though I personally liked it).\n\nIt also took some of the biggest leaps from the source material, specifically in Sansa's storyline, and in the widely-reviled Dorne arc. Personally, I think Sansa's story was well done and a necessary change for a television adaptation, but I can't really defend the choices they made when adapting the (admittedly difficult to adapt) Dornish arc.\n\nAll in all, it was probably the slowest and spottiest season, but to the writers' credit, it was the most difficult material to adapt.

Ignoring the question mark they created is a bit like stumbling into the first half of a magic trick without knowing how it ends.

One side's hero is another's villain seems to be a recurring theme in ASOIAF and got and daenerys symbolizes this perfectly.

Think about it like this, she is willing to let thousands die so she can be queen of westeros.

Her army is made up of dothraki, know for raping, pillaging, and burning entire civilizations, not the most heroic army is it? The fact that you may not like her is the point. She isn't an outlandish or vile villain like joffrey, she's a somewhat likeable but often narcissistic and selfish PERSON, not a monster. It's the beauty of such a story that the true villain wouldn't be a bunch of zombies or a despicable person, but instead just someone who can be both loved and disliked depending upon who you ask. One side's hero is another's villain seems to be a recurring theme in ASOIAF and got and daenerys symbolizes this perfectly. She's not a perfect person and can often be despised for some of her actions but she can also be seen as a relatable, loveable, and redeemable character depending upon whom you ask.

It could represent the fall of man (or the current way of ruling/power structures) and the coming of winter, or speak literally to the fate of the KL, we don't really know. If we take it literally, at some point in time the throne room is destroyed/abandoned and there is a freezing winter. Those things may or may not be linked to a single event, since we don't know when the destruction happened in relation to when winter arrived. It is possible that that situation is the culmination of both man's destruction (via Mad Queen or otherwise) as well as the walkers eventually triumphing over humanity, and that one may lead to the other. \n\nOne thing that has struck me from the beginning of the show, and actually made it kind of hard for me to get invested when I tried the first time, is how most of the characters seem to be playing a live action game of RISK (\"the game of thrones\") while there's a much bigger picture that they are ignoring (dragons, white walkers -- the fantasy elements that originally interested me, and make the stakes much larger than the political drama playing out in S1). Only now are these issues really coming to light for more of the world, and for all their squabbling and power grabbing, mankind may realize this too late -- to their utter destruction. The only way that man would legit be able to stand against these magical forces in an actual battle is united, and they are anything but. This is not to say that a physical war is the only way to settle this situation (and I kind of doubt it will be), but if one were to occur, man is at an automatic disadvantage due to their fallen immediately buffing the other side. The only thing that can balance this would be the dragons due to the wights' susceptibility to fire, which is why Dany is such a major player and perhaps why she was given the vision (though by whom? I wish there had been more explanation of her experience, but I guess that's what the books are for). In that sense it may be a warning of the future for mankind should Dany fail to unite man behind her and her dragons against the coming of winter/the others.\n\n", "id": "d45jjza"}], [{"comment": "I like this too.

I'm not shitting on Benihoff or Weiss exclusively considering others have written episodes too (Cogman, Hill), but the Arya story arch has been unacceptably pointless; even the most amateur of writers can point to a number of cringe-worthy mistakes made since she arrived in Bravos.\n\n> Arya clearly just got a false sense of security and made a genuine mistake, it is not bad writing whatsoever, and is a lot more plausible than Jaquen risking his life to give Arya a 3rd chance, which he specifically said he wouldn't do\n\nPutting aside my total disagreement with this assessment, I think the major issue is bigger than this. One of the key reasons why so many layered theories were flying around - some plausible, others less so - was indicative of the audience's reluctance to believe that her storyline could be so linear. Part of this is due to our high standards; GOT has often produced high caliber writing that, among other things, butters its bread with character development. So in this instance, when we see Arya making a seemingly careless mistake, we as an audience want this to segway into a final product that validates her time at the House of the Undying. Did an alternate persona, Arya Stark, get stabbed while the true Arya, the waif, wielded the knife? Did Arya anticipate the attack and feign her death in order to take revenge on the THOBW? Is there something, *anything*, that we as an audience haven't connected that can make these seemingly meaningless sequences come together in a way that impacts her character significantly enough that we can be comfortable with her having spent 3 seasons in Bravos? \n\nTo me, the answer is more or less no. Sure, you'll have some who will point to how she has matured, has learned she is not hellbent on revenge anymore (are people sure about that? doesn't seem like someone who reconfirms her identity as a Stark would just forget past transgressions against her) but the truth is, Bravos fell flat. Whether this is because GRRM didn't provide much guidance in terms of his notes for TWOW and beyond, or because Benihoff and Weiss simply went their own route will be interesting to find out.

I think the blood smearing was intentional because she was trying to lead the waif back to where she hid Needle, but she did look like her injuries were getting to her so I don't know how she had the energy to kill the waif. I didn't even have a preferred theory about how Arya's story was going to end so I'm not mad that my theory was false or whatever. \n\nAlso, we spent all this time on the Faceless Men, but I still don't understand them and I don't understand what it means to be No One. Why did Jaqen accept her? The waif disobeyed his \"don't make her suffer\" order and clearly made her work with Arya personal, so I guess that explains why Jaqen wasn't particularly upset by the loss, but why does he accept Arya as No One? Does being No One just mean being able to kill any one? I think it was powerful to show that Arya Stark of Winterfell survived almost two seasons trying to forget who she was and having her identity beaten out of her and now she's ready to go home and presumably help whatever is left of her family, but I'm still not clear on why Jaqen accepts this.

Jaime is a character we suspect to redeem himself. He's tried to redeem himself and in the books he's more actively seeking a better path. In the show however...? Currently he's in this wonky position where he's half redemption, half \"CERSEI IZ BEST GURL UGUUUU\" and the moment he's doing something honorable, it's immediately followed by something stupid or vice versa. Dude, wtf just commit to a direction with him. You can *feel* the writers trying to drag out character development for him as long as possible.

But theres no defending the idiotic arya storyline this episode. \n\nShe was sliced across the lower abdomen with a knife that looked at the most conservative estimate a good 3 inches then stabbed a further 3 times, then fell into a canal that would be teeming with sewage, excrement and disease. she then managed to walk for who knows how long, without passing out or dying from blood loss. then, some theatre actor suddenly has extensive surgical experience and tools and \"fixes her up\" in all of a day, and several days later shes back on her feet running full speed and it takes a collosal fall to even open her wounds. Any person undergoing that would be wrought with infection and fever, would have barely even begun the healing process from the wounds or even the trauma of surgery, and frankly, would be dead from blood loss anyway because blood transfusions obviously werent an option. Its a prime example of a dreadful lack of realism to allow for drama and \"ooh look how strong our main character is\" \n\nSecondly, they ruined the house of black and white for me (gradually over the last 3 seasons but here more than ever). The line \"A girl is finally no one\" is the worst line written for television since \"but you want the bad pussy\" jaquen (or, correctly \"no one\") is a faceless man, this petty conflict between two angry girls should be completely irrelevant to him. Its two initiates that have failed their training and thats it. but instead we get this ridiculous scene where arya gets into the house unnoticed, which is stupid in its own right, places the waifs face on the wall and then has her confrontation with jaquen. The only 2 logical things to happen there is jaquen kills her for failing or does nothing as she is irrelevant to him, instead we receive another \"hey look how cool our main character is at the behest of any logical plot/character awareness\" with (kicking a dead horse here but still) the worst exchange of dialogue since bronn and the sand snakes.\n\nEssentially, the writers disregarded all established lore of the house of black and white to allow for what i assume they thought was a badass conclusion to arya vs the waif, which personally i didnt give a flying fuck about at any point, and fell completely flat on its face in the end. If thats what they had planned this whole time, they should have cut the entire arya braavos line and just had her train with the hound. She is now exactly the same grumpy teenager with a bunch of grudges that she was when she arrived, only she is a bit better at swinging a stick.\n\nI could go on for a long long time about the rest of this episode and the writers complete disregard for characters personalities and progressions but ive written enough about arya i think to get my point across.

Jaime gets to go back to King's Landing. \n\nSo all that budget blown on setting up tents, filming in an actual castle, resulted in twenty to thirty minutes of screen time: no actual fighting- just bad negotiations, an off screen death and another Lannister getting his way. Why even get Jaime to go in the first place? A siege is supposed to last years, not days, and literally nothing has changed of Jaime's character.  \n\nPiss on that, as the Westerosi say. Blackfish would never go out like that when he can still help Sansa. This is rushed writing at its worst, when dangling plotlines are smothered rather than allowed to unravel. Season 6 is still my favorite season, but the siege of Riverrun has been handled in an anticlimatic way and I'm left unsatisfied.   "], [2, "How is it obvious that a lot of time passed in Arya's story?"], [2, "For me, the biggest problem with it is that the breakneck pace of the season (which I thought was done really well in the first half of the season) has started to wear on the quality. With Arya's plotline, it's not JUST that the resolution was simple, but it was really thematically jumbled. I get that the idea of her time in Braavos is that it was supposed to be just a phase of Arya going through an identity crisis, and through her reconnection with her Westeros life through the play, she was triggered back to being herself. However, the depiction of this wasn't done really well, and ultimately, the straightforward ending to this arc makes the whole past two seasons of her arc feel somewhat hollow. I do feel like a lot of these problems have to do with the fact that the show wanted Arya to get back to Westeros/the main story, and with the time given, this character arc just didn't do enough to properly give a strong purpose to Arya's time in Braavos. \n\nMereen also has gone through clear pacing problems, as there really wasn't a lot of proper build-up to the Masters' big attack. I know that we knew it was coming, but the way that the show just slowed down the story by around episode 4 or 5, and then didn't delve to it at all in the past 2 episodes makes this big plot-point of the siege feel very tacked on, and with Daenerys' turn, I get the feeling the ending's going to probably be rushed too. Overall, this plotline kinda seemed like it just didn't have enough content to fill the necessary timeframe of the season, so it got stalled for a few episodes, leaving us with random scenes of Tyrion trying to make Missandei and Grey Worm more socially aware (which I actually kind of enjoyed, as those scenes DID depict the way Missandei and Grey Worm are what they are due to their experiences). \n\nAnd yeah, I really enjoyed the Riverrun plot in this episode, with the exception of the Blackfish's death being offscreen (for no real reason). \n\nOverall, I still really enjoyed the episode, and was very much enticed by the content of it, but there were just more plot problems with it than usual hindering my overall enjoyment of the episode. "], [2, "Because you're easy"], [2, "In general, people think in very defined terms and like things to be black and white with signposts and indications of how every thread has been resolved. It's the reason the sitcom has become one of the most popular forms of entertainment; bite sized stories that resolve themselves quickly and without a lot of fuss. It is also a huge reason why cliffhangers are so effective at getting people to come back for the following installment and are so infuriating when that follow up is never ... well, followed up on.\n\nSo, when a piece of fiction that has fluid characters and motivations releases on a staggered basis (television and comic books), some people will get angry and claim that \"this plot point makes no sense\" or \"nothing has happened this season (in general or with a specific plot line)\" after every episode, regardless of whether or not that's actually the case (which it may or may not be). \n\nThe major shifts in story and character aren't set up and resolved in any particular episode, they're transient. There's no single \"moment\" when Arya realizes she isn't cut out to be a FM; there's a moment when she decides to ACT on that by saving the actress, but the things leading up to that decision take place over several episodes; her frustration with the training, her inability to let go of her desire for vengeance, her need to understand \"why\" she is killing these people instead of just doing it because it's part of the organization's dogma. When rewatching it in a more immediate fashion (an episode or two a night over a few weeks or, in the comics equivalent, reading the trade) things flow a lot better and form a more cohesive whole.\n\nI'm not saying this is a conscious thing on behalf of viewers of Game of Thrones, this show requires a lot more effort to follow and comprehend on any meaningful level (one that I'm assuming most people in a Reddit discussion will possess), but it definitely does effect our perceptions subconsciously. \n\n(I'm ALSO not saying that this episode perfect or wasn't disappointing, or that anyone's specific criticisms are invalid. I felt very let down by Arya's story; more about HOW she ended up being wounded last episode than anything that happened this week... although I suppose there may be a reveal yet to come and even if we don't get it this season maybe D&D will retcon and have her explain how she set it up to Sansa or Jon.)"], [2, "No way it would take the waif 2-3 days to think to check the one woman who Arya knows.

Us as show watchers knew the Waif was coming for her because we were present for the information and Arya wasn't.   \n\nIt did suck that the blackfish got an off screen death but in reality the actor was 70 years old and probably couldn't do a fight scene.

If we're looking for an \"in-universe\" explanation, sure, this is fine.\n\nThe problem is that the set of challenges Arya faced had one obvious conclusion - Arya defeats the Waif. There's no way they're spending 6 seasons to develop the Arya character, and give her all of these experiences, and then have her get offed in an alley in Bravos by a assassin-trainee.\n\nDelaying the conclusion of this story could be done for two, different, *good* reasons:\n\n- To make the challenge she faced look very difficult, and add tension\n\n or\n\n- To develop either character further - maybe Arya has to make a change in herself to overcome her difficulties, or maybe we need to learn something more about the Waif before her character is eliminated\n\n\nHaving the bridge-stabbing scene did not establish any difficulty. We know the Waif has a knife, we know the Waif can change her face, and so does Arya. Frankly, it just made Arya look lazy, unprepared and foolish, which is pretty strange, because just the previous night she was holed up in a hiding spot with a weapon. It seemed pretty clear that she knew she was in danger, and would have to be cautious and sneaky.\n\nNone of the events established anything we didn't already know about the Waif or Arya. We knew the Waif was cruel and spiteful. That's basically her only known character attribute. Killing Lady Crane wasn't an \"oh shit\" moment. It was just a given that if those characters were in a room, the Waif would do that. \n\nArya didn't need to do any personal development to defeat the Waif. As soon as she left the House of the Black and White, she collected Needle, and symbolically reassumed her identity as Arya, rather than attempting to be \"no one\". Her first encounter with the Waif didn't convince her of that, she just.. briefly forgot to arm herself with her most important possession and only weapon? Basically, we learn that after she does the bare minimum of arming herself, she can kill the Waif easily.\n\nThe most elegant way to write these events better would have been:\n\n>  - Arya lures the Waif to her by casually strolling the market, and making a loud and obvious transaction to promptly leave Bravos.\n\n>  - The Waif attacks, but Arya is prepared. She is wounded to some degree, it is unclear how much. She jumps off the bridge and into the canal.\n\n>  - Cut to chase scene, exactly as in E08. Arya leads the Waif to her tunnel with blood trail, pretending to be mortally wounded.\n\n>  - As the Waif asks her how she would like to die, Arya stands up and retrieves Needle - it is suddenly clear that she is not wounded any more than superficially. She cuts the candle.\n\n>  - Cut to the House of the Black and White, Jaqen follows the trail of blood to the wall, and sees the Waif's face. Cryptic smile and acceptance.\n\n>  - Cut to Arya, on the ship that she booked out of Bravos. It is clear to the audience who survived, and that Arya is heading back to Westeros.\n\n\nInstead we got a bunch of filler scenes that didn't really do anything other than to confirm the death of a side-character, and add an \"artificial\" cliffhanger into the Arya story."], [2, "The arya storyline was written terribly.  It betrayed her character.  I also think that a trained assassin doesn't stalk his prey, weapon out, down crowded streets like a (bad) slasher movie.  Also, give the grey worm - missandei, lets get you to drink scenes a rest.  I agree about the blackfish. Why bring him back just to have him die off screen.  I felt they had a lot of potential for a great emotional scene that is thrown away and wasted.   \nI think this episode has some great stuff, but I am really starting to doubt D&D's chops without having source material to rely on.

I think it would have been better served by skipping the whole booking a passage scene and everything but the final confrontation  with the Waif.

I remember, and this isn't just nostalgia, having about one remarkably quotable line or impressively articulate scene just about every episode for the first three (maybe four seasons). The further we get from GRRM's writing, the more the show flails about. I honestly haven't heard a single bit of dialogue that I can I recall off the top of my head from seasons five and six. \"I am the God of tits and wine!\" \"The Lannister's send their regards.\" \"All men must die, but we are not men.\" It's not all about quotable lines of course. Think of the moments: The Red Wedding, Tyrion's trial, Arya and the three names, pretty much every really fantastic sequence to come from the series, has been ripped directly from the pages of the books. And I'm not saying they've done a horrible job of adapting them. There are many moments they simplified for the screen that worked out beautifully. But honestly, can you name any moments from the past two seasons? The only two I can even think of are Cersei's walk of shame, and For the Watch (I'm really not crazy about hardhome and the apparent revelation that wights and white walkers can't swim. Really? They can't fucking just freeze the water and walk on it?) moments that, you guessed it, also came straight out of the books. The way the Hound was reunited with the Brotherhood was lazy. The way Arya separated from the Faceless Men was lazy. It seems as if storylines are being stripped to their bare minimums to advance a plot that, I'm not even sure will be worth it when we get there. Characters are stripped away left and right to \"keep things simple for the tv audience\" but I'll be damned if this makes things any better. Can we just think objectively here? Was Hold the Door even that great a scene? It still doesn't make any fucking sense, Bran warged into Hodor in the past? No? Wyllas warged into his future self? What? How can Bran force someone to do that? There've been like seven different fan theories to explain what even happened in that scene. That's not a great scene. That's lazy execution. And its not like GoT is suffering from bad acting by any means, but I can't be the only one to think that Hold the Door is again a simplification of something GRRM intended to be more complex.

They could have had Arya encounter and fight the Waif at the end of E07 with absolutely no change to the overall plot, other than having everything make a whole lot more sense. This entire episode, and much of the last episode, of Arya was wasted screen time.\n\nTo recap, Arya hides in the sewers, leaves to book passages to Westeros, the Waif attacks and stabs Arya in an immediately nonlethal manner, Arya escapes, gets patched up by Lady Crane, who then gets killed by the Waif, who then chases Arya through the streets all parkour-style, at which point Arya's wounds suddenly reopen, and she leads the Waif into the dark to kill her.\n\nFirst, Arya would not go to the trouble of finding Needle and hiding in the sewers if her plan was to stroll up to a ship captain and pay for passage in broad daylight. I mean, she didn't even have Needle with her on the docks, and yet in the last episode she had it unsheathed and ready to use, as if she is expecting to be attacked at any moment. If she doesn't feel safe alone in the complete darkness of the sewers, why would she feel safe out in the open, surrounded by strangers, any of which could be a Faceless Man in disguise? Remember, she was explicitly told that she only had one chance, she knew people would come to kill her. Her behavior is not self-consistent, the writers need to explain why her behavior changes if we, the audience, are going to believe it. \n\nBut, for the moment, let's forget this point. Also forget the fact that Lady Crane can save Arya from a half-dozen, deep, hours-old, probably infected stab wounds. Lastly, forget that Arya could then run, jump, and roll perfectly fine for an extended chase scene before her wounds reopened. From a storytelling perspective, if Arya's stab wounds were just going to be open again for her second fight with the Waif, then there was absolutely no need to include Lady Crane in this episode at all, ESPECIALLY if they just want to kill her off with no real significance to the plot. She only served to let Arya survive and recover long enough to run around and get hurt again, unless her dialogue from the episode was MUCH deeper than I realize. As important and interesting as her character was in previous episodes, any motherfucker on the street could have found Arya, patched her up, and gotten killed by the Waif while contributing the EXACT same effect to the plot as Lady Crane did.\n\nIn addition, if the Waif knew that Arya was alive, why didn't she give chase after Arya threw herself over the bridge? In this episode the Waif finds Arya and tries to kill her again, which implies she somehow knew that Arya survived her first attempt and chose to let her go. Even if the Waif wanted to cause Arya extra suffering by letting her bleed out (directly against her orders, another plot hole which is left completely untouched so far) it is needlessly risky to let her escape; why not have the Waif try to follow Arya, wait until she loses too much blood to fight back, and then torture her until she dies? It's not like the show shies away from that sort of thing anyway, it would be self-consistent with the actions of the Waif in the show, and it makes a lot more sense than giving Arya another chance to escape Braavos.\n\nInstead, it would make sense to have the Waif chase Arya through the streets, only to have Arya lead the Waif to the sewers where Arya ultimately kills the Waif. Since Arya has been learning to read people's intentions during her time at the House of Black and White, it makes sense that she would anticipate the Waif's wish to drag out her death. She also knows the Waif thinks she is a failure as an assassin, which would explain why Arya ACTED so moronic on the docks; the Waif would never guess it was a trap, thinking Arya was just incompetent and being overly sure in herself. Arya could then lead the Waif into the sewers, kill her, then present her face to Jaqen. This would truly symbolize the completion of her training, having beaten her opponent by truly becoming the Waif, making her refusal to join the Faceless Men that much more powerful. All of which would fit perfectly at the end of E07, leaving a bunch of free screen time for whatever else the writers want to fit in. But as it is, it looks like Arya makes a bunch of dumb mistakes, gets incredibly lucky by finding her way back to the sewers, and remembers by accident that she knows how to fight in the dark. The current way it is written makes Arya look like an idiot, makes the Waif look like an even BIGGER idiot, makes the Faceless Men seem a lot less powerful and organized than before, brings up questions that are likely never going to be answered, all while butchering Arya's character arc and cheapening the entire purpose of her visit to Braavos.", "id": "d47490s"}, {"comment": "This sums up all the major gripes people had with the conclusion of Arya's act in Braavos.

I'm not shitting on Benihoff or Weiss exclusively considering others have written episodes too (Cogman, Hill), but the Arya story arch has been unacceptably pointless; even the most amateur of writers can point to a number of cringe-worthy mistakes made since she arrived in Bravos.\n\n> Arya clearly just got a false sense of security and made a genuine mistake, it is not bad writing whatsoever, and is a lot more plausible than Jaquen risking his life to give Arya a 3rd chance, which he specifically said he wouldn't do\n\nPutting aside my total disagreement with this assessment, I think the major issue is bigger than this. One of the key reasons why so many layered theories were flying around - some plausible, others less so - was indicative of the audience's reluctance to believe that her storyline could be so linear. Part of this is due to our high standards; GOT has often produced high caliber writing that, among other things, butters its bread with character development. So in this instance, when we see Arya making a seemingly careless mistake, we as an audience want this to segway into a final product that validates her time at the House of the Undying. Did an alternate persona, Arya Stark, get stabbed while the true Arya, the waif, wielded the knife? Did Arya anticipate the attack and feign her death in order to take revenge on the THOBW? Is there something, *anything*, that we as an audience haven't connected that can make these seemingly meaningless sequences come together in a way that impacts her character significantly enough that we can be comfortable with her having spent 3 seasons in Bravos? \n\nTo me, the answer is more or less no. Sure, you'll have some who will point to how she has matured, has learned she is not hellbent on revenge anymore (are people sure about that? doesn't seem like someone who reconfirms her identity as a Stark would just forget past transgressions against her) but the truth is, Bravos fell flat. Whether this is because GRRM didn't provide much guidance in terms of his notes for TWOW and beyond, or because Benihoff and Weiss simply went their own route will be interesting to find out. In any event, I think we can all agree that whatever lies ahead in the books for Arya will hopefully demonstrate a more clear sense of purpose and direction.", "id": "d46wd4q"}, {"comment": "> House of the Undying\n\nHouse of Black and White.

Why even get Jaime to go in the first place? A siege is supposed to last years, not days, and literally nothing has changed of Jaime's character.  \n\nPiss on that, as the Westerosi say. Blackfish would never go out like that when he can still help Sansa. This is rushed writing at its worst, when dangling plotlines are smothered rather than allowed to unravel.

With Arya's plotline, it's not JUST that the resolution was simple, but it was really thematically jumbled. I get that the idea of her time in Braavos is that it was supposed to be just a phase of Arya going through an identity crisis, and through her reconnection with her Westeros life through the play, she was triggered back to being herself. However, the depiction of this wasn't done really well, and ultimately, the straightforward ending to this arc makes the whole past two seasons of her arc feel somewhat hollow. I do feel like a lot of these problems have to do with the fact that the show wanted Arya to get back to Westeros/the main story, and with the time given, this character arc just didn't do enough to properly give a strong purpose to Arya's time in Braavos. \n\nMereen also has gone through clear pacing problems, as there really wasn't a lot of proper build-up to the Masters' big attack. I know that we knew it was coming, but the way that the show just slowed down the story by around episode 4 or 5, and then didn't delve to it at all in the past 2 episodes makes this big plot-point of the siege feel very tacked on, and with Daenerys' turn, I get the feeling the ending's going to probably be rushed too. Overall, this plotline kinda seemed like it just didn't have enough content to fill the necessary timeframe of the season, so it got stalled for a few episodes, leaving us with random scenes of Tyrion trying to make Missandei and Grey Worm more socially aware (which I actually kind of enjoyed, as those scenes DID depict the way Missandei and Grey Worm are what they are due to their experiences). \n\nAnd yeah, I really enjoyed the Riverrun plot in this episode, with the exception of the Blackfish's death being offscreen (for no real reason). \n\nOverall, I still really enjoyed the episode, and was very much enticed by the content of it, but there were just more plot problems with it than usual hindering my overall enjoyment of the episode.

It's the reason the sitcom has become one of the most popular forms of entertainment; bite sized stories that resolve themselves quickly and without a lot of fuss. It is also a huge reason why cliffhangers are so effective at getting people to come back for the following installment and are so infuriating when that follow up is never ... well, followed up on.\n\nSo, when a piece of fiction that has fluid characters and motivations releases on a staggered basis (television and comic books), some people will get angry and claim that \"this plot point makes no sense\" or \"nothing has happened this season (in general or with a specific plot line)\" after every episode, regardless of whether or not that's actually the case (which it may or may not be). \n\nThe major shifts in story and character aren't set up and resolved in any particular episode, they're transient. There's no single \"moment\" when Arya realizes she isn't cut out to be a FM; there's a moment when she decides to ACT on that by saving the actress, but the things leading up to that decision take place over several episodes; her frustration with the training, her inability to let go of her desire for vengeance, her need to understand \"why\" she is killing these people instead of just doing it because it's part of the organization's dogma. When rewatching it in a more immediate fashion (an episode or two a night over a few weeks or, in the comics equivalent, reading the trade) things flow a lot better and form a more cohesive whole.\n\nI'm not saying this is a conscious thing on behalf of viewers of Game of Thrones, this show requires a lot more effort to follow and comprehend on any meaningful level (one that I'm assuming most people in a Reddit discussion will possess), but it definitely does effect our perceptions subconsciously. \n\n(I'm ALSO not saying that this episode perfect or wasn't disappointing, or that anyone's specific criticisms are invalid. I felt very let down by Arya's story; more about HOW she ended up being wounded last episode than anything that happened this week... although I suppose there may be a reveal yet to come and even if we don't get it this season maybe D&D will retcon and have her explain how she set it up to Sansa or Jon.)", "id": "d4723r1"}], [{"comment": "No way it would take the waif 2-3 days to think to check the one woman who Arya knows.

They think everything has to be a crazy twist and turn for every moment and just can't accept things being pretty straight forward. \n\nWith Arya, she had no idea that The Waif was hunting her down, she was just a stupid kid wandering around until her ship was ready to leave.  Us as show watchers knew the Waif was coming for her because we were present for the information and Arya wasn't.   \n\nIt did suck that the blackfish got an off screen death but in reality the actor was 70 years old and probably couldn't do a fight scene.  Also he didn't go with Brienne because I think at the end of the day he knew he was getting tired of fighting and he just wanted his home and was not going to let it go peacefully.\n\nJaime took a huge step forward and resolved conflict just using his brain and reason instead of causing a giant bloody siege that would have killed many people.  His orders were to take the castle back not wipe out the Tullys, and he completed his mission and spilled no blood.\n\nNo clegane bowl is slightly disappointing but it makes sense because there is no reason for the hound to go anywhere near kings landing.

If we're looking for an \"in-universe\" explanation, sure, this is fine.\n\nThe problem is that the set of challenges Arya faced had one obvious conclusion - Arya defeats the Waif. There's no way they're spending 6 seasons to develop the Arya character, and give her all of these experiences, and then have her get offed in an alley in Bravos by a assassin-trainee.\n\nDelaying the conclusion of this story could be done for two, different, *good* reasons:\n\n- To make the challenge she faced look very difficult, and add tension\n\n or\n\n- To develop either character further - maybe Arya has to make a change in herself to overcome her difficulties, or maybe we need to learn something more about the Waif before her character is eliminated\n\n\nHaving the bridge-stabbing scene did not establish any difficulty. We know the Waif has a knife, we know the Waif can change her face, and so does Arya. Frankly, it just made Arya look lazy, unprepared and foolish, which is pretty strange, because just the previous night she was holed up in a hiding spot with a weapon. It seemed pretty clear that she knew she was in danger, and would have to be cautious and sneaky.\n\nNone of the events established anything we didn't already know about the Waif or Arya. We knew the Waif was cruel and spiteful. That's basically her only known character attribute. Killing Lady Crane wasn't an \"oh shit\" moment. It was just a given that if those characters were in a room, the Waif would do that. \n\nArya didn't need to do any personal development to defeat the Waif. As soon as she left the House of the Black and White, she collected Needle, and symbolically reassumed her identity as Arya, rather than attempting to be \"no one\". Her first encounter with the Waif didn't convince her of that, she just.. briefly forgot to arm herself with her most important possession and only weapon? Basically, we learn that after she does the bare minimum of arming herself, she can kill the Waif easily.\n\nThe most elegant way to write these events better would have been:\n\n>  - Arya lures the Waif to her by casually strolling the market, and making a loud and obvious transaction to promptly leave Bravos.\n\n>  - The Waif attacks, but Arya is prepared. She is wounded to some degree, it is unclear how much. She jumps off the bridge and into the canal.\n\n>  - Cut to chase scene, exactly as in E08. Arya leads the Waif to her tunnel with blood trail, pretending to be mortally wounded.\n\n>  - As the Waif asks her how she would like to die, Arya stands up and retrieves Needle - it is suddenly clear that she is not wounded any more than superficially. She cuts the candle.\n\n>  - Cut to the House of the Black and White, Jaqen follows the trail of blood to the wall, and sees the Waif's face. Cryptic smile and acceptance.\n\n>  - Cut to Arya, on the ship that she booked out of Bravos. It is clear to the audience who survived, and that Arya is heading back to Westeros.\n\n\nInstead we got a bunch of filler scenes that didn't really do anything other than to confirm the death of a side-character, and add an \"artificial\" cliffhanger into the Arya story.", "id": "d47m4v3"}], [{"comment": "The arya storyline was written terribly.

I remember, and this isn't just nostalgia, having about one remarkably quotable line or impressively articulate scene just about every episode for the first three (maybe four seasons). The further we get from GRRM's writing, the more the show flails about. I honestly haven't heard a single bit of dialogue that I can I recall off the top of my head from seasons five and six. \"I am the God of tits and wine!\" \"The Lannister's send their regards.\" \"All men must die, but we are not men.\" It's not all about quotable lines of course. Think of the moments: The Red Wedding, Tyrion's trial, Arya and the three names, pretty much every really fantastic sequence to come from the series, has been ripped directly from the pages of the books. And I'm not saying they've done a horrible job of adapting them. There are many moments they simplified for the screen that worked out beautifully. But honestly, can you name any moments from the past two seasons? The only two I can even think of are Cersei's walk of shame, and For the Watch (I'm really not crazy about hardhome and the apparent revelation that wights and white walkers can't swim. Really? They can't fucking just freeze the water and walk on it?) moments that, you guessed it, also came straight out of the books. The way the Hound was reunited with the Brotherhood was lazy. The way Arya separated from the Faceless Men was lazy. It seems as if storylines are being stripped to their bare minimums to advance a plot that, I'm not even sure will be worth it when we get there. Characters are stripped away left and right to \"keep things simple for the tv audience\" but I'll be damned if this makes things any better. Can we just think objectively here? Was Hold the Door even that great a scene? It still doesn't make any fucking sense, Bran warged into Hodor in the past? No? Wyllas warged into his future self? What? How can Bran force someone to do that? There've been like seven different fan theories to explain what even happened in that scene. That's not a great scene. That's lazy execution. And its not like GoT is suffering from bad acting by any means, but I can't be the only one to think that Hold the Door is again a simplification of something GRRM intended to be more complex.

At the beginning of the show she was kind of deluded (example: when she thought Joffrey would be a great husband and she wanted to be a princess/Queen) and extremely hateful towards Jon.  However, I think that this is because she was incredibly sheltered and she genuinely believes that if she is the 'perfect' lady she will be happy and marry well and be even more happy.  \n\nHowever, as the show progresses and more of her family dies/is presumed dead I think she slowly realizes that being a 'perfect' lady will get her killed and that there is no fairy tale ending.  As all that shit goes down with Ramsay I think Sansa realizes and shows the audience that in Westeros during this war you can't afford to just be a perfect lady and not play the game.  \n\nI kinda want Sansa to kick a$$ and destroy her enemies in a kind of girl power montage, but I like her character development thus far for blowing out of the water the whole 'fairy tale' trope.

Since then she has done a \"meh-to-good\" job of ruling, except for a huge resistance movement by the Harpies. \n\nThe drastic change in the season 5 finale and the movement back to the Dothraki just signals to me that the writers didn't know what to do with Dany in Meeren. You have a power team of Tyrion, Varys, Dany, Daario, Grey Worm, Missand, and eventually Jorah but there is little to no tension between these characters and in reality they should be able to own the situation of the harpies. \n\nNope. Gotta split the main characters up, going back to the simple tension created by having your main characters in imminent danger of rebels or blood riders. It's not that its terrible writing - it's just that its redundant in a \"it's like poetry, it rhymes\" kind of way.\n\nIt all comes down to this, where I think we mostly agree OP - Dany is still a naive ruler. Nothing wrong with that - it's been awesome watching her grow. The problem is that she hasn't been learning to be a better ruler this season - she's been showing off her powers (that GRRM specifically said was a one off after season 1, which makes me feel he has less impact on Dany's current story than we might initially have thought) and obtaining armies. If they want to make her into a mad king great that would be an awesome story, but I don't buy her as a wise ruler capable of conquering Westeros, nonetheless ruling Westeros and defeating the Others.\n\nI don't think Dany is going anywhere yet. The Greyjoy ships won't get to her too soon and her Meeren fleet is burnt. I won't rule out a very cool story that could be told once her horde arrives at Meeren, if it even does. But I'm very worried about what they are doing with her character - it's one thing to have Tyrion be funny with Varys while holding a city together *again*, but Dany looks like she is on full repeat of the season 1 best hits track tape.\n\nedit: I'm officially watching Dany as a potential \"fallen hero\" now, but I suspect this is all just shit writing from the show.

We saw her struggle with her idea of justice there, and realize that things aren't as black and white as they might seem.  This time she killed the khals to both free the people they were oppressing  (the dosh khaleen) and secure herself an army.  Mind you, these were rules the Dothraki put in place themselves.

Why does she even care about the iron throne and westeros if her ultimate goal now is to kill everyone and burn every city to the ground. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned that speech officially made Dany a villain.

Read the section about Aegon The Conqueror/Aegon the Dragon.  His conquest did not start out so differently, and he did eventually conquer and become the king of the 7 kingdoms.  He first helped wage the wars of the east but his focus was always in the west.  \n\nNow this is a bit of a stretch, but if we're on that train of thought - some popular theory is the Bran Stark is the original Bran The Builder as well.  Now I have not quite figured out in my head how this could be a trend, where current mains act as if they were the original big name member of their families history, but I do feel that it is the case based on Benjen saying the white walkers will make their way to man, and when they do bran will be there and he will be ready.  \n\nTL;DR you're right, she's acting unlike the original Dany and being influenced by all of the war she's had so far.

She arrives at Meeren and says she needs to rule, or more precisely, that she is not ready to go to Westeros. Since then she has done a \"meh-to-good\" job of ruling, except for a huge resistance movement by the Harpies. \n\nThe drastic change in the season 5 finale and the movement back to the Dothraki just signals to me that the writers didn't know what to do with Dany in Meeren. You have a power team of Tyrion, Varys, Dany, Daario, Grey Worm, Missand, and eventually Jorah but there is little to no tension between these characters and in reality they should be able to own the situation of the harpies. \n\nNope. Gotta split the main characters up, going back to the simple tension created by having your main characters in imminent danger of rebels or blood riders. It's not that its terrible writing - it's just that its redundant in a \"it's like poetry, it rhymes\" kind of way.\n\nIt all comes down to this, where I think we mostly agree OP - Dany is still a naive ruler. Nothing wrong with that - it's been awesome watching her grow. The problem is that she hasn't been learning to be a better ruler this season - she's been showing off her powers (that GRRM specifically said was a one off after season 1, which makes me feel he has less impact on Dany's current story than we might initially have thought) and obtaining armies. If they want to make her into a mad king great that would be an awesome story, but I don't buy her as a wise ruler capable of conquering Westeros, nonetheless ruling Westeros and defeating the Others.\n\nI don't think Dany is going anywhere yet. The Greyjoy ships won't get to her too soon and her Meeren fleet is burnt. I won't rule out a very cool story that could be told once her horde arrives at Meeren, if it even does. But I'm very worried about what they are doing with her character - it's one thing to have Tyrion be funny with Varys while holding a city together *again*, but Dany looks like she is on full repeat of the season 1 best hits track tape.\n\nedit: I'm officially watching Dany as a potential \"fallen hero\" now, but I suspect this is all just shit writing from the show.

Season 6 hit some really good notes but a LOT more bad ones.  \n\nThe north has the best plot this season, especially Bran's storyline, which should have been emphasized a lot more. Jonno&Salsa's plot has been great as well, a close match for Bran's plot. The Hound and BWB subplot is amazing but I doubt they'll play it out well with S7* and S8* being condensed to only 13 episodes in total.\n\nWhat made 1-4 so good despite book changes was that plot development was done very well. 1-4 were a huge blast for me. That's saying a lot because I was spoiled for a lot of major plot points before getting into the show. There was so much to be immersed in, so many plot lines to root for. The whole political dialogue and rivalry S1-S2 were built upon was very engaging. The entire night's watch plot was amazing (not to forget the 3 blasts scene, and Jon finding out that the wildings aren't savages after all). Arya's scenes with BWB, Jaqen, Tywin and the hound were absolutely wonderful. \n\nI also loved how \"filler\" scenes were used for character development instead of, well, filler. \n\nSeason 6 has sloppy writing and even sloppier execution. I was bored out by how the writing of Mereen was played out. Dany's scenes should've been replaced with more scenes with Tyrion and Varys sorting things out much like they did in S1 and the preparation of the KL siege in S2. Tyrion as hand of the king was one of the highest points of the series.\n\n A stronger focus on scenes with Tyrion, Missandei and Wurmzy sorting things out would make for better plot development and scenes in general compared to them telling jokes.\n \nIt's also so laughable how the writers and the director thought the Dany \"reveal\" in the previous episode was going to be impactful. Same goes with Arya's scenes.

I don't feel like they're doing it because those things are best for the story, but more because GoT has now gone super mainstream and they are under pressure to have 'shocking' and 'bad-ass moments' to keep the casual viewer excited. The fact that we are beyond the books contributes as well.\n\nTo me, the greatest part about GoT was always the twists and turns with the characters. Dragons, crazy vagiin monster, warging and all that is fun, and I'm a fantasy fan. But what has made GoT such a special thing is that the political back-stabbing, long-term character development and cleverness in the story. In a sense, it just happens to be set in a medieval fantasy land. Even without the fantasy aspect, following these people in any context would have made GoT (and ASOIAF) an amazing experience.\n\nAs G.R.R. Martin always points out by quoting William Faulkner. \u201cThe only thing worth writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself\u201d. The complexity of the characters has always been by far the best part, and to lose that is to lose most of what separates GoT from every other TV show.\n", "id": "d4elwz3"}, {"comment": "I feel like the plot is getting simpler in the plots where they don't have time to tell these complex plots.

The King's Landing (when the High Sparrow isn't around), Dorne (worst Dorne scenes so far, and just because it was only one episode doesn't really excuse it), Braavos, and now a lot of the Hound scenes have been some of the worst the show has seen.\n\nI would say this season is inconsistent, but not really great or bad. When it's good, it's the best it's ever been; but when it's bad it's very glaring. For example, episodes 1, 3, 7 and 8 have been the worst of the series (IMDb seems to agree, though that's a terrible gauge) but episodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 have been some of my favorites. If it weren't for that uninspired scene where the Children made the White Walkers, episode 5 would be my favorite of the series.\n\nThis was all my opinion, however, and I understand how this could be someone's favorite. It's had some of the best moments of the series. But it has unquestionably had some of the worst.

But the other scenes they had this season shows she cares about him, she believes in him and is trying to trust him.\n\nMy point is: yes there's going to be some conflict. Maybe Sansa thinks she didn't get the credit she deserves for saving the battle. (I don't think it's about the \"birthright\", cause it seems she got over her old prejudices against bastards and considers Jon her sibling as much as Robb, Arya, Rickon and Bran). Also I think Littlefinger will definitely try to use this to his advantage, try to manipulate her again and turn her against Jon. And Sansa is definitely more skilled in the game than she was before, she's not that sweet princess anymore. Maybe she will be tempted to listen to LF even.\n\nSo to me it's pretty clear that there will be conflict between Jon and Sansa but ultimately they'll support each other, cause honestly at this point they're all they have left in terms of family and trust.

You don't think it might cross Arya's mind that the person who put a contract on Crane might complain about it not only not being carried out but her being fingered? Unbelievably bad writing.\n\n> So Arya gets stabbed and seeks out her only friend, Lady Crane.\n\nSay you get mugged and your mugger decides last minute to let you keep your stuff and not kill you. You see the same mugger the next day profusely bleeding from stab wounds. Now you're best friends? This is such bad writing.\n\n> Another complaint about Arya here is that she beat the Waif while injured, but I believe this is underestimating the power of the dark for Arya.\n\nThe Waif was able to dodge every swing that Arya took at her when Arya was in good health but now after being stabbed, jumping from a window and rolling down stairs Arya becomes powerful because it's dark? The TV show didn't include Arya's ability to warg the cat. The TV show used lazy, bad writing to make Arya win despite making stupid mistakes that should have cost Arya her life. It's bad writing, plain and simple.\n\n> Then she returns to the House of Black and White. Now at first I thought this was weird, that she simply walked in without anyone knowing.

Then he would've had to inevitably die, which they would've had to draw out because they just gave him this big last stand... the whole thing wouldn't have worked.

Much more than Edmure. What really bugs me with this compared to the books is that its a fairly faithful adaptation, until hes about to escape. In the books he swims to escape, and has yet to be seen. He did die offscreen, so its possible hes still alive and others are covering for him, but if hes dead, his arc ended very weak after it started off strong this season.", "id": "d46zd9r"}, {"comment": "He's definitely preferred over Edmure. I think most people like him because in the books he's a bit of a revered war hero in Westeros. But, realistically, he means nothing to show-watchers.

He was the only survivor of the Red Wedding! (Edmure aside, because he was allowed to survive to be used as a caged breeder) He was the last remaining part of Robb's army, and as he stated: as long as he stood, the war wasn't over. In a way, he was even still fighting *for* Robb, going against the Freys and Lannisters.\n\n>The Edmure/Jaime scene was fantastic\n\nI mostly agree with this, except for the end of the scene. It was really great up until Jaime proclaimed it was all for Cersei, threatened Edmure with a catapulting, and Edmure just wimped out. Shitty finish for a scene that seemed like it was building towards something special. Edmure (another great actor from 'Rome') and Jaime really had a good back-and-forth, and Edmure even showed some spine for once.\n\nHaving Jaime be singularly obsessed with Cersei to this level is cringe-inducing, especially after I've heard book-readers describe how much differently he should be behaving. What are Jaime's redeeming qualities? He gave away his sword? (Just so he could abandon the vow he made) He allowed Brienne to escape? He gave Edmure a bath? After Jaime lost his hand, he seemed to be slowly becoming an honorable man, and it was fascinating to watch -- especially considering that we started the first episode of this show with him being the absolute villain.

It's even more evident with the snow falling in Winterfell in the episode 10 trailer and the white eagle flying overhead, which from what I've heard is a sign in Westeros that winter has arrived."], [5, "You make some good points. I'll address your second point about Ramsey. \n\nNow keep in mind that this is just my head canon and rationalization for WHY Ramsey does what he does. \n\nRamsey has a superior force and a defensible position. Winterfell, we know, can withstand siege with a force a fraction of what Ramsey has. So his full force could conceivably hold Winterfell against a substantially larger enemy. \n\nWe know that Ramsey isn't exactly the most tactically minded commander but we know he IS capable. \n\nSo why does he throw caution to the wind in a battle he doesn't need to fight?\n\n\n1) The North is not loyal to Ramsey Bolton. He knows this. We know of only two Houses that are somewhat loyal, the Umbers and Karstarks. And those are alliances of convenience. Both Houses could conceivably challenge the Boltons for supremacy in the North. So Ramsey needs a \"Statement Victory\". He needs to show the North that he is just as capable as his father was. He needs to win in such a way that no other House will dare challenge him. Withstanding a siege won't do that. Withstanding a siege in Winterfell won't prove anything to the Northern Lords\n\n2) A siege actually works against Ramsey. Say Ramsey holes up in Winterfell. Tactically sound strategy. But the longer the siege goes on, the more likely the North decides to switch sides. Remember, the North doesn't like Ramsey Bolton which is why Roose arranged the marriage to Sansa to begin with. A drawn out siege only gives the impression that Ramsey can be beaten. Think back to what Davos said about the Northern Lords and who they choose to back. The side they think will win. A siege will start to give the impression that Ramsey can lose or is afraid to fight against a numerically inferior force. If it starts to look like Ramsey can be beaten, the North may start to rally around the Starks\n\n3) A siege also gives more opportunity for Smalljon Umber or Karstark to betray Ramsey. If Ramsey is focused on the outside threat, he may not notice the inside threat. \n\n4) Ramsey is just impatient. Roose Bolton commended Ramsey on his command of the cavalry but also scolded him about abandoning defensible positions. It's in Ramsey's nature to march out and charge the enemy. Ramsey doesn't just want to defeat his opponent. He wants to crush them. Ramsey wants to cause as much pain and suffering to his enemies as possible.

Ramsay can't lose this battle in his own eyes, so there is no reason not to ride out to play with his food. But sticking to the rule of two trope (a common theme in this post moving forward), personally I think he rode out to meet with Jon for two reasons. First, he is curious. I think that Ramsay has a tremendous amount of respect for Jon based on what he has heard, and wants to see what the hype is about for himself. He wants to size him up in person. Second, and probably more importantly, his whole plan rides on him getting an emotional reaction out of Jon during the battle. He's using it as an opportunity to lay the groundwork for that reaction by dangling the fact that he has Rickon in front of Jon. I think he is also using it as an opportunity to gauge the effectiveness of his plan based on Jon's reaction. Plus, he's never going to miss the chance to psychologically torture his runaway bride, or anyone for that matter. As far as the battle is concerned, again in his mind he knows he is going to win, and he thinks that after defeating Jon the only threat to his reign until winter passes are the Karstarks and Umbers (rightly so, he doesn't know about the white walkers and no one is ever going to march north to challenge him once winter arrives). So in his mind he is destroying Jon like he destroyed Stannis, while at the same time destroying the armies that could potentially rise up against him in revolt during winter (the Umbers and the Karstarks). The battle plan is a win-win for Ramsay. But more on that later. \n\n3. My explanation for this one is completely circumstantial because like you said it is left untouched by the showrunners, but I've come up with a theory that allows me to sleep at night. Remember, Littlefinger tells the Boltons he is going to ride north with reinforcements, and up to this point Ramsay and the rest of the Boltons still think the Vale is on their side. On top of this, looking back to S6E5 Littlefinger tells Sansa he is already stationed at Moat Cailin, not that he is camped south of Moat Cailin. So by S6E5 I think he has already taken over the stronghold. My theory is that he didn't take Moat Cailin by force, he took it the same way Ramsay took it from the Ironborn, more or less. Littlefinger gets the Boltons still stationed at Moat Cailin to open the gates for him and a small reinforcement-type army and then the Knights of the Vale massacre the shit out of everyone there with little to no resistance. They probably don't show their full forces to them, and at this point the Freys are allied with the crown so they see Littlefinger as an ally and the Boltons as an enemy. No reason to warn Moat Cailin of anything. I agree that the end of the battle was still a complete rip off of LOTR though, and it was incredibly predictable. It was painfully obvious how it was going to play out way back in E5. \n\n4. Like you said, Jon's charge is a complete visceral reaction. But he is already as good as dead by the time he reaches Rickon.. he is well within range of the Bolton archers. Really his only option by the time Rickon is murdered is to ride forward. You're absolutely right that Jon's army shouldn't have let themselves be surrounded by the shield wall, but I think there is a solid explanation for that as well. Wun-wun is the only one that can see them coming because the wall of corpses is blocking the Stark army's view. So by the time they realize what's happening, they are already over halfway surrounded. I don't agree that Ramsay half-assed the battle though. We can't compare this battle to the battle with Stannis for two reasons. First of all, Roose still has final say against Stannis, which is why we see a more characteristic, non-Jokeresque battle plan. Secondly, Stannis doesn't have a cavalry anymore by the time he fights the Boltons, so taking them out was as easy for the Boltons as it was for Stannis to take out the Wildlings north of the wall. Jon has a cavalry, even if Ramsay had wanted to use the same tactics (which he wouldn't because it wouldn't be fun for his twisted little pleasures) he would not have had near the success he did against Stannis. \nIt's also important to remember two significant points. 1) As I've said before, he wants to kill off the Umbers and Karstarks just as badly as he wants to kill off the Starks. 2) He just likes to see people die, because he is a crazy MF. If he stays in Winterfell and waits out a siege, he doesn't have the opportunity for either of those, and he essentially is ensuring his own death because there's no way an already shaky northern host is going to stay loyal to him throughout winter if he cowers like a little bitch. I think Roose would have kept the north, but now that Ramsay is Warden the Bolton line has a much weaker claim to Winterfell and the rest of the north. Plus it just isn't in his nature. (That's what makes his character ark so amazing and interesting though, his strengths up to this point end up being the weaknesses that lead to his demise.) And to respond to why he doesn't send a second cavalry charge.. He doesn't have any cavalry left, he had just finished killing all of them. The only soldiers that didn't join the initial charge are infantry (foot soldiers). \n\nI'm going to end it here, but I could go on and on about Jon and Ramsay and why every single action taken in this episode by each of them was directly in line with their character personalities. If anyone has thoughts that contradict what I'm saying I'd love to hear them though! We are about to hit 60 hours of content, so I'm sure I've misinterpreted or missed something along the way.

", "id": "d4kaocn"}], [{"comment": "You make some good points. I'll address your second point about Ramsey. \n\nNow keep in mind that this is just my head canon and rationalization for WHY Ramsey does what he does. \n\nRamsey has a superior force and a defensible position. Winterfell, we know, can withstand siege with a force a fraction of what Ramsey has. So his full force could conceivably hold Winterfell against a substantially larger enemy. \n\nWe know that Ramsey isn't exactly the most tactically minded commander but we know he IS capable. \n\nSo why does he throw caution to the wind in a battle he doesn't need to fight?\n\n\n1) The North is not loyal to Ramsey Bolton. He knows this. We know of only two Houses that are somewhat loyal, the Umbers and Karstarks. And those are alliances of convenience. Both Houses could conceivably challenge the Boltons for supremacy in the North. So Ramsey needs a \"Statement Victory\". He needs to show the North that he is just as capable as his father was. He needs to win in such a way that no other House will dare challenge him. Withstanding a siege won't do that. Withstanding a siege in Winterfell won't prove anything to the Northern Lords\n\n2) A siege actually works against Ramsey. Say Ramsey holes up in Winterfell. Tactically sound strategy. But the longer the siege goes on, the more likely the North decides to switch sides. Remember, the North doesn't like Ramsey Bolton which is why Roose arranged the marriage to Sansa to begin with. A drawn out siege only gives the impression that Ramsey can be beaten. Think back to what Davos said about the Northern Lords and who they choose to back. The side they think will win. A siege will start to give the impression that Ramsey can lose or is afraid to fight against a numerically inferior force. If it starts to look like Ramsey can be beaten, the North may start to rally around the Starks\n\n3) A siege also gives more opportunity for Smalljon Umber or Karstark to betray Ramsey. If Ramsey is focused on the outside threat, he may not notice the inside threat. \n\n4) Ramsey is just impatient. Roose Bolton commended Ramsey on his command of the cavalry but also scolded him about abandoning defensible positions. It's in Ramsey's nature to march out and charge the enemy. Ramsey doesn't just want to defeat his opponent. He wants to crush them. Ramsey wants to cause as much pain and suffering to his enemies as possible. This means that beating Jon in an open battle in front of Sansa and all the North to see means more to Ramsey than just waiting out a siege. \n\n5) He clearly had no idea about the KotV ride north.

Now, she is becoming stronger, her line that Jon wasn't listening to her was out of place (as I said, that was just poor writing) but it didn't show her immaturity, it showed her becoming more assertive.

Compare that to daenerys who still isn't even able to maintain her rule without fear and bloodshed, a problem she has consistently had throughout the series, and you'll see just how much greater sansa has become.

She started as a whiny teenager, then the truth slapped her in the face repeatedly as she went through a *lot* of pain.

She can be Lady of Winterfell or whatever and still be important, but let the grownups handle the army of the dead.

As a character, I couldn't understand how people are saying that she's matured, etc. Yes, she isn't the same whiny little brat in S1 - but her sense of entitlement is still very much there, just under the veneer of being this supposedly \"independent kickass woman\". As an actress, Sophie is not the worst, but she's definitely not the best that some fans are insisting that she is. Heck, half the time she's on screen, I can't even tell what she's supposed to be feeling - the very fact that there's even a debate going on about whether or not she's going to turn on Jon because of her last scene/look with Littlefinger speaks volumes: her fans are saying she's genuinely happy for Jon, but the actors/writers/producers (in the bts video) themselves say that Sansa is \"pissed\". \n\nAnyway, I'm sure Sophie is a fun and good person, but I personally can't appreciate her tendency to act unprofessional (getting drunk before a panel, who does that?) and even being borderline snobby or rude in some of the interviews.

Her Ramsay scene was excellent, her facial expressions have been consistent and subtle (I wouldn't say one note). \n\nHonestly, I think its the writing that has made Sansa such a weird, divisive character for some people. In the books, she's just barely begun to flirt with a more hardened, savvy personality. The show not only rushed that development, but I think, handled it poorly during Season 5. Thus in Season 6 when she gets ANOTHER empowerment arc, after having been so dashed in Season 5, she can come off as forced/stale, or as another poster mentioned \"bitchy/angry\" in almost a heavy handed way. How else is she to play it though, when clearly that is what D&D wrote for her? \n\nI think certain character developments haven't been earned. This was a problem for me with Arya this season.

Jon DOESN'T want the Iron Throne. And he has no claim. His father did not marry his mother, or if he did, in the Faith of the Seven, he committed adultery, being already married to Elia Martell, who he did not divorce. And polygamy is also banned by the Faith, which the Targryans adopted. His Targaryan father did not acknowledge him, so he isn't even a \"legal\" bastard. His position as King in the North is predicated on his ruling the North in secession from the King in King's Landing. And the Northern Houses will not support a campaign to conquer the South. More, he has enough problems in the North, pacifying the former rebel houses, settling the Freefolk and getting ready to defend the Wall.\nAs far as Danerys and Jon, Danerys has already granted Yara independence for the Iron Islands, there's no reason she couldn't accept an autonomous North, especially if she marries Jon (aunt or not), she holds the Iron Throne, the Sand Snakes rule Dorne as an autonomous kingdom, the Iron islands are an allied independent kingdom, Jon as King in the North and Danerys' husband holds the North, the Riverlands go to the Tulls (the Freys get exterminated), the Reach becomes Crownlands after Ohlenna dies (no male Lannisters left), as does the Stormlands. Danerys directly rules King's Landing, the Crown Lands, the Reach and the Storm Lands. As Jon's wife and as Jon is King in the North and Lord Paramount, Danerys, as Queen, is obligated to come to the defense of the North when the Nights King, the White Walkers and the Wights finally breach the Wall. Dorne and the Iron Islands as autonomous and independent allied kingdoms are obligated to send troops also. So you get Jon at the head of the Northern levys, with a healed Jorah leading the levies of the South, Theon the levies of the Iron Bound and one of the Sand Snakes (?) leads the Dornishmen. Danerys also has the survivors of her Unsullied, who would be part of her Guards and Dothraki, which would have been settled in the lands between Dorne and the Reach and the Storm Lands. and then Danerys would show up when needed with the dragons.\nNow as far as Cersei, you probably hit her propaganda on the nail. Cersei will portray herself as the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms and Danerys as a foreign conqueror. Even her support from the Martells (savage southerners who worship weird gods and let women rule them, women who murdered their rightful Lord and his Heir) and the Tyrells (rich and ambitious deviants willing to sell their souls to the foreign devil) can be cast in an evil light.\nBut Danerys will be saying she comes to liberate the Seven Kingdoms from an usurper, without any royal blood, who murdered her sons and her husband to get to the throne, uses banned sorcery to enslave her servants, has a Maester drummed out of the order as her chief advisor, holds power as a bloody tyrant through direct force of the King's Guards, City Watch and Lannister troops and is engaged in incestuous relationship with her twin brother. If Littlefinger brings the Vale over, then she's allied with the man who betrayed the Starks, the Boltons, who's morals and ethics are in question and was the biggest pimp in Westeros, and as far as raving mad reivers, there's her probale alliance with Euron."]], [[{"comment": "D&D have described the Night King as just *Death*.

He will be a hero by killing his sister/wife, eventually betraying his house, allying with Starks, and running off with another woman.\n\nOnly %1 of all people would be sad for her, I think, and those are Cersei stans on the internet.

Period. This was George RR Martin's intention, and actually she is a lot worse in the books, they softened her in the show. She is a bad mother in the books and she is the one who did many things that were done by others in the show, like killing Robert's bastard children and babies (and Jaime is better in the books, Cersei is nothing like Jaime). \n\nAnd those were only her beginnings.

She got worse and worse, and next season we will see her going completely to dark side...she won't be any better than Ramsay or Joffrey. She will hook up with her soulmate Euron and they will be the ultimate villains (they are Freyja and Odin in Norse mythology). All villains are a bit better in the beginning, then they gradually turn into monsters...this is even true for all killers and other psychos in real world...they aren't born exactly as psychopaths, but they are born with a tendency to be psychopaths. \n\nI said this a hundred times to Cersei stans, Cersei's madness doesn't come from frustration. People normally don't turn into psychopaths just because they got frustrated in life etc. Most people fail to live their dreams and have difficult lives, but they don't become psychopaths...only those few who already have those pscyhopathic traits in them turn into monsters with a little push.\n\nPsychopaths don't deserve sympathy."], [2, "\"Don't be so hard on Cersei.

Yet they tried their best with what they were given instead of using it as an excuse and painting themselves martyr. \n\nAlso, want to talk about how Robert disrespected Cersei by whispering Lyanna's name?

If I remember correctly he got drunk and hit her during the feast at Winterfell in the books.  Also, while Robert got to sleep with every tavern wench in the kingdom without repercussions, Cersei would have been executed for treason for having fun on the side with her brother.  So as a modern feminist, I can sympatheize with her perspective.  However, that is what upper class women in the Middle Ages had to deal with.  Kings and lords all had mistresses on the side and many of the marriages probably involved marital rape and domestic abuse, especially if the woman came from a family with less status than the man.

All villains are a bit better in the beginning, then they gradually turn into monsters...this is even true for all killers and other psychos in real world...they aren't born exactly as psychopaths, but they are born with a tendency to be psychopaths. \n\nI said this a hundred times to Cersei stans, Cersei's madness doesn't come from frustration. People normally don't turn into psychopaths just because they got frustrated in life etc. Most people fail to live their dreams and have difficult lives, but they don't become psychopaths...only those few who already have those pscyhopathic traits in them turn into monsters with a little push.\n\nPsychopaths don't deserve sympathy.", "id": "d8fahnv"}], [{"comment": "\"Don't be so hard on Cersei.

Rather than saying \"Help your friends\" or \"Go back and warg into Hodor\" the Three Eyed Raven tells Bran \"Listen to your friend Bran\" and at that point he makes a realization, you can see it in his face.\n\nHe then wargs into Hodor and takes control of him to pull himself to safety and help Meera.  The strange thing is that he is still in the past with the Three Eyed Raven and is still looking at the past version of Hodor.  He is literally in two places at once, one part of himself is controlling Hodor and the other part is still in the past.\n\nOnce the door is closed and Bran knows that it needs to be held for them to survive he wargs into Hodor in the past and implants the command in his mind.  Something that he can never forget and the reason for his part in the journey.  He needs to hold the door, that's the only thing that matters.\n\nSo if this is true then it tells us some interesting things about his ability to Warg.  First of all he can warg into the past and see events that have happened.\nSecond, he may not be able to directly influence the past but he can make his presence known as well as warging into others to get the job done.\nThird, he can be two places at once and possibly more.  How many people can he control at once? How many places can he be at once?\n\nSo how does this relate to the Night King?  What if he is a warg on the other side of the fight.  He is in direct control of every zombie and every White Walker.  The White Walkers are simple those he was able to take alive (like Crasters boys) and he augments their abilities with those of the dead.  Notice when Bran sees the army of the dead and the White Walkers the army doesn't notice him until the Night King notices him.  Is he simply powerful enough that he can see through a warg or is he one himself?\n\nSome more supporting evidence comes in the revelation that the Children of The forest created the White Walkers.  From what we saw it looks like they created the White Walkers from the first men that they were fighting.  We also know that the Starks have the blood of the first men and that this is most likely responsible for their ability to warg.

All psychopaths pretend like they have emotions and empathy, they understand the concept of love, they can't really feel it but they are very good at roleplay. \n\nI never believed that Cersei is capable of feeling something real, she was softened in the show but in the books it is clear that everything she says is a lie, she just acts like she loves Jaime in order to use and manipulate him and although she cares about her children it's mainly because she sees them as her property and means of power as well. She is a terrible mother, she sacrificed her children for power, only pretending that she did everything for them. \n\nDo you really believe that a mother who really loves her child wouldn't even care what he wants, drive her child to suicide and just look at his dead body, say \"burn him\", walk away and sit on the throne proudly the same day? What Jaime noticed in season 6 finale was that Cersei didn't even look unhappy although their last child had just died...she looked pleased and proud. She was upset when her other children were dead because she can't stand \"losing\", the one thing psychopaths can't stand is to lose...they must own things and they must win. Do you really believe that a woman who loves a man either as a brother or as a lover would just look at him coldly and and say things like \"what took you so long\", \"I'm angry because you left me here alone\" etc. when he returned with one hand in misery and pain? She wasn't even pleased to see him or sorry for him. Not to mention that she was just fucking other men when he was being tortured in dungeons. \n\nShe told Septa Unella that she fucked Jaime because \"it felt good\", not because she loved him or cared about him. She said she killed her husband because \"it felt good\", not to protect her children or anything like that. She only cares about herself, she does things only because they please her. \"Because it feels good\" is a typical phrase of a psychopath. She is a portrait of a psychopath, psychopaths fool a lot of people. She began to show her real face now, this is what this story is about. Jaime started to see her real face now, just as he did in the books...he says that \"she was a stranger all the time, hiding her true face from his gaze\", in the books. \n\nCersei is driven by power, not emotions.

She knows women are powerless so of course she wants power.\n\nWhat would Daenarys be without her dragons? Nothing.\nWhat would cersei be if she wasn't Queen? Nothing.\n\nThe reason why I think Cersei hates Tyrion so much (other than he killed their mother) is because even though he is a dwarf she would prefer to have his life more so than her own. She's jealous. She hates him so much because even as a dwarf he has power because he is a man. Cersei said before she would prefer to be a man and I think it goes deeper than that.

So unless you are claiming Robert impregnated Lyanna from hundreds of miles away which resulted in an at least 14 months long pregnancy, there is no fcking way in seven hells that Robert can be the father.\n\n>While yes Jon is described as looking very Stark-esque, his appearance doesn't really share any common ground with the Targs. No violet eyes, no pale hair, and he ain't fire proof as he burned his hand.\n\nTaragryens are not fire proof. Dany's funeral pyre thing was a one time miracle event.\n\nAnd many other Targaryens with dark haired dark eyed mothers also looked like their mothers. And no, it has nothing to do with \"boys look like father, girls look like mother\". Baelor \"Breakspear\" Targaryen whose mother was Mariah Martell, looked just like his mother. Duncan \"the Small\" Targaryen who mother was Betha Blackwood, looked just like his mother. Daeron \"the Drunken\" Targaryen whose mother was sandy brown haired Dyanna Dayne, looked just like his mother. \n\n>He looks JUST LIKE the Baratheons\n\nNo he fcking doesn't. Baratheons have raven black hair and blue eyes. All of them. All of Robert's kids. Jon has dark brown hair and blackish grey eyes. Dark brown hair and grey eyes are Stark features. I swear a God, this stupid theory only exists because Kit Harrington's hair looks black for the most of the show. That is the only frigging reason and it is ridiculous.\n\n\n>Rhaegar was famously literate and musical. Now granted that last point is a bit weak, but when combined with the genetics it forms a better picture.\n\nExcept it doesn't. In fact, Jon's personality is pretty much like Rhaegar's, they are both dark, brooding introverts with not much friends.\n\n>Plus this could explain why Rhaegar left Lyanna at ToJ and rode off to fight.\n\nExcept we already know why he left ToJ. He was summoned by his own father and king to lead the armies of the crown. In fact, he wasn't simply summoned, but the commander of the kingsguard Sir Gerold Hightower was sent to find and bring him back. Seriously, as if you would need and explanation for crown prince leading the crown's armies.\n\n>And it would still give Ned reason to protect him from Robert. Maybe he doesn't want any of his family involved in the politics of the Seven Kingdoms, and knew that if Robert learned of his son by Lyanna he would demand to have control over the boy's life. So off to the Wall where your lineage means nothing to anybody, and thus never investigated.\n\nNone of this makes sense. Protect him from Robert? Doesn't like his family in politics? If Jon was Robert's son from Lyanna, that would mean Ned's own nephew would be king some day. Instead he steals his own nephew's legacy and forces him in a life of shame as same bastard from an unknown mother only to rot in the wall. How is this a favor for anybody? Bullfckingshit. The only reason to hid Jon, is if he is Rhaegar's son. In that case, Robert and all of the alliance that put him on the throne would want him dead because that would make Jon the next Targaryen heir. \n\n\n>I'm sure there's some evidence that refutes a lot of this, but I haven't found it yet.\n\nLiterally a quick search through the wiki or even a search to this sub's or /r/asoiaf history would easily provide you with all the evidence that explains why this isn't even remotely possible. The only reason you haven't found any, is because you never searched for it. Do all of us a favor, next time you come up with an \"oh so original\" theory, do fcking google it before making a shi\u015ft post about it. "], [3, "> While yes Jon is described as looking very Stark-esque, his appearance doesn't really share any common ground with the Targs. No violet eyes, no pale hair, and he ain't fire proof as he burned his hand.\n\nFirst flaw with your theory. Targaryens are not immune to fire.\n\n* Viserys was killed by molten gold\n* Tragedy at Summerhall was a fire that killed 2 Targaryens\n* Aerion Bright flame was burned to death by drinking wildfire\n\n> So what are we to think? Genetics are a very potent power in this universe (Griff has to dye his hair often, Gendry has the same hair and build as his father, and let's not forget all the Lannister kids). So why then, if Jon was half Targ and half Stark, would he really only share his mother's traits? And (to my knowledge mind you) it seems gender has a strong hand in this too. The girls look like their mothers and sons like their fathers. I'm sure there's some middle ground, but still the Targ dynasty was built in these hyper-potent genetics.\n\nThe Targaryen dynasty was built on the idea that their blood allowed them to tame dragons, which was proven false during the Dance of the Dragons when commoners also tamed dragons.\n\nNot to mention that the \"girls look like their mothers and sons like their fathers\" is incorrect. Arya looks like Lyanna, while Robb, Bran and Rickon are all noted to look like Tully's and not much like Northmen.\n\n> But I think his FATHER is Robert Baratheon.\n\n> He looks JUST LIKE the Baratheons. Dark hair, strong jaw, and he has an aptitude for battle. \n\nExcept that the Baratheons have strong square jaws while Northmen and Targaryens are all shown to have long, thin faces. And both groups have dark hair and are skilled fighters.\n\n> Plus episode 9 of season 4 Sam asks Jon to describe being with Ygritte and he can't because 'he's not a bleeding poet'. Rhaegar was famously literate and musical. Now granted that last point is a bit weak, but when combined with the genetics it forms a better picture.\n\n> Plus this could explain why Rhaegar left Lyanna at ToJ and rode off to fight. He may have even beat her out of rage when he told him that she'd been with Robert.\n\nExcept Rhaegar is noted to HATE fighting and love loving. He was a poet at heart, a minstrel and a singer. Barristen Selmy,  his best friend, says that he hated fighting and that he loved singing and was charitable.\n\n> And it would still give Ned reason to protect him from Robert. Maybe he doesn't want any of his family involved in the politics of the Seven Kingdoms, and knew that if Robert learned of his son by Lyanna he would demand to have control over the boy's life. So off to the Wall where your lineage means nothing to anybody, and thus never investigated.\n\nExcept that makes no sense. Ned doesn't want Jon to be sent to the Wall, it's only when Jon pleads for Benjen to speak with Ned that Jon was sent.\n\nNot to mention it explains why the secret was kept from Robert and the Southern Lords, but not why he lied to Catelyn. If it was Robert's son with Lyanna, I doubt he would bear the shame of a bastard and not tell his wife the truth.\n\n> I'm sure there's some evidence that refutes a lot of this, but I haven't found it yet. I just find it interesting that most people accept Rhaegar as Jon's father almost immediately without thinking about his appearance.\n\nThere is, a lot.\n\n* When Lyanna was taken from Winterfell, Robert was in the Eyrie.\n* It was over a year later that Ned was at the Tower of Joy and found Lyanna in the bed of blood, implying that the birth was happening or had just happened.\n\n* This means that Robert could not have been the father. Ned himself bedded Catelyn once at the start of the war (long after Lyanna was taken) and he came home to Robb who was several months old already.\n\nNot to mention the WEAK \"genetic\" evidence. Dark hair and aptitude for fighting are common among First Men and Baratheons, even Greyjoys. A strong jaw doesn't mean anything, and Jon is repeatedly said to look like Arya who is supposed to look like Lyanna.\n"], [2, "I think Jon was born from sea foam like Aphrodite"], [2, "I don't buy it.  I don't see Ned letting him go off to the wall that easily.  The wall was a protection for Jon.

And other Targaryens have been hurt/killed by fire as well. The Tragedy at Summerhall, for example. As GRRM has stated multiple times, Targaryens are not immune to fire.\n\n> So why then, if Jon was half Targ and half Stark, would he really only share his mother's traits?\n\nBecause Targaryen traits are recessive and they've only been able to maintain them through their practice of inbreeding.\n\nIt has been common earlier in the Targaryen line when marrying other houses for the offspring to take on the other family's traits instead.\n\nLyanna has also been described as stubborn and strong-willed which, while not very scientific, I've always interpreted as a hint about dominant genes.\n\n> Plus this could explain why Rhaegar left Lyanna at ToJ and rode off to fight. He may have even beat her out of rage when he told him that she'd been with Robert.\n\nJon was born around the Sack of King's Landing, which means he must have been conceived a little bit after the start of the rebellion.

Even on his deathbed, Ned wouldn't tell him because of the anguish it would leave Robert in. Ned didn't want to stain Robert's last hours with violence, and revealing that would have sparked something I'd imagine. Plus he writes 'rightful heir'. Yes, that is probably aimed to let Gendry take over, but maybe Ned had someone else in mind. I don't think Ned had a soft spot for Targ kids so much as just kids in general.

Want i wanted to say is I HOPE THEY WON'T. That would seriously make last night's episode less impactful and a bit cheesy. \n\nAbout Roose. Let me explain better. Roose in the books is a bit different. He knows he will never have an heir because, well Ramsay. Therefore he doesn't give a shit and tries to teach Ramsay how not to be a dumbass. ( it doesn't work ). But in the show he is different. He constantly taunts Ramsay with the fact that he is only a Bastard and is poking him with the fact that he might have a new heir. I just think he is too smart that after knowingly \"bitchslapping\" Ramsay with that fact many times, he would fall for such a stupid thing as a \" loving \" hug especially from Ramsay who is a known psycho in Got Universe.
