He was already playing guitar, composing rock,  and alternative tunes at a very young age,  until allured by high-end electronica, he paired up with Ojos to create their successful Trancemission project almost a decade ago.

I am sure you'll love it!\n\nI'm not sure what people do in Reykjav\u00edk. But if you like camping I could tell about some cool spots :)", "id": "d17dtmi"}, {"comment": "Camping would be great!  Reykjavik was fun, but we definitely enjoyed getting out into the countryside and would love to do that more next time.", "id": "d17f7ms"}, {"comment": "Ok, so here is a [map](http://imgur.com/1ILdAgQ). I recommend using [ja.is](http://ja.is/kort/?type=map) for a more detailed map.\n\nRemember, don't take anything but pictures, and don't leave anything but footmarks! Tourists have a bad reputation, so don't be one of those. Be a traveler instead, show respect to our nature. Don't leave trash and especially: Do not shit in the woods and leave it behind!\n\na) So the first place I would recommend to anyone is \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk (a2). This place is just fantastic. You'd need a big vehicle to reach it, or you can hike from either Sk\u00f3gar (a1) or Landmannalaugar (a3), although you would also need a big vehicle to reach Landmannalaugar. There are buses that go to all three places though, so no worries. For experienced hikers I would recommend starting at Sk\u00f3gar (a1), hike over Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls (where the infamous volcano erupted) and into \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk (a2). It's about 25 km so I recommend staying overnight in a hut which is located on top of Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls. From \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk (a2) to Landmannalaugar (a3) is the most widely known hiking path in Iceland; Laugavegur. It's over 40 km and there are four huts if I recall correctly. You can contact Fer\u00f0af\u00e9lag \u00cdslands (www.fi.is) if you wish to stay in the huts, or you can just bring a tent. Also, bring bunch of food, there are no shops en route. There are some shops in \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk and maybe Landmannalaugar, but stock up BEFORE you get there. Please, don't be one of those idiots who gets lost without any food and needs a rescue squad. Nobody likes those. It's also super expensive to be rescued. I recommend this early in the summer (not open in the winter), it's a popular trail and people are disgusting so the trail, and especially Landmannalaugar, stocks up on trash and shit over the summer and becomes pretty filthy after July.\n\nb) Second place on the list is the island Flatey in Brei\u00f0afj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. To get there you can take a ferry from either Stykkish\u00f3lmur or Brj\u00e1nsl\u00e6kur. There is a camping site there and a heavily overpriced hotel. No convenience store, you have been warned. A good idea would be to approach the locals (hotel staff for example) and ask them about local attractions, but the town and the island itself is pretty cool. Sometimes the farmers are willing to take travelers on boat rides, which I would totally recommend, it's a very beautiful place. Even better would be to talk to some locals in Stykkish\u00f3lmur and try to find someone who can take you through the south part of Brei\u00f0afj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, which is even better.\n\nc) Now, the third one is pretty obscure and I'm not sure if I can describe it or if the place is even exists anymore. If you start in B\u00edldudalur and travel east on the highway you will travel through three fjords. I think it's in the middle one (Reykjarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur) where there is a natural hot tub. There is a house close to it, but no one lived there last time I was there. It's been a few years so take it with a grain of salt. On Vestfir\u00f0ir there are natural hot tubs everywhere, so if you don't want to risk not finding this one (it's pretty small), just ask the locals, there are some nice ones just outside of T\u00e1lknafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur for example. Also, ask the locals about attractions, there are plenty of those around. If you are around this area, don't miss Dynjandi. It's a big waterfall just off the highway between B\u00edldudalur and \u00deingeyri.\n\nd) The tiny village of Drangsnes is next up. If you get lucky you might see a couple of whales out in the fjord. There is a great swimming pool in the town, but an even better one just north of the town, in a little valley. You can also drive north from Drangsnes to get to Strandir, which is a fantastic hiking place. For experienced hikers I would recommend contacting Fer\u00f0af\u00e9lag \u00cdsland (www.fi.is) and see if they have groups going to Hornfjall. It's a beautiful route (takes a few days), only reachable by boat. I haven't been there, but I have sailed just north of it and it's just magnificent, and I believe the northern-most point of the Icelandic mainland.\n\ne) Now we are getting to some popular places. M\u00fdvatn, and the area around it is a really cool place, but if you get unlucky there might be way to many tourists around. Go early in the summer, tourist season doesn't really start full force until after mid June.\n\nf) \u00c1sbyrgi is also one of the most known places in Iceland but it has the added benefit of being in the middle of nowhere so there are not many tourists around. Should definitely check it out, it's really, really cool. But if you want to stay the night, go back out to highway 1 and drive west for about 5 minutes. There should be a turn to go south to Vesturdalur, which is a much less popular place, but even cooler, all things considered. The road to Vesturdalur might not be open, so ask someone before you go there. Park rangers in \u00c1sbyrgi should know exactly if/when it is open and if your car can handle it. From Vesturdalur you can hike around in Hlj\u00f3\u00f0aklettar, or hike south with the (huge ass) river to Dettifoss.\n\ng) M\u00f6\u00f0rudalur used to be on highway 1, but they changed it and now the road is in pretty bad shape. Last time I knew there was still a restaurant and a camping site, and if you are running out of gas, there might be a chance they have some on stock there. Don't count on it though.\n\nh) This small forest is called Vaglask\u00f3gur. It's a really nice place for camping, not many tourists. Just go the northern end and find a nice spot inside the forest. The south end is mostly a trailer park for locals, some of them stay there for weeks or months. On a nice night there is a good chance you can find a party in the southern area.\n\ni) OK. I wasn't going to include this because, well everyone knows about J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n and it's cramped with tourists. But the area is really, really beautiful, with the largest glacier in Europe and the tallest mountain in Iceland. Bunch of hiking trails and camping sites, and it's a big place. Most of the tourists just go to J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n and back to Reykjav\u00edk, so there might not be to many people. Again, go early in the summer to avoid tourists.", "id": "d17we8b"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the info!", "id": "d18upo1"}, {"comment": "Holy crap, that is bad.", "id": "d17pbks"}], [{"comment": "bad song but interesting video", "id": "d176rv7"}], [{"comment": "[Some norwegian rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWShyw4Dok0) for anyone interested.

Bending bluegrass, rock and countless other influences that the band cites, Yonder has pioneered a sound of their own.  With their traditional lineup of  instruments, the band may look like a traditional bluegrass band at first glance but they\u2019ve created their own music that transcends any genre.  Dave Johnston points out \u201cWhat could be more pure than making your own music.\u201d  Yonder\u2019s sound cannot be classified purely as \u201cbluegrass\u201d or \u201cstring music\u201d but rather it\u2019s an original sound created from \u201clooking at music from [their] own experiences and doing the best job possible.\u201d  The band continues to play by their own rules on their new record The Show.\n\n> The Colorado-based foursome has crisscrossed the country over the past eleven years playing such varied settings as festivals, rock clubs, Red Rocks Amphitheater in the band\u2019s home state, and recently the Democratic National Convention in Denver at Mile High Stadium opening for Barack Obama.  Their loyal fanbase has been built from this diverse setting of music venues as fans latched on to their genre-defying original sound.\n \nIn between tours the band spent time this last year working on its fifth studio album. Set for a September 1 release on the band\u2019s own label, The Show is the second album with rock producer Tom Rothrock (Beck, Elliott Smith, Foo Fighters). While some might scratch their heads as to why a string band would want a rock producer, this decision was a natural choice for the band.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of nostalgia for the past,\u201d says banjo player Dave Johnston. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t try to recreate the 1940s. I like to think of us as informed by the past and all the great performers before us. But we also want to look forward rather than give people something that has already been perfected.\u201d\n \nThe Show has the similar acoustic instrumentation (Adam Aijala on guitar, Johnston on banjo, Jeff Austin on mandolin and Ben Kaufman on bass with all four singing) as many of its classic bluegrass forefathers. Though once again drums are present (as with the self-titled fourth album) with the great Pete Thomas of Elvis Costello\u2019s bands adding a rhythmic backdrop to Yonder\u2019s still-acoustic sound on six of the tracks. The record consists of thirteen songs all written by Yonder.\n  \nThe band has long cited such varied influences as the bluegrass of Del McCoury, Johnson Mountain Boys, Jimmy Martin, Bill Monroe, Osborne Brothers as well as the punk rock of Bad Religion, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys.  Somewhere in between these two tent poles are early 20th Century composers and alternative rock bands like Grandaddy and Postal Service. It\u2019s  all funneled through the band\u2019s unique chemistry, honed since they first met at an informal club performance in 1998. With band members writing individually, in different pairings and as a collective, the album proves that this group is a collection of creative peers and you can hear it in the rich tapestry of music that makes up The Show.\n \nHere Yonder offers such traditional bluegrass sounding fare as \u201cOut Of The Blue\u201d and \u201cCasualty.\u201d The band has explored its country roots in the past and does so again this time on \u201cSteep Grade, Sharp Curves,\u201d a song that describes the roads around its home base in Nederland as well as a particularly dangerous femme fatale.  A little further from the roots is the impressionistic \u201cIsolate\u201d with its simple but ominous bass line and minimal arrangement. There is also a bevy of rockers like \u201cComplicated,\u201d \u201cFingerprints\u201d and \u201cBelle Parker,\u201d a gem of a song about a hard-hearted woman. The band even finds some excellent middle ground between bluegrass and rock on \u201cFine Excuses\u201d thanks in part to a scorching guitar solo from Adam Aijala. There is also the extended \u201cHonestly\u201d -- at eight-minutes, the longest song on the album, with a middle section that is an excellent platform for lengthier live excursions that are as improvisatory as any electric band on the live music circuit.\n \nThe band is a regular at bluegrass festivals like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and the band's own Northwest String Summit as well as massive multi-stage events like Austin City Limits Festival, Bonnaroo and Rothbury.  Fans are no doubt drawn to Yonder\u2019s anything goes attitude, its humor and passion about music, and the band\u2019s ability to stretch out live.  \u201cWe love that people come to see us,\u201d Johnston points out. \u201cEveryone appreciates good music. Some people want to go to a recital and some people want to party.\u201d\n \nBut as its fans know, Yonder Mountain String Band does something a little different, more than just a musical party. The Show is the band\u2019s most varied and versatile album to date, and the summation of the journey that these guys are on together. It\u2019s bluegrass for the masses, acoustic tunes filled with dazzling chops, and it\u2019s fun to boot. The humble Johnston sounds as surprised as anyone by the band\u2019s success, but knows that it all boiled down to chemistry, which has never changed. \u201cSomewhere down there we all kind of recognized that we had something unique,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut there is no way I could have imagined the amount of success that the band has had.\u201d\n Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Yonder+Mountain+String+Band): 133,792 listeners, 1,662,459 plays  \n tags: *bluegrass, seen live, Jam, jam band, newgrass*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0."]], [[{"comment": "Please be respectful and keep your comments constructive and polite. \nEven if it's not your cup of tea, there is no need to insult the band.

It's the powdered leaf of a southeast Asian tree (mitragyna speciosa) that has very mild and little abusable (for a few pharmacological reasons I could yap all day about) opioid effect that is currently legal in the US. The DEA was about to make it schedule I on September 30th, but so much outcry has caused them to delay the decision, so I'd recommend they buy some now while they can. I've given a small dose, in tea form, to friends who have been detoxing *hard*, and it made *all* of their withdrawal symptoms disappear (for the 4-6 hours of Kratom's duration, but when they drank the tea for the 3 or so days, they stopped having any symptoms at all). There are tons of people that have used kratom to get totally clean, so this is the real deal (also I'm a neuroscience researcher, and could tell you what we know about how the compound mitragynine works. It's very unique, but I don't want to bore you).

Throughout his life, Lo has also assumed the roles of star athlete, convicted felon, Christian, Muslim, and Egyptian resident\u2014and all of these things are reflected in his music.\n\n>  \u201cWhen I talk about religion, sports, winning, losing, struggle, pain, prison, poverty, crime, women\u2014these are the ingredients of OneBeLo, because those are my personalexperiences,\u201d he explains. \u201cI've been a straight-A student, I've been a knucklehead, I've been a heathen, I've been a Christian, I've been a Muslim, I've been a criminal, I've been in the belly of the beast, I've been to the Mecca, I've been to Europe. I've been to the top, I've been to the bottom. I'm talking about everything.\u201d\n\n> Lo was adopted in Pontiac, Michigan, where his mother worked as a beautician and his stepfather worked at a plant. As a result, he developed appreciation for women, fashion, working with a variety of different people, discipline, and forgiveness. He busied himself with over a dozen different activities and attended church several times a week with his family. Life changed once his parents divorced when he was 14 years old. With lower supervision and more exposure to new things, he ran the streets with older kids until he went to prison days after his 18th birthday.\n\n> While in prison, OneBeLo read extensively and converted to Islam, after seeing it wasn't what he was told it was as a Christian child. He also formed the rap group Binary Star with his partner-in-crime  Senim Silla. Despite domestic violence, murder and other drama out of his control happening back home, Lo handled his sentence without losing himself.\n\n> \u201cWhen I went to prison, Allah gave me two and half years to get away from all that weed, all that pussy, and all those distractions,\u201d Lo remembers. \u201cI wasn't going to be like the cats in prison that come back when they're 35 years old. \u2026 I was behind bars, but I realized that the people in the streets were the ones locked up. My mind was free.\u201d\n\n> Upon Lo\u2019s release, Binary Star hit the ground running. On their self-released debut Waterworld, they teamed up with future staples like Elzhi, J.U.I.C.E., and Athletic Mic League to exercise creative concepts and deliver substantial messages. Lo formed a production team with Decompoze, who he had recorded with in high school. Binary Star quickly sold out of their initial 1,000 copies as the album was praised as an \u201cinstant classic.\u201d Though Lo had intended to rhyme anonymously as a solo act to revert attention to the music, he was often addressed as OneManArmy because of a line he used in a song. He and Senim Silla would later go their separate ways, and Lo compiled his Subterraneous Records crew\u2014which consisted of Malaki The Most High, Decompoze, Kodac, Magestik Legend, DJ Phrikshun and iLLite\u2014in January 2000.\n\n> Lo added extra Senim Silla verses and new songs to a Waterworld re-release entitled Masters of the Universe, and continued to focus on touring with Subterraneous and recording several albums\u2019 worth of new music. After showcasing his crew with Waterworld Too, he released Project F.E.T.U.S. as a planned prequel to his debut. The disc sold thousands of copies, and he would later complete his next project, S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M.. He approached Fat Beats Records to press a single to help promote the album, and they gave him a different offer.\n\n> \u201cThey asked me to send them the song I was thinking about using for the single, and I was like, 'If they're doing the 12-inch, I'll let them pick the song.' So I just sent them the whole album,\u201d Lo remembers. \u201cThey hit me back like, 'We don't want to do a 12-inch. We want to do the whole album.\u201d\n\n> Lo signed with Fat Beats for distribution in 2003, and the label asked him to change his name from OneManArmy to avoid legal troubles with a similarly-named punk band. He changed his name to OneBeLo, since he had used that with F.E.T.U.S. He would later go to Saudi Arabia on Mecca, an Islamic tradition to find one's self. Meanwhile, Fat Beats pushed back S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. until 2005. The album was critically-acclaimed and sold about 12,000 copies within Lo's first few weeks on tour. Shortly afterward he would prepare S.T.I.L.L.B.O.R.N., a 27-track compilation of Lo's released and unreleased guest appearances over original new beats. With two projects in tow, Lo landed tours and major festivals, rocking 160 shows per year between 2005 and 2007.\n\n> Continuing his journey to chase the greater good, Lo moved his family to Egypt to expose them to a non-American perspective. Once he saw personnel changes at Fat Beats when he arrived back years later, he worked his way out of his deal and self-released The R.E.B.I.R.T.H.. Eager to collaborate with producers and use a different sound, Lo collaborated with beatmakers like Lab Techs, Jake One, Memo of the Molemen, and others. The album performed well, but Lo again wanted to change his approach. Rather than use his previous method of recording as many songs as possible and compiling what he thought were the best songs, he decided to sit down and focus on one piece of work.\n\n> That piece was entitled B.A.B.Y. (Being A Black Youth). Much of the album, which features the likes of Freeway, Phonte Coleman, Devin the Dude and others, was lost when thieves broke in and stole studio equipment. Additionally, the label he had signed with, MYX Music Label, dissolved before the record could drop. Lo stashed his latest sessions and began to work on his upcoming album, L.A.B.O.R.  from scratch. The new project takes metaphorical inspiration from animals and occupations, jumpstarts a new Waterworld movement with the LABORhood, and lays the foundation to a crop of other conceptual records.\n\n> \u201cWith this project, I\u2019m staying busy and developing my ideas. I\u2019m going through the pains of L.A.B.O.R. before delivering this B.A.B.Y.,\u201d Lo says. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone stop you from creating your art.\u201d\n\n> Despite L.A.B.O.R. being his fifth solo release, Lo is just getting started.

Not to mention glowing reviews and coverage in Alternative Press, AMP Magazine, and on AbsolutePunk.net\n\n> \"We wanted to introduce I the Mighty and Hearts and Spades to as many people as possible, so we decided to put together a 'track hunt' and make each of the songs available on different social media sites and later on Purevolume.com,\" explains singer Brent Walsh. \"We researched how our fans and friends discovered music online and embraced that by giving them a reason to connect with us (the EP for free) and then we tried to build a personal friendship with each one.\" The band's marketing strategy has been an unquestionable success, with over 3,500 full EP downloads within the first 3 months of release.\n\n> In addition to their high-energy live set, I the Mighty have paired new media intellect with traditional promotion to help build a loyal and enthusiastic group of fans.

It was my first (and long before i had heard of Igorrr).\n\nSimilar to Hallelujah and much of Nostril, Rossz Csillag Allat Szuletett (A.K.A. Suicide Sunday or The Pidgeon Album, in my mind) makes heavy use of classical influence and samples. Particularly Hungarian classical. I find his music much more emotionally evocative than Igorrr, who tends to nail down a motif for the pure musicality of it. But be ready for odd time signatures (mostly 7/4 but check track 9 [Hisz\u00e9keny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o-CCBkxcRM&index=9&list=PL9dThdR6I6dP-aZlN3UDxz1k7ZIfjRPLO) for some delicious and sweet 5/4), as well as breakcore elements that build a much more structured complexity than Igorrr. \n\nAfter that, [Cavalcade Of Glee And Dadaist Happy Hardcore Pom Poms](https://youtu.be/oTCW_q3ZWIc?t=606) , which is a perhaps a bit more... *difficult*. \n\nPerhaps...

That trek took six months and included 30 official shows, plus a number of impromptu performances, and it laid the foundation for what is now a sizable fan base in Fisher\u2019s native Canada. He also has a history of busking in the more conventional manner\u2014whatever it takes to get his music heard. We\u2019re talkin\u2019 grass-roots, interactive DIY to the max with this talented and dedicated\u2014or maybe driven is a better word\u2014young artist. \n\n> Fisher\u2019s new album, Goodbye Blue Monday (released in the U.S. September 18 on Wind-up Records), is a timeless burst of acoustic rock & roll that\u2019s brainy and hook-filled, playful and provocative, all at the same time. Take \u201cCigarette,\u201d which employs the cancer stick as a metaphor for addictive relationships\u2014the enticement, the yearning, the withdrawal and the damage. Or \u201cScar That Never Heals,\u201d which examines the anatomy of heartbreak. At the same time, both are thoroughly infectious tracks with choruses that are, well, addictive. That\u2019s Fisher\u2019s M.O. \n\n> The album\u2019s extremes are represented by the buoyant \u201cHigh School\u201d (a recut version of the single from Fisher\u2019s second album, Let It Shine, which picked up substantial airplay in Canada) on the one hand, and the politically charged \u201cAmerican Girls\u201d and \u201cLay Down (Ballad of Rigoberto Alpizar)\u201d on the other. This is the sort of record that sounds like you\u2019ve been playing it forever even as it explores themes that are altogether unprecedented\u2014and that is no mean feat. Says Hawksley Workman (Tegan & Sara), who produced, played and sang backing vocals on the album, \u201cJeremy\u2019s a brilliant and direct songwriter with a bright soul.\u201d\n\n> As a curly-haired singer with an acoustic guitar, Fisher gets the requisite comparisons to Bob Dylan, while his boyish tenor, dexterous fingerpicking and electrifying hooks eerily recall Paul Simon. \u201cIt was a little weird to hear that sort of stuff at first,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m really flattered that people see those resemblances, and I\u2019m sure that some of the records Simon and Dylan listened to are in my collection\u2014Delta blues singers like Charlie Patton, Robert Johnson, Mississippi John Hurt and Big Bill Broonzy, Alan Lomax\u2019s field recordings, Depression-era stuff. For some reason, I identified with all that old stuff when I was going through this renaissance in my songwriting\u2014it\u2019s what inspired me to continue making music.\u201d \n\n> With one foot in roots idioms and the other in rock, Fisher has an unusually broad palate to work with. He spent by far the greater part of his career playing solo, and there\u2019s a disarming spontaneity to his performances. \u201cI\u2019ve probably done 80 percent of my shows solo,\u201d he says, \u201cand I built my thing on top of that. When I was busking, I shed all the things I\u2019d been doing that didn\u2019t work\u2014it developed my songwriting and my performing, and it built my confidence. I feel like I really came into my own performing on the street, and for a while that\u2019s all I wanted to do. So it\u2019s been a hard road trying to find the right band, and the newest incarnation of my band is starting to feel the closest to how comfortable I am as a solo performer.\u201d\n\n> As committed as he is to having fun, Fisher is totally serious about his mission. \u201cMusic can do a lot of things,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the greatest thing music can do is to make listening to a record the best three-and-a-half minutes of your day, or the best night of your week when you go to a show. It\u2019s an escape from the hum-drum; it\u2019s a drug that\u2019s actually good for you. What I\u2019m really trying to do is relate to people on a human level, and in my songs I tend to gravitate toward the human element of a story. For example, \u2018Lay Down (Ballad of Rigoberto Alpizar)\u2019 is about a guy who got murdered by an air marshal in the Miami Airport, but the viewpoint I use is the fictitious voice of the guy who shot him. So what I\u2019m trying to do is communicate with people, and music is the best way I know how to do that. Music is such a mysterious thing, because it\u2019s pretty much invisible, but a song can convey an amazing amount of emotion.\u201d\n\n> That\u2019s certainly the case with \u201cAmerican Girls,\u201d which boasts another audaciously unsettling premise. \u201cI wrote the chorus and lyrics immediately after reading the verdict on Private Lynndie England, who was the Abu Ghraib soldier who took all the photos with the Iraqi prisoners,\u201d Fisher points out. It was so controversial and got so much attention, and she ended up being the scapegoat, but the verdict got buried in the back of the newspapers because it wasn\u2019t sensational enough, and I didn\u2019t want to let it go by without being documented. That song and \u2018The Ballad of Rigoberto Alpizar\u2019 are both about events that are monumental but not nearly as important as the fact that a certain superstar wasn\u2019t wearing underwear when she got out of a limo. This is a very weird culture we live in.\u201d \n\n> As for the making of that little video with the big impact, well, there was a serious purpose behind that too. \u201cI wanted there to be something out there that was from me\u2014that wasn\u2019t based on marketing\u2014using what I had in my apartment as creatively as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cJust to be out there and relate to people in that way, and say, \u2018Here\u2019s something from me that I made for you. I can\u2019t answer every email, but I want you to know that we\u2019re communicating.\u2019 It\u2019s very important to me to be authentic in everything I do and find a creative way to get it all done. I remember being 12 years old and sending fan letters to pro skateboarders, hoping they\u2019d get to read it and hoping they might write back. So I know what it feels like.\u201d\n\n> A lot of time and effort went into that $60 clip. \u201cThe cigarette was made out of modeling clay,\u201d Fisher explains, \u201cand every frame was an individual picture I took, so it was a very long process, especially posing the cigarette with live people and getting them to do certain things at the same time. It\u2019s pretty involved. Like, you sit there for an hour moving this little cigarette around, and then you push the spacebar and you have 10 seconds of footage, but somehow it\u2019s rewarding. It\u2019s funny, because I\u2019m not all that patient a person.\u201d He pauses for a beat. \u201cBut I\u2019m dedicated.\u201d\n\n> No two ways about that.

One click once to disable CSS for the sub, or downvoting using keys as many RES users do is trivial.\n\nUnfortunately this is the sad truth.

In the early '70s, he recorded an album, Lack of Education, which he released on his own Hotel Records label; while Wright wrote the title tune, the rest of the album was devoted to material popularized by other artists. Wright also released one tune from the album as a single, a cover of Curtis Mayfield's \"Right on for the Darkness,\" backed with his own composition, \"Africa.\" In 1976, he made his way to Nantucket, MA, where he played night spots catering to tourists and vacationers. \n\n> He ended up staying after the summer season was over, and with fewer jobs and time on his hands, he began writing more songs.

It was all but a recollection that started off a new beginning in their lives. Two boys; nothing biblical, no where near epic proportions, just, ordinary boys started out with just a common dream. Amer and Haziq didn\u2019t know much about music. But they can\u2019t get enough of making them. No one told them \u201cHey, that sounds awesome!\u201d or \u201cDude, what are you guys doing?\u201d. To them it was just a calling that when they answered, someone, somewhere said \u201cHello?\u201d. So curiosity got the best of em cats.\n\n> They call themselves cats, cause they don\u2019t have a name yet. Because they think they didn\u2019t need to have one. But like all subsistence, they just had to. They would never know why they call themselves Eleventh Maze at the time, maybe it was like a video game to them, they were trapped and wanted out and there\u2019s eleven mazes they have to go through. Maybe they just wanted to commemorate their same birth dates. Whatever the reason, the name and their sound didn\u2019t get to the dial tone on the other side.\n\n> So Amer met Adam. He was into music, wears t-shirts and washed denim. So they thought what the hey, lets give it a shot. But the numbered maze thing didn\u2019t really work out for them. But they just went along with what they had the time, a dream. With Adam, we found Lucky. Someone with that meaning of a name has got to mean something. And he did. It was all for fun at the time. Word after word, tune after tune, and cigarettes after cigarettes, they found something in common: They had nothing in common. And they love the fact that they don\u2019t. So like any other being, they wanted to name their alliance. They called themselves Theorist. Why? Because nothing would be a fact without a theory. And honest truth, I saw them take a gander at a book about it. Then came in Fikry, the shrewd of the set came into the picture. And they were a whole.\n\n> September 2009, they recorded their first album in Jakarta. A total of 12 songs; all from their life lessons about, love, music and friendship because that is all that mattered to them. So the decision of Lucky leaving was a blow even after they had the honor of having Fik Eka in their group. But the birth gave life to everyone in the band, everyone that appreciate them, and love them dearly. The only thing that they could give back to them is their waves, their frequencies and their decibels. Songs that come from the heart of a boy, but souls of men. \"They turned themselves in, and brought thyself out\" So this is for you. This is it. We are not turning back. Because everything fades, buildings fall, the sky would change. The only thing eternal is what is, is.\n\n> At present, Theorists are: Amer Halim (vocals/ acoustic guitars), Adam Bangun (guitars), Haziq Firdauz (keyboard/synth), Fik Eka (bass) and Fikry Yudhapratista (drums/percussions).

I know that a lot of songs are not composed for a piano, but they do sound good because the piano is a very versatile instrument.\n\nThis piece however, lacks almost everything that makes a song played on a piano \"good\"\n\nI don't like 90% of rap/hip hop, and I hate the lyrics most of the time, but I do enjoy them sometimes when they get played on the radio.\n\nRap tends to follow the same melodic progression through the whole song, this does not translate well to the piano, (And most other instruments) unless the player adds some variation or improvisation on it to make it less repetitive. The difference between playing the same song instrumentally and having someone singing it is that you can more easily add variations or \"flavor\", or \"color\" to the performance by the means of the singer's personal own voice and timbre.\n\nIt also does not help that the song's chord progression is fairly simple, which gives it a monotonous vibe.\n\nI can understand why someone would enjoy this, but as stupid pedantic as it might sound, once you start actually \"understanding\" music (Such as in learning theory or years and years of playing an instrument) the harder it is to enjoy \"simple\" music.\n\nI don't know if I got my point across, though I hope I did.", "id": "d4kdwy9"}, {"comment": "And well you know just to add salt to the wound, it's painfully out of tune.", "id": "d4kjrmb"}, {"comment": "Adding to your last point, sometimes simple music is so good and brilliant that it blows your mind that someone can do do much with so little!

It's difficult to translate such a repetitive pop song to most instruments into a product that is pleasant to the ear, especially when the song itself deviates from standard musical norms that, say, a piano was designed to play.  \"Music\" becomes increasingly easier to make these days, as the wide variety of sounds made with software and the emphasis of vocals in successful records today requires significantly less musical skill than to create the same melodies on a non-digital instrument.  \n\nEdit: No reason to downvote this one considering I gave an apology and answered the question?

Skating Polly takes a minimalist approach to songwriting, with the two largely self-taught musicians (Bighorse plays guitar, Mayo plays a guitar/bass hybrid called a basitar, and both girls play drums and piano) crafting super-catchy melodies mainly by \u201cmessing around with our instruments and figuring out how to make cool noises,\u201d according to Bighorse.

And now I\u2019m going to make an awkward switch out of a 3rd-person biography. Why pretend someone else is writing this when I am? Why lie to you?\n\n> \u201cHow did you come up with the name?\u201d is definitely the question we\u2019re asked the most when we play shows. It\u2019s interesting when we go to explain it to people because for some reason they expect an elaborate story and you can see the hungry anticipation in their eyes as syrup drools from their mouth. My mom likes to think that it\u2019s because she was making pancakes for dinner the night I held the first rehearsal in my basement. I don\u2019t quite remember that being the case, but I\u2019ll give her some of the benefit of the doubt and tell people that anyway. Maybe she\u2019s right, and the inspiration was subliminal.\n\n> I really like band names with catchy abbreviations. Reel Big Fish = RBF, Stone Temple Pilots = STP, System of a Down = SOAD, Red Hot Chili Peppers = RHCP, A Day To Remember = ADTR. I remember sitting down with the band\u2019s first horn players (just two trumpets at the time) for a few minutes and brainstorming some of the stupidest band name ideas you could imagine. I liked the letter \u201cP\u201d in an abbreviation. I think at one point we were set on using the color purple. A minute later, we settled on Stacked Like Pancakes.\n\n> Over the years, SLP has shape-shifted and the band has seen upwards of thirty members in its history. The amount of horn players, the instrumentation of the horns, personnel changes with bassists and drummers, and the addition of a second guitarist are just a few developments to name. We\u2019re not your average garage band. We are musicians, we are perfectionists, and we are performers. We\u2019re not afraid to try stacking the pancakes differently.\n\n> Fast-forward to today. I\u2019ve learned that it doesn\u2019t matter how deep of a meaning or back-story there is with your band name \u2013 what matters most is the quality of the music you create and the connections you make with the people who come out to shows to hear it. The band name is a part of the image, but creating good music and sharing an experience with you matters first and foremost. SLP exists for you.\n\n> When we stand on a stage in front of you, we\u2019re there to deliver a high-energy and high-quality show whether it\u2019s a crowd of five or five-thousand. After you see our show, come talk to us and tell us what you think. Then tell a friend. We came up with the image in 2007 and today we\u2019re committed to fueling our passion. Now it\u2019s your turn to tell our story.

And now I\u2019m going to make an awkward switch out of a 3rd-person biography. Why pretend someone else is writing this when I am? Why lie to you?\n\n> \u201cHow did you come up with the name?\u201d is definitely the question we\u2019re asked the most when we play shows. It\u2019s interesting when we go to explain it to people because for some reason they expect an elaborate story and you can see the hungry anticipation in their eyes as syrup drools from their mouth. My mom likes to think that it\u2019s because she was making pancakes for dinner the night I held the first rehearsal in my basement. I don\u2019t quite remember that being the case, but I\u2019ll give her some of the benefit of the doubt and tell people that anyway. Maybe she\u2019s right, and the inspiration was subliminal.\n\n> I really like band names with catchy abbreviations. Reel Big Fish = RBF, Stone Temple Pilots = STP, System of a Down = SOAD, Red Hot Chili Peppers = RHCP, A Day To Remember = ADTR. I remember sitting down with the band\u2019s first horn players (just two trumpets at the time) for a few minutes and brainstorming some of the stupidest band name ideas you could imagine. I liked the letter \u201cP\u201d in an abbreviation. I think at one point we were set on using the color purple. A minute later, we settled on Stacked Like Pancakes.\n\n> Over the years, SLP has shape-shifted and the band has seen upwards of thirty members in its history. The amount of horn players, the instrumentation of the horns, personnel changes with bassists and drummers, and the addition of a second guitarist are just a few developments to name. We\u2019re not your average garage band. We are musicians, we are perfectionists, and we are performers. We\u2019re not afraid to try stacking the pancakes differently.\n\n> Fast-forward to today. I\u2019ve learned that it doesn\u2019t matter how deep of a meaning or back-story there is with your band name \u2013 what matters most is the quality of the music you create and the connections you make with the people who come out to shows to hear it. The band name is a part of the image, but creating good music and sharing an experience with you matters first and foremost. SLP exists for you.\n\n> When we stand on a stage in front of you, we\u2019re there to deliver a high-energy and high-quality show whether it\u2019s a crowd of five or five-thousand. After you see our show, come talk to us and tell us what you think. Then tell a friend. We came up with the image in 2007 and today we\u2019re committed to fueling our passion. Now it\u2019s your turn to tell our story.

The talent assembled was unmistakable, the sound created was formidable.

It plays like a message in a bottle from Hip Hop\u2019s timeless present to the bizarre post-physical, digital, viral world in which we live. DJ Natural\u2019s production chops have only deepened with time, and the rugged loops of the self-titled \u201cOrange Album\u201d and the live instrumentation of Civil Service have melded to yield a m\u00e9lange of soul, jazz, funk, roots, radical politics, and a sly refusal to bend to the dictates of current fashion.

The album plays like a jazz-era cutting session turned confessional booth, a stylistically freewheeling effort threaded together by moments of revelation, underpinned by fiercely focused production and dominated by stories of journey, moments of transformation, and warnings against coming catastrophe. For TC, the MC is a misunderstood figure, a musical seer, a minor prophet, and reluctant hustler, using words to outwit enemies, trump circumstances, and emerge from the belly of the beast with respect and rent money.\n\n> Highlights abound\u2014Kane returning to his spoken word roots on \u201cDenizen Walks Away,\u201d Qwel giving his early battle rap classics a run for their money on nickel-plated platters like \u201cMy Watch\u201d and \u201cGordeon Knock,\u201d and Qwazaar flexing uncanny musical intuition, anchoring the record with meditative efforts on \u201cPuzzling Thing\u201d and \u201cReflections from the Porch\u201d before pummeling tracks like \u201cBetter Luck\u201d and \u201cOn My Square.\u201d Although the LP is studded with solo shots, crew tracks are the soul of the record. \u201cOn My Square\u201d opens with a flurry of horns before exploding into an array of signature styles\u2014multisyllabic combinations from Qwel, laid-back but incisive chatting from Kane, and a classic Qwa verse full of declarations, threats, and witticisms, all cemented by a Qwel chorus imbued with requisite layers of meaning. Natural\u2019s production evolves with each verse, sliding from Meters style guitars with knocking drums to moody keys with ease.\n\n> The first single, \u201cThe Crown\u201d is a frenetic display of jagged guitars and style-shifting that makes it a perfect complement to the Orange Album\u2019s classic \u201cReinventing.\u201d The name, however, is something of a misnomer. TC have never been interested in being kings. They\u2019ve been griots shouting from the village limits, stoning the village idiots, interrupting thieves, and solidifying sterling reputations as rappers\u2019 rappers, smokers\u2019 smokers, underground Gs, tribal chiefs. There will never be another Typical Cats. They leave the set like five men exiting a burning building, leaving wrecked stages and a catalog of classics in their wake. With their exodus, we find ourselves suddenly grown, having come of age with the culture, standing, as always, at the crossroads. With the music, we move like Gayle Sayers, howl like Magic Sam, see the city like a kid on the project bench, and mark it all down in a black book that will never close. It is what it is. Forever.\n\n> QWAZAAR - A native of Chicago's gritty Low End, Qwazaar strikes from hip hop's essence. Whether the subject matter is inner city or interplanetary, the flow remains untouchable - a percussive yet fluid attack that evokes South Side rain and helicopter blades in a single breath. The content is heavy-a holdover from days when this veteran MC (No Pity/Outerlimitz) had to lyrically slay rivals to earn his sterling rep. \"After the dust settles, witness the blood puddles...\" Lights out, kids. The Q-W-A is here.\n\n> QWEL - You first saw his name dangling a quarter mile up on a suspension bridge from your scratch-bombed window on the Orange line. You first heard that distinctive melodic/abrasive storm of syllables on old Nacro and Scam Artist tapes with inserts printed at the Kinko's. Now the heat's been perfected and this nasty North Side revelation music rebel is out to wake the sleepers. From Ted Turner's devil ass to the so-called competition, everyone and their mama gets dealt with when the kid laces up his boots.\n\n> DENIZEN KANE - From the rum and Coke rumble of Chicago's North Side flow spots to the celluloid veneer of Def Poetry Jam's main stage, Denizen Kane rips the party with a poet's heart and an outsider's eye. Journalistic, impressionistic, real-life and drastic, young Kane's late night Red Line revelations turn into heathen hymns on tape, capturing the moody face of the metropolis in color. How long can a lost one roam until he finds his way home? Listen to your city fall apart through the muddy mouth of an immigrant.

Although short-lived and never formally christened, the show had heads from Roosevelt to the Hundreds stuck on 88.5 FM midweek. In the show's aftermath, from the ashes of countless vinyl crates and echoes of chaotic show-closing freestyle sessions, Typical Cats was born.\n\n> Featuring MCs Qwazaar, Qwel, and Denizen Kane, producer DJ Natural and media assassin Kid Knish, Typical dropped a self-titled full-length album, Typical Cats, on Galapagos4 Records in 2002, and began a relentless campaign to restore a fallen hip hop world to its former promise and glory. The talent assembled was unmistakable, the sound created was formidable. Firmly planted in tradition, unorthodox in invention and possessed of a strength only earned in the furnace of experience, their sound is the future that hip hop's past would have had if its present weren't held hostage by the uninspired and unrepentant.
