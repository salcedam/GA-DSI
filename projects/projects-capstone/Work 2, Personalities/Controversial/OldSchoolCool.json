I don't give a shit about the American state, I give a shit about the Euro-American people. Trump offers a platform for Nationalism, and he probably doesn't even realize it. His victory means accelerationism.\n\nAccelerationism is the concept of accelerating the collapse, his policies would lead to racial division becoming more and more common. His policy on the removal of 30,000,000 illegals could spark a racial war, even if 0.1% of that 30m fought back, that's 30,000 possible insurgents, that could easily start the race war. Not to mention, that his isolationism means the weakening of Israel, he will not care if Assad controls Syria,Hezbollah runs Lebanon or the Ayatollah runs Iran. This weakens Israel, which in turn weakens international Jewry. His isolationism also means he won't care about regime changes in Europe, if Golden Dawn (Fascists) take over Greece or Jobbik (Fascists) in Hungary, he will not care. This benefits me and all Fascists because puppets like Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz would interfere, much like how Clinton interfered in Serbia, they answer to international banks, Trump does not.\n\nTrump isn't a Fascist,National Socialist or even hard line Nationalist. His daughter married a Jew, and converted to Judaism, just that fact alone proves he's not the 'KKK racist Nazi boogyman' you're looking for. But he is a self funding wild card, a wild card furthering the collapse of the cancerous Western governments.

Anyone who thinks about it more will realize that is just something that makes the rich richer. People who can already afford to pay for college up front like that have no problem paying for it. They're just getting more free money paying for their kids college.  \nPeople who can't afford it are still left behind. They don't have the money to pay so they can get the tax deduction to begin with.  \nThis further means that it's the people who can't afford college are paying the budget hole created by giving free college to people that can already afford it, and means the poor are essentially paying for the education of wealthier people while it's still unobtainable for them.\n\nIt makes me so mad that people actually buy into that nonsense.  I love how egalitarian Bernie's plan is whereas Hillary tries to bring up some nonsense about how rich people could also get free public college. First off, they go to private ones.

He was born in the early 60s and didn't come out until the mid 80s because of a bunch of factors. He was obviously gay from a young age. He took dance lessons from a young age and ended up making it is life. Loved his family's horses, had zero interest in boy things and despite my uncle being the same age, they were never close friends. In fact, in the late 70s he came out to my uncle because he was the only person he felt he could trust. His family would immediately disown him if he came out even then. His dad and mom were both super conservative and although his dad allowed the dancing to go on, he got good grades in school, never got in trouble and \"seemed normal\". \n\nJust after college, he came out and for about ten years his family didn't have any contact with him. I never knew he existed until around 1995 when my mom asked my grandma about him. She said that last he knew he was living far away doing his dance stuff with some guy. His parents were telling people he had decided to become a drug addict and they didn't have contact with him anymore. In truth, he was living in Florida teaching dance and living with his partner. \n\nEven now, his mom rarely mentions him. He was on a nationally televised TV show that made the newspapers here and she found out about it and refused to allow her or her husband's name to be printed and this was about ten years ago. He is now back in town, doing the same thing he has always done,p. My grandma seems to feel that besides them being from the old fashioned way of thinking, they are also probably embarrassed they didn't see the signs of him being gay earlier while everyone else around them did.\n\nEdit: I'm going to clarify some things for those who wants to get their dicks in a twist. First off, his love of horses was more than just riding them or general interest. I like horses, I've ridden them, it's fun. He was more like \"crazy horse girl\", putting bows in their hair, show riding type of stuff. The horses they had were for harness racing, he never treated them as such. Secondly, dancing isn't gay and plenty of straight men do it. But even to this day there are stereotypes, stereotypes that are less strong now than they were in the 1970s and 80s. In the 1970s where my mom was from, women stayed home, men worked and gender roles were way more strict. So stop acting like the views of people 45 years ago are my own....

The chain was founded as Church's Fried Chicken To Go by George W. Church, Sr., on April 17, 1952, in San Antonio, Texas, across the street from The Alamo. The company, with its headquarters in Sandy Springs, Georgia, is the fourth-largest chicken restaurant chain behind KFC, Chick-fil-A, and former sister chain Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits.\n\n>In early June 2015, Texas Chicken came under flak in Malaysia when one of the customers complained about the food coming from Church, referring to the brand name Texas/Church Chicken. As Muslims are known to consume halal food, any food which is non-halal is deemed inappropriate for Muslim consumption. Upon clarification from Texas Chicken that the name Church is not related to religion, but rather is the name of the founder, the issue was put to rest. \n\nI wonder why they didn't use the Texas Chicken brand in muslim countries.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%27s_Chicken", "id": "d6jfqao"}, {"comment": "Man, Church's is a brand that I grew up with so I'm personally taken aback that the wiki has to be posted for the majority of folks.\n\nWe can truly learn things from one one another, Reddit.

If you would like some great insight into his personality I suggest watching 'Pumping Iron' which was made before his Hollywood days. It is about the Mr. Olympia competition (highest bodybuilding title). You get a real glimpse into the man he is. Pollitically he is a fiscal conservative but was progressive on many issues like the environment.

We never went around trying to impose our ethnic beliefs on others , though we shared, we never made a fuss if you others didn't like it. We always said we were Americans first. We never flew flags other then USA and we never whined that we didn't have \"our holidays\". Also - growing up - we didn't have school notices in 9 different languages. If you didn't know English or didn't know someone who can you were in tough luck. \n\nWe also respected others. \n\nNow a days, it's a whole different ball game. I notice immigrant families are proud to be \"where they were originally from\" more than being an American. Immigrant families rarely learn English beyond day to day usage because there is not need anymore. Schools give out notices in every language ! \n\nAlso they seem more imposing of their culture on strangers and get easily agitated especially if there is a large group of the same ethnic culture living there. (Kind of like Certain groups that shove their beliefs down your throat and if you disagree you're a sexist, racist, bigot, whatever \"-ist\", or just stupid). \n\nWe have a holiday or a parade for every damn ethnic group or orientation. And since some got em' all the groups want to be recognized now ... I don't think it's possible to cater to every group! We have more foreign and ethnic holidays than \"American\" holidays in NYC now. School days off for everything , and etc.  \n\nNeighborhoods are split into \"ethnic group ghettos\". Many folk bring their culture and impose it on others. Never assimilating or what not, under the guise of \"NYC is a melting pot of different cultures\" \n\nYeah we are, except that the underlying glue that kept us civil was that , \"we're all trying to be American because America is the best country in the world\". \n\nThat's something you rarely hear anymore by the way.

Rather he made decisions regarding a fledging socialist state in the face of increasing tensions with regard to Nazi plans for their own empire, as well as the fact that Russia as a country was emerging from a war which had seen thousands dead, which had seen interference from outside forces in the form of military support and also spies which had infiltrated Russian industrial and military industries. Given the real threat the Nazis presented to Russia, along with the threat Japan posed in the east, Russian leadership and especially Stalin could not be complacent in simply sitting back and assuming Russia could just ride the whole thing out. In this case, threats from both external and internal sources meant Stalin was compelled to act in the interests of the safety of Russian wellbeing. In such a scenario, trust had a limited supply and paranoia, some justified, some not so, was high. \n\nTl;dr: Stalin was protecting Russian interests in difficult circumstances.

I'm also going to hold my hands up and say that my primary focus in communism is Yugoslav communism rather than Soviet. However my point I made in my initial post regarding Stalin still remains- sole responsibility cannot be placed with him, and either way, there is a difference the size of Moscow between an act done with specific intent to cause deaths and the indirect consequences of poor implementation of a shaky series of poor policies. It is no secret that Stalin's attempts to collectivise agriculture were a failure, but the efforts of kulaks, who were disliked even before the time of Stalin, particularly by Lenin, to disrupt and otherwise frustrate the efforts of said collectivisation, should not be forgotten.  \n\nPlus I would also make a point of saying this- people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Every single nation on this planet has blood on its hands, including pretty much every single Western country (my own, the UK, has the 'prestigious' record of having invaded all but 22 of the world's countries). To then act as though somehow the actions of Stalin or any other imagined 'enemy' are in any way different is massively logically inconsistent and smacks of special pleading.

My comments history will show I am not a fan, but short of some travesty committed while in office, she will go down noted as the first female president. Not much else. Her fight is not one for women. It is a fight for herself. Her policies are moderate and not significantly different than her predecessor. Don't get me wrong, I think it is great that race and sex are not barriers that cannot be overcome.  It is amazing. I look forward to a time where they have almost no impact on people's lives. I am just not sure how much she has to do with either of those things coming to be. There are other, more powerful and influential, female world leaders. I wonder where her life would have taken her if she had not had a president for a husband. Her political career only came to life after Bill.

Of course it wasn't, Didion said; all he and his men do is smoke pot all day.  One Friday, she had enough and made Dunne fire them.  The actor shook his hand and said \"Jesus, man, I understand.\"\n\nThe Dunnes spent the weekend trying to find a carpenter to finish the renovation, but no one would touch the job.  They had no choice but to re-hire the actor and his crew.  He shook their hands and said \"Jesus, man, I understand.\"\n\nThirty five years later, Joan Didion's daughter lay dying in Malibu. Didion was at the charter terminal at Newark airport, trying to hire a plane to take her to California. Harrison Ford came in to file a flight plan (or whatever pilots do before they leave) and Didion asked if she could ride with him to LAX, because her daughter was ill.  The actor said \"Jesus, man, I understand.\"\n\nWriting about it later, Didion said this story shows the importance of choosing the right man to do your cabinets.", "id": "d8i3nzm"}, {"comment": "DID HE EVER FINISH THE RENOVATION?!?", "id": "d8i67fk"}, {"comment": "I read that in Hunter Thompson's voice.", "id": "d8i9jqi"}, {"comment": "Rumor has it they're still looking for someone to finish the job.

Nazi aces would claim daily kill counts that literally exceeded the number of the total enemy aeroplanes stationed in their area.\n\nThe closest Allies ever came to this level of inaccuracy were the Allied ground kill totals, but fortunately that was noticed fairly soon after the war that as little as only 1/5 to 1/10 of all the claimed ground kills were real (the whole 'Air Force killed most of the German tanks in France' is completely, utterly inaccurate). \n\n\nThanks to the Cold War though and actions of groups such as [this disgusting collection of filth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIAG) that somehow actually became successful to the point where most of reddit is repeating their lies, well, thanks to these factors we are taught to consider everything that comes from USSR as 'propaganda' whilst ignoring the fact that literally everything in Nazi Germany was lie, including the supposed 'economic miracle' that any historian will tell you was a collection of Ponzi schemes, money printing and utterly unsustainable borrowing that only lasted as long as it did because the Nazis confiscated a lot of wealth from the Jews, from people they imprisoned for political/other reasons and last but not least, mass looting of countries on a scale never seen before.

During the Cold War there was a significant propaganda effort from both the US gov't and the German war vets from FRG (West Germany) to rehabilitate quite a few aspects of the Nazi Germany as well as to spread propaganda to make USSR look bad in relation to Germany, so as to shore up the public opinion both in the US to explain why we're fighting the Soviet menace and in the FRG to explain why FRG needed to make a firm stand against communism because FRG was the bulwark of the Western defence against Soviet armies coming from GDR (East Germany).\n\nI could list at least a hundred pieces of Nazi propaganda we often repeat if I had time and didn't post these comments on a monthly basis.

He\u2019ll tear you up if you\u2019re not excellent, because he\u2019s Alan fucking Rickman. So you\u2019ve gotta know all your lines.

Right. Take mine and let\u2019s get going.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t need it. Go ahead. Try me.\u201d\nSo I turned to the first Jay and Silent Bob scene and fed him Bethany\u2019s lines, and without looking at my script, Mewes delivered Jay\u2019s lines in a letter-perfect fashion.\n\u201cAlright, so you\u2019ve got the first scene down,\u201d I allowed. \u201cLet\u2019s mix it up and try a scene from later in the flick.\u201d\nSo I fed him his lead-in lines from the church exterior scene, and Mewes spits out the Jay responses without hesitation.\n\u201cYou memorized all your lines already?!\u201d I demanded, shocked. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d \u201cAll of \u2018em?!\u201d \u201cYeah. Everyone else\u2019s, too.\u201d \u201cYeah, right\u201d \u201cTry me.\u201d\nI read him Loki\u2019s lines from a Jay-less scene, and amazingly, he responded with Bartleby\u2019s lines. I was dumbfounded, to say the least.\n\u201cYou memorized ALL the lines in the script?!?!\u201d \u201cEven the girl parts.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019re you, fucking \u2018Rain Man\u2019?!
