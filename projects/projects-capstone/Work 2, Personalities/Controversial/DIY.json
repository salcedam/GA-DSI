If it were at all possible for it to fall out of the engine bay/onto me, I would not have done it, and you shouldn't ever either.

I also know that holding a transaxle from underneath is typically dangerous,  but in this case it was not- it is not actually possible to remove the transaxle from the particular car without removing the engine first. It is only possible to move it around within the bay, and it won't even rest on the shaft.

If you can't add structural supports, even nailing another piece of plywood to the back of it will give it a lot more stability.  You'll notice most TV stands do basically the same thing, and hold up pretty well.\n\nEdit: see how this shelving unit gets structure from the back plate?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/i0YOxfu.jpg", "id": "d2g8le7"}, {"comment": "People are being a bit savage. They've got a point but at the same time I'm not going to shit on someone for getting into DIY. I might have started on a different project first, something not permanent to get techniques nailed down. But everyone has to start somewhere.\n\nI'd suggest dressing it up a bit, plywood edges are ugly as sin. Just get some poplar or pine at home depot, its cheap and paints up very nicely. They sell it by the foot, just get some 1x2 and face the front edges, it'll also give a tiny bit of structural integrity but not much, mostly for dressing it up a tad. The pink board is an example http://i.imgur.com/3KDPh6V.png\n\nThe look of your bench is clean and I'm not trying to hurt feelings but that thing is an accident waiting to happen, flat out. This picture illustrates what the problem will be http://i.imgur.com/FLu2nq0.gif There is nothing stopping that bench from racking, someone could get hurt on that quite easily. If you look at the classic wooden fence gate and notice that Z shape? That diagonal board prevents racking, that's it's entire purpose http://i.imgur.com/2EZCVUZ.jpg If a gate racks it doesn't close anymore, if that bench racks someone gets hurt. Since its just plywood attached face to face there's zero integrity there. Like Francis said if you add a sheet of wood to the back that helps because it holds all the boards in reference to each other, but if they're just attached face to face its still quite sketch.\n\nYou can do this http://i.imgur.com/NMdgTO5.png where the blue board is screwed into the studs and then the green board is nailed into it. That provides a shelf for the bench to sit on which gives it some body. I feel like that's the very least you could do.\n\nBUT lets turn this into a learning experience! :D 2 fairly simple but awesome things you should look into for woodworking are Rabbets and Dados, we'll focus on dado joints for this (pronounced like date-oh, or day-dough, not like daddy-o). Made up something in sketchup http://imgur.com/a/3CEY4 Dados will help keep boards perpendicular to one another. It won't stop racking, but it helps give everything structure. These along with rabbets are the basic joints of woodworking if you don't want something to fall apart by just looking at it. http://i.imgur.com/CwXA0Su.png As you see here you basically just cut a channel or a groove into a board. You can do it a lot of ways but if you (or someone you know) has a table saw its pretty quick and dirty. You send it through a few times moving the blade over a little more and you can use a chisel to knock any of the remaining crap out and clean it up.\n\nNow that we know what a dado is and how we can easily make one, here's where they could come in handy on your bench. http://i.imgur.com/jHc8DHJ.png By using a few of them your bench just got MUCH stronger. Once we add the shelf in http://i.imgur.com/Pqypd4V.png http://i.imgur.com/GgEwvLm.png that thing isn't going anywhere. It could hold the heaviest of boots with ease, totally rock solid.\n\nBut as long as we're in sketchup and we're learning lets keep going a bit. For the bench top people will always sit in the middle, thats just where you'll naturally gravitate to sitting. But that's a decent looking gap there with no support, someone could easily put their butt right through that one day, so let's take care of that. http://i.imgur.com/MegMHDx.png http://i.imgur.com/8f1Cdvm.png By putting a support right in the middle where people will naturally sit the bench just became much more durable pretty easily!\n\nRacking is still a problem since dados don't cure everything. So you'll want to either do like Francis suggested and put a back on the whole thing http://i.imgur.com/a8XZqEg.png You'd want to dado that all too just to keep anything from moving on you. But dadoing that will get a bit complex, not super hard, but it can get complicated. You could also do like I suggested before and use a nailer strip to anchor it to the studs in the wall. If it was me, I'd put nailers on the sides, do the back dado panel, and then screw that to the studs as well. If you do that that thing won't go anywhere ever, it'll probably live longer than you (though plywood might delaminate before then).\n\nLike I said, not looking to shit on the wife and MIL, just looking to help out a bit and teach. I wouldn't feel safe having my kids use that, could roll over and break an ankle or something quite easily.

However, there exist an abundance of different receivers and jigs from different manufacturers. For example, the second lower is from [Blitzkrieg Tactical.](https://blitzkriegtactical.com/?view=store&prodID=328)\n\nDisclaimer: This isn't really meant to be a guide, although you're able to use it as a guide if you wish. I recommend finding a different method to drilling the fire control pocket because, as you can see, mine wasn't the best. \n \nI know you're not supposed to mill with a drill press. They're not made for taking side loads and it's possible to gravely injure yourself doing this, however not likely. Best case, the press breaks. Worst case, the press breaks and kills you. I took that chance and came out with two functioning lowers. Your mileage may vary. If you decide to take on this project, good luck. \n\nAdvice: \n\n* GET A VISE. If not for safety, for how much easier it will make the process. I purchased [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RTKFWU?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) and it made milling the fire control pocket on the second lower much easier, as I could mill straight down into the receiver. For the first, I used just my hands and had a few close calls. Just make sure you get the right size for the table on your press.\n\n* Keep everything lubed up. For this, I used a $2 can of lubricant from walmart. For the second lower, I bought a $2 quart of motor oil and only used a little over an ounce for the entire process. Lubricate the bit _and_ where you're going to be drilling. \n\n* Keep a good grip. For milling the sides of the fire control pocket, you need to use your hands to move the lower around **clockwise** until the reciever wall is flush with the jig. If you go counter clockwise, or do not have a steady grip on the jig, it could get away from you and very bad things could happen. \n\n* Watch videos of people milling these lowers. Before taking on this project, I watched every video of this process I could find. Most of those people have experience with things of this nature and give you other tips throughout. \n\nThere are other ways to finish a lower like this, including getting and actual end mill, or using the [80% arms Easy Jig](http://www.80percentarms.com/products/80-ar-15-easy-jig). Going the Easy Jig route means that you can use a hand drill instead of a drill press. \n\n\n[Completed rifle.](http://imgur.com/a/xarOT)\n\nTo finish building the rifle you will need:\n\n* Lower Parts Kit\n\n* Buffer Tube Assembly which includes the buffer tube, buffer spring, and buffer.\n\n* Stock\n\n* Upper receiver\n\nIf this is your first rifle, it is usually recommended you purchase a complete upper assembly which simply attaches to the lower receiver.

The government, for a long time, had a problem of \"what is a gun\". Obviously, an AR-15 is a gun, but what if I take the barrel, trigger, stock, and carry handle off? Which part is the \"gun\" now? It's like a [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) problem.\n\nThey solved this by declaring that one specific part that all guns have, called the \"lower receiver\", is the gun. You can think of this piece as sort of the \"backbone\" of the gun to which most of the other pieces attach. You can buy every other part of a full gun without being considered to own firearm. But even [*by itself*](http://www.ar15news.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Umbrella-Corp-AR15-Lower-1.jpg), the lower receiver is considered a firearm. Buying a lower receiver means it has a serial number, the transaction is (usually) tracked, etc.\n\nBut . . . that lower receiver is just a bent-up and drilled piece of metal. You can build one yourself! Hell, you can 3D print one yourself. Since the ATF doesn't restrict citizens *making* firearms, you don't have to put on a serial number, report it to the ATF, or anything. And you can buy pieces of metal. You can even buy pieces of metal that are all bent to the right shapes! As long as it's not totally finished (ATF says 80% is the line), you can buy pieces of metal that are *almost* a complete lower receiver. \n\nSo without anyone really concerning themselves too much, you can buy:\n\n* all the pieces of a firearm (barrel, stock, shoulder thing that goes up) **except** the lower receiver\n\n* a bent up piece of metal that is almost, but not quite a functional lower receiver\n\nOnce you have these, it's just a bit of careful drilling and finishing to have a fully complete firearm! \n\nNow, the question is: why would anyone do this? Mostly to see if they can. They aren't making a machine gun, they aren't making an illegal firearm . . . they aren't making anything you couldn't buy at any decent gun store. It's just a fun activity, I guess.

Thus it needs to be 'automatic' and strongly consistent. \n\nFor firearms it is mostly a tax issue on the Federal level, believe it or not. States usually don't have any rules like this.\n\nFor automobiles they are more concerned about stolen vehicles and EPA requirements (because Federal funding is tied to caring about EPA rules). The Federal government doesn't care so much about automobiles on a individual level... so with automobiles it's trickier then firearms because you have many different states each with their own set of rules. \n\nNow keep in mind that government rules rarely make any sort of logical sense. The rules are designed to fit within a pre-existing bureaucratic law context and are thought up by committees... few of which have any sort of engineering background.   So to avoid breaking the laws and getting something like a car legally registered requires just plain memorization of the rules based on what area of the country you are in. If you try to depend on any sort of logic it's pretty easy to end up running into severe roadblocks.\n\nSome states just require you to have it inspected by a Sherif or other LE representative and keep track of receipts to prove nothing is stolen. If LE thinks it's safe enough for public roads you are good to go.\n\nOther states say that any modern car, including kit car, needs to conform to EPA requirements... which is nearly impossible for a individual to do.... However if you make it _resembling_ a antique car (aka 50's hotrod) then it's ok to have a smog-pumper.\n\nSome states may be easier to register a car if it's based on a production car so you can re-use the VIN number.

I recommend finding a different method to drilling the fire control pocket because, as you can see, mine wasn't the best. \n \nI know you're not supposed to mill with a drill press.

I took that chance and came out with two functioning lowers. Your mileage may vary. If you decide to take on this project, good luck. \n\nAdvice: \n\n* GET A VISE. If not for safety, for how much easier it will make the process. I purchased [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RTKFWU?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) and it made milling the fire control pocket on the second lower much easier, as I could mill straight down into the receiver. For the first, I used just my hands and had a few close calls. Just make sure you get the right size for the table on your press.\n\n* Keep everything lubed up. For this, I used a $2 can of lubricant from walmart. For the second lower, I bought a $2 quart of motor oil and only used a little over an ounce for the entire process. Lubricate the bit _and_ where you're going to be drilling. \n\n* Keep a good grip. For milling the sides of the fire control pocket, you need to use your hands to move the lower around **clockwise** until the reciever wall is flush with the jig. If you go counter clockwise, or do not have a steady grip on the jig, it could get away from you and very bad things could happen. \n\n* Watch videos of people milling these lowers. Before taking on this project, I watched every video of this process I could find. Most of those people have experience with things of this nature and give you other tips throughout. \n\nThere are other ways to finish a lower like this, including getting and actual end mill, or using the [80% arms Easy Jig](http://www.80percentarms.com/products/80-ar-15-easy-jig).

You can't take it off, you get stabbed eventually, and as someone stated, it starts to smell like old pennies very quickly.\n\nI also tried making a version that you could take off by braiding the strings together and adding a loop on one end.  Still using the unwrapped bronze to keep it from coming apart.  You can use a little hot glue to cover the sharp tip.  To close the bracelet you put the loop around the ball end.

I had no idea this post would have attracted the amount of attention it's ended up getting so far. This was meant to be a small project to really make better use of the space inside the room and add a little bit more of some much needed functionality. I obviously can't reply to each and every one of you so, I'll just make this as blanket as possible. My observation is that there are three kinds of people commenting on my thread so far.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say THANK YOU to anyone who has commented in a positive manner about this project. Those of you who have done so clearly have the ability to look past imperfection(s) to recognize the intent behind the labor and recognize a complete body of work. Encouragement is a thing that is always received well and I'm glad people like you all exist. Unfortunately, there aren't more of you guys around to spread this kind of positivity.\n\nSecondly, thanks to all who have responded critically, but making sure to do it constructively and also, with the utmost safety in mind. These suggestions are certainly noted and the proper steps to correct them WILL be taken. As far as the computer goes, I fully understand the risks involved and have taken the precaution of backing up my data via Rsnyc. I'm savvy to the point where I've custom built all of my desktops from scratch and have designed my own home network. Disaster Recovery is fully on my radar in this scenario and has been accounted for reasonably.\n\nLastly, those of you who have offered nothing in exchange except for hostility, negativity, jabs and barbs- let me ask- What have you built? How many of you have picked up a power tool, how many of you have really gotten your hands dirty? How many of you can re-create what I've done? I understand that this post is fair game & I wasn't looking for- nor did expect the all thumbs up, but the negativity just was getting a bit ridiculous. You all are the type of people to only look down and tear down on what others do, but never have the imagination, ability or talent to even attempt the things you see others do. The kind to see a co-worker succeed and pick apart the parts that they didn't do well. I could get vulgar on y'all, but I won't even waste any more time. The words I'm reading from you are a reflection of your insides. Somebody asked if I was butthurt- I ain't butthurt, but there's PLENTY of other DIY posts to look at.

I had no idea this post would have attracted the amount of attention it's ended up getting so far. This was meant to be a small project to really make better use of the space inside the room and add a little bit more of some much needed functionality. I obviously can't reply to each and every one of you so, I'll just make this as blanket as possible. My observation is that there are three kinds of people commenting on my thread so far.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say THANK YOU to anyone who has commented in a positive manner about this project. Those of you who have done so clearly have the ability to look past imperfection(s) to recognize the intent behind the labor and recognize a complete body of work. Encouragement is a thing that is always received well and I'm glad people like you all exist. Unfortunately, there aren't more of you guys around to spread this kind of positivity.\n\nSecondly, thanks to all who have responded critically, but making sure to do it constructively and also, with the utmost safety in mind. These suggestions are certainly noted and the proper steps to correct them WILL be taken. As far as the computer goes, I fully understand the risks involved and have taken the precaution of backing up my data via Rsnyc. I'm savvy to the point where I've custom built all of my desktops from scratch and have designed my own home network. Disaster Recovery is fully on my radar in this scenario and has been accounted for reasonably.\n\nLastly, those of you who have offered nothing in exchange except for hostility, negativity, jabs and barbs- let me ask- What have you built? How many of you have picked up a power tool, how many of you have really gotten your hands dirty? How many of you can re-create what I've done? I understand that this post is fair game & I wasn't looking for- nor did expect the all thumbs up, but the negativity just was getting a bit ridiculous. You all are the type of people to only look down and tear down on what others do, but never have the imagination, ability or talent to even attempt the things you see others do. The kind to see a co-worker succeed and pick apart the parts that they didn't do well. I could get vulgar on y'all, but I won't even waste any more time. The words I'm reading from you are a reflection of your insides. Somebody asked if I was butthurt- I ain't butthurt, but there's PLENTY of other DIY posts to look at.

Those packs may have just one or two (in parallel) 18650s, with a small switchmode supply to generate the output voltage. And it's not unknown for one of the batteries to be a shell filled with sand.\n\nI can't recall seeing you using a multimeter? It might still be possible to get that battery pack to work with this. Advantage being, the electronics in it will protect the battery from being discharged into the range harmful to the battery chemistry. While connecting a bare LiPo directly to the strips will probably damage the battery pretty quickly, since it will tend to be used until it's completely flat.

The LED strips on the roll have wires at both ends just for making continuous runs. For your tiles the single end connection is fine.\n\nDo you have some keying mark on the tiles, to show which way they go? If you rotated one 90 deg in one direction it will clip in but reverse power the LEDs - won't light and isn't good for them.\n\n\"smart battery. Doesn't like the LEDs. Thinks it's a short maybe? I don't really know enough to guess. But it turns off after 10 minutes.\"\n\nAre those 12V strips? I see there's a resistor per LED. Assuming 16mA per LED, that's 192mA/tile.  x20 tiles = 3.84A. Well beyond the rating of a standard USB power outlet, but I don't know what that pack should handle.\nWhat is the rated current limit, output voltage and AmpHour capacity of the battery pack? Is it a fixed output voltage type, or has a selectable output voltage? It might be just shutting down due to internal overtemp, or deciding that the load is a fault that needs protecting.\nDoes it come good again after a rest, or is it going flat in 10 minutes? Those packs may have just one or two (in parallel) 18650s, with a small switchmode supply to generate the output voltage. And it's not unknown for one of the batteries to be a shell filled with sand.\n\nI can't recall seeing you using a multimeter? It might still be possible to get that battery pack to work with this. Advantage being, the electronics in it will protect the battery from being discharged into the range harmful to the battery chemistry. While connecting a bare LiPo directly to the strips will probably damage the battery pretty quickly, since it will tend to be used until it's completely flat. At the risk of having people accuse you of marketing, what's the smart battery pack model number (or link to source?)\nDitto for the LED strips, to know their parameters.\n\nDid you open the battery pack? There's a bit of plastic on the bench behind it in the pic, that looks a lot like the typical case clips in things like that. Which often break off while being spudged open. They are designed to not be openable by consumers, since the batteries are kind of dangerous to those not aware of their risks.\n", "id": "d67z5w6"}], [{"comment": "Interesting.

Measure out said length in silver/gold/whatever\n3.  Anneal (soften)\n4.  Bend so ends are perfectly flush (you should be able to see no light between the joint).\n5.  Brush on flux\n6.  Solder\n7.  Heat\n\n", "id": "cz34ps4"}, {"comment": "I'd love to read a how to post from you!

", "id": "cz2z4uz"}, {"comment": "Another recommendation for moissanite, but it really depends on your girlfriend's preferences. You've probably heard a lot about the C's or whatever. But really, good metrics to go by are hardness (mohs), dispersion, and refractive index (I'm not a jeweler but it personally makes more sense to me to go by gemological metrics). \n\nFor daily wear (on a hand) you want a gemstone that is hard enough to endure abuse, which is why a lot of diamond replacements like CZ are less than ideal (8ish on the mohs scale). Sapphires/rubies (same thing) and moissanite are around 9, making them good substitutes. \n\nDispersion determines the 'fire', basically the [little rainbow light effect you see in gems](https://www.gemsociety.org/article/gemstone-dispersion/). This is influenced by the cut of the gem but also by the raw qualities of the gemstone. This quality is usually associated with diamonds but there are a lot of gemstones that exceed diamonds (most are too soft for jewelry)--moissanite being one of them. \n\n\nRefractive index will determine gemstone [lustre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_\\(mineralogy\\)). Traditional gemstones for engagement rings prefer high luster gems but there are certainly lovely engagement rings with [ star sapphires](https://www.googledrive.com/host/0Bz1PJNuLR12qQnFhcy1VcUxjVGM) or [rough gemstones](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0014/2922/products/Unique-engagement-rings-organic-eco-friendly-Daya-Rough-diamond-F.jpeg_copy_grande.jpg?v=1452277247).\n\nIf you think your girlfriend would like something more unique/distinctive then you might have luck with a sapphire gemstone since it gives you a lot of color/luster options. If she's more of a traditionalist then moissanite is a good bet. Take into account her fashion choices and her work/lifestyle. I wear latex gloves all the time for work and needed a ring with a low setting so we worked with our jeweler to get something that I could still wear while I worked.\n\nEdit: My fiance and I picked out my ring together and the when/where/how of the proposal was the surprise. It was really awesome experience to select something together (and it was pragmatic so there's that haha). My initial preferences were way off what I ended up going with as far as style went.

We would use spent CO2 canisters from BB guns wrapped in just enough tape so that they fit the barrel- then lubed with WD40- as a bullet and that sucker would punch through plywood pretty easily.  We were dang lucky one of us didn't catch one of those in the face.  We also shot arrows out of it using a grocery bag as wadding.

Only thing I'd upgrade on that cannon is the BBQ igniter. Move up to multi-point HV spark. Tasers work well, but can make the entire thing illegal depending on the local laws on owning tasers.

I was able to get a consistent 7/8\" spark. I made 3 spark gaps spread down the length of a 2'x3\" chamber. Much more consistent than the BBQ igniter, and more of a \"bang\" than the \"fwump\" common to single spark gap cannons.

Everything in your phone is powered by the battery, there arent different power souces for differnt components. Of course there may be step up and step down for the different components and their required voltages but the source will still be the battery in the phone. You are adding and additional load to the system, whether you notice it or not your battery life will be affected negatively.\n\n\n>Edit 2:  I was a cell bio major, I see the physics gurus are coming out of the woodwork and eviscerating my feeble attempts at explaining circuits.

What I'm going to assume is that your Apple light is in parallel with your backlight and they are both operating at the same voltage, but the Apple light will be drawing less current than the backlight which will still negatively affect battery life.\n\nAnd since you say that the Apple light and the backlight dim at the same time its safe to assume they connect at a PWM circuit which was meant to only have the backlight as a load but must now also support the Apple light.\n\n", "id": "cyk3wd3"}, {"comment": "If you want to find the right answer on the Internet, sometimes all you have to do is post the wrong one", "id": "cyk5gcs"}, {"comment": "It really is the fastest way on reddit.

I think you're right that there are some walls that this masking tape for sure would not work on.", "id": "d4yy229"}, {"comment": "So, I'll say a little more instead of being apparently snarky.\n\nThere are various reasons walls change color over time. One is the amount of UV, and another is the amount of wear (dirt, smoke, grease, etc). You might think it's not getting any sunlight so there's \"no UV\", but UV is pretty unavoidable. It won't discolor as fast as if it were outside, and it won't age as fast if you're a non-smoker, but it will still change color over time. Like I said, anyone who has come back a few years later to touch up a problem on a wall with new paint, quickly realizes that they have to paint all the way to the edges of the wall, because paint just isn't the same color anymore as when it was put up, even if the fresh paint is from the exact same can, or the same color is mixed.\n\nCovering some of the paint *will* keep what's covered from discoloring. The longer it's up, the more noticeable that effect will be when it comes down.\n\nNow, to the point about \"checking areas and they come off just fine\". Please go look on the label of the tape you used; I assume it's masking/painters tape, as it's made to go on/off without residue. There should be a length of time on the tape how long it's meant for. Most painters tape is rated for 2 weeks.\n\nYou checked a few spots, and there was no apparent damage. It sounds like you're assuming there won't be any damage ever, or that your walls are somehow immune to the adhesive curing in the tape, or paint color changes due to UV. You're not going to see the gradual color change quickly in a small area, nor without lots of light and a critical eye.  If you took off all the tape, however, once the natural light hits the wall, it may already be noticeable where the lines were as you move around the room.  Maybe that's OK with you. Usually all of the walls are repainted after a tenant moves out anyway. But you should at least recognize that it's going to occur more as more time passes, and consider that landlords often look for excuses to not return deposits. \n\nTo the point about \"no damage\",  which prompted my previous reply; It honestly does sound like your plan is to peel a little back every once in a while, until you see it take paint off (or something like that). So put yourself in future-you's shoes when you *do* finally see damage: You peel a little tape off, and you notice it's a bit more brittle than before. It comes off with a little difficulty, and a tiny paint chip or two comes off with it. \"Barely too late\", I called it. You'll have to decide on your own if that's better than \"way too late\". It's still \"tool late\" if the goal is zero damage. Now you're faced with the task of taking off alllllll the tape, expecting the little paint chips to come off everywhere, and only *then* getting to see if there's a noticeable color change, to boot. The longer it's up, the more likely it is to happen.\n", "id": "d51et43"}, {"comment": "Thanks for your concern and detailed reply.

Even then wall fade around but not under the paint leaving the image of the tape or depending on the tape you might have the tape stain the wall. If you're really into this idea instead of paint look into those wall decals, those are specially made for this type of situation. I've had the birch tree ones up for a few years and they are still easy to remove (though the walls need to be repainted under them as they've left a shadow but that's not awful considering an owner generally repaints every several years between tenants)  here are some decal stripes you could trim for your purposes https://wallsneedlove.com/pages/easy-stripe apparently they're 20% off today too for the 4th or just google wall decals ", "id": "d4yu96g"}, {"comment": "Ahh.

I'd suggest steel studs over wood due to the heating on the box. Heavy fiberglass insulation between the studs then drywall or plywood sheathing/paneling. Do the same for the ceiling though hold the studs down a few inches and lay batt insulation both above and between the studs for a double layer. You'll probably want to frame out a hole for a small window AC unit and another for a window with screen.

When you replace sections, or lay the floor in the box truck, coat the bottom with some decent sealer (Spar varnish, heavy paint, even something as simple as Thompson's water seal).

The following  is by no means a formal statement from APC, just my own 2 cents and opinions, but that's an old ups you have, originally rated for 725 VA and consumer home level equipment and is what's known as a \"standby\" ups. meaning there is a delay (about 10 milliseconds) from online to on battery. Also the power output while on battery is a step approximated sine wave, not a true AC sine wave. Most consumer electronics work great and are perfectly happy with that. Since it looks like you are using enterprise level blade servers, their power supplies don't like power blips and they are typically power factor corrected (as someone on here mentioned) and PFC supplies don't do very well with step sine waves. You may get it to work but it COULD cause faster wear and tear on your power supplies and cause them to die a lot sooner than normal. \n\nFwiw: it looks like you have some nice servers there, don't cheap out on the protection. Even if you don't buy APC, buy something that's rated for what you have and not going to wear our your equipment or worse burn down your house because the battery you used may be pushing too much current for the franken-wiring and lower power rated UPS. If you wanted to stay with APC you should look into at least a SmartUPS level.

It is a 130 page document that covers all safety aspects of the product, from things as simple as markings, to flammability of plastic enclosures, and wiring methods.  UL 1778 requires that all UPSs comply with UL 60950-1 which is the Safety standard for Information Technology equipment.  UL 60950-1 is a 590 page test standard that covers a variety of equipment you would find in an office environment.  A typical investigation would take an experienced engineer about a week to look through all construction aspects of the product, and another 7-10 days to do a complete round of testing.\n\nHere are a few things that are wrong based only on the photos the OP has provided and me spending only a few minutes looking at them and the standard:\n\n1)  Flammability rating of the battery enclosure is unknown.  Enclosure must be a minimum rating of 94V-1\n\n2) Battery enclosure allows access to hazardous energy parts.  The standard requires that only trained a qualified service technicians have access to hazardous energy parts, and access must be prevented by requiring the use of a tool.\n\n3) No strain relief is provided where the battery cables exit the enclosure.  The cables need to be subjected to a 100N (22.5lbs) push/pull test (repeated 25 times) and the cords shall not be displaced by more than 2mm.\n\n4) Battery wiring is not properly separated from mains (120V) wiring (The standard refers to this as creepage (distance measured across an insulating surface) and clearance (distance measured through air).  the battery conductors are nor secured and pass directly under the 120V buss, I suspect that proper distances are not being maintained..\n\n5) Holes drilled in the top of the enclosure would need to be tested to see if a test pin could be inserted into the holes and contact live parts.  Based on the photos, I suspect that this test would fail.\n\n6) I did not see how the OP soldered the battery cable extensions together, but I suspect that proper mechanical and electrical securement methods were not followed (Creating 2 U shapes in each of the wires, hooking them together,  twisting and then soldering).  A better way would be to use a single uninterrupted conductor, terminal block, or appropriately rated connectors.  Very few standards allow soldering wires together, but I figured I would cut OP a break hand allow it as this is a DIY.\n\n7) Mechanical and electrical splices were made outside of the electrical and fire enclosure.\n\n8) Using inconsistent wire gauge (connecting larger wires to smaller wires).\n\n9) Conductors carrying Hazardous voltage or hazardous energy must not be accessible to the user, or must be \"double insulated\" which requires a measurement of the thickness of the insulation as well as a 2000VAC Dielectric Voltage Withstand (Between primary and secondary circuits) test before and after a 48 hour humidity conditioning test (93%RH at 25C).\n\n10) The battery enclosure must withstand a mold stress relief test.  The actual test temperature is based on the maximum temperature measured during temperature tests, but the enclosure should be subjected to 70C (158F) for 7 hours and should not distort (surprisingly, many enclosures fail this test).\n\n11) The marine battery has not been tested for use in this application, so several tests would need to be done to test the charging and discharge characteristics, and whether gasses emitted during charging were in sufficient concentration to cause an explosion, or leakage of acid.\n\n12) Output short circuit test would need to be conducted (The test can be waived if a proper over current protective device is installed) provided the conductors are properly sized (assuming a 50A fuse, you would need between 8AWG and 10AWG conductors throughout.  I can't tell what size the conductors supplied are.\n\n13) The increased battery size would require a complete re-evaluation of the UPS Control circuitry.  I suspect that most of the components and the printed wiring board are NOT rated to handle such a large battery. EDIT: Thanks /u/WildVelociraptor\n\nThese are just a few of the things I found wrong in just looking at the photos for 2 minutes, and haphazardly going through the test standards.

Deep cycle batteries have heavier plates and are intended to be routinely discharged to a much lower charge state.\n\nYou really, really need a fuse on the battery.  As someone else pointed out, car batteries can be used for arc welding and will set those wires on fire in an instant if they short.\n\nFlooded batteries like this one are also more likely to release explosive hydrogen gas when charged than the sealed batteries the UPS was intended for.  If you're going to use it at all, keep it somewhere well-ventilated and away from ignition sources.\n\nThat UPS is also under-sized to run a server.  It's not designed for more than a few hundred watts load and the inverter circuit may not handle the heat dissipation needed to run a load for more than the short time it was intended to run off of internal batteries.  I've done something similar to this setup but it was with a much larger rack mount UPS kept at less than half of its rated load.\n\nIf you're just trying to keep your WiFi up, you can probably wire your router up straight to the battery (with a fuse!) if it's rated for 12 volts DC.

Also the power output while on battery is a step approximated sine wave, not a true AC sine wave. Most consumer electronics work great and are perfectly happy with that. Since it looks like you are using enterprise level blade servers, their power supplies don't like power blips and they are typically power factor corrected (as someone on here mentioned) and PFC supplies don't do very well with step sine waves. You may get it to work but it COULD cause faster wear and tear on your power supplies and cause them to die a lot sooner than normal. \n\nFwiw: it looks like you have some nice servers there, don't cheap out on the protection. Even if you don't buy APC, buy something that's rated for what you have and not going to wear our your equipment or worse burn down your house because the battery you used may be pushing too much current for the franken-wiring and lower power rated UPS.

Fuck no.\n\n**Good people of r/DIY, hear me!**\n\nWe are a people of grainy process photographs and captions that say \"Damn it, fucked this part up\"; of hand-me-down tools, basic math skills, and gross miscalculations of the time/effort it takes to do shit we see online; of stubby, hapless fingers and gaps in the assembly photos because we were forgetful, or simply drunk! Does this man -- this fancy man with his fancy tools and fancy photographs and fancy lasers -- count as one of us? Or is he an interloper, a bamboozler, a carpet-bagging techno-wizard here to prey upon our respective boners (or wide-ons) for computers so powerful they can murder us with their merest computer-y thought?\n\nLook into your hearts, my countrymen, and see the truth!\n\nStand up for yourself, DIY! Stand up for your beautiful, earnest, imperfect workmanship, and cast out this blasphemer! For otherwise, I must ask: Will we be sold to, even here? Will you let a cognoscenti masquerade amongst our humble band of bumblers? I say: Keep safe this citadel of figuring it out as we go, in which we do things purely for the love doing them ourselves, because what could be more sacred, or more glorious, or more honest, than doing yourself!\n\n**Edit**: My question about the heart of DIY still stands. But in the interest of fairness, and for the good of our shabby souls, I wanted to share a very thoughtful and well-reasoned counter-argument from /u/PsychedelicFish in [a post about my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/459epx/uroderickrandom_passionately_defends_the_diy/czwe7f9):\n\n> I don't really think this comment is entirely fair. From looking through his website (which I found on the watermark on the photos he posted to another subreddit), this is obviously not a professional product advertisement.\n> Given that he has a section of his website dedicated to photography, I think he most likely took those photos himself. These certainly aren't professional product photos. There are clipped highlights on the top of the case in the first photo, and there are visible scratches and dirt on the bottom of his backdrop. In some of the photos (first one after the specs and plans is a good example) parts of the subject are cropped out and there are distracting objects off to the side of the frame.\n> \n> He certainly has access to some fancy equipment, but again, from his website, I'd probably guess he is some sort of design student and thus is able to use 3d printers, laser cutters and CNC milling machines.\n> \n> While this doesn't show the whole process of making the case, he does at least try to show the making of some of the more complicated parts. By the look of most of the components, they were either milled by CNC or laser cut. Neither of these processes can really be shown in great detail, as there's not much to them other than doing the computer design and setting up the materials.\n> \n> Lastly, this isn't even an advertisement. The closest the post gets to advertising is him stating that \"I actually designed this case myself, and am co-owner of the company that sells them\" In other words, \"My friend and I make and sell custom computer cases to make a bit of money\". There aren't even any links to where these cases can be bought, or even to his website, where this PC is described as \"My personal R40 build\".\n\nIf I have wronged a good techno-wizard in /u/p0Pe: Det m\u00e5 du undskylde.", "id": "czvhary"}, {"comment": "Fuckin' people and their melts.

If lithium batteries are full and you keep putting power into them, they produce a quite spectacular fireworks show. Seriously, they'll burn your shit down.\n\nSo, to avoid that, we use charge controllers that monitor voltage and stop charging after they're full. You might be able to find a thing that is setup to charge 18650s in 11V packs. However, I'm betting whatever you find is going to take 120V AC power (Like what comes out of the outlets in your house, at least in America. You could find something similar for whatever power your country has if it isn't America.). And, I'd bet that, while slightly less efficient, that would be considerably cheaper too.\n\nSo, your best bet, if you want to use the lithium batteries is to get [a 100W solar kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JML23X0), [a cheap inverter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003SGJIRO), [an 18650 charger pack or two](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005UAI372), and [a few sets of batteries](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOCCDBK) and just swap them out as needed. 100W solar is the bare minimum needed to keep up with that inverter.\n\nAlthough, it sounds like space isn't really a problem for you. If that's the case, we can simplify it even further. Buy the same solar kit and [a sealed lead acid battery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003S1RQ2S). You can hook the solar controller directly up to the battery output on the controller. The LEDs would hook up to the \"lights\" output on the controller. And that battery will get you closer to 15 hours of runtime. And you'd never have to swap batteries. As long as you didn't have a very overcast day, let dust or snow build up on the panel, or let the battery overheat (heat over 150*F or so kills batteries), that would provide constant light 24/7 until the battery crapped out (it should last at least a year with daily discharges). You could probably even get away with twice as many LEDs with this setup.\n\nAnd, just FYI, there are cheaper kits out there by about $20, but they don't have the lights output on the controller, which you need for the second option. Also, there are better controllers out there for a few bucks more that have LCD displays that tell you if the panels are getting enough sun, what your battery voltage is (which is how you tell their \"State of Charge,\" how fully charged they are). They generally have USB ports too, in case you want to top off your phone or whatever. If you're only using these at night, you'd have plenty of power to charge up your phone and run the lights at night.\n\nI'm sure you'll have more questions, as there's a lot of new info here.

You can do a lot of things to this project to take it from as you put it,  \"tacky pallet crafts\" to sleek modern design.

Vertical slats seem to work good with either the width or the depth of the board as the face. Take some time to sand it nice and smooth and stain it and you will really have a striking screen partition!

You can do a lot of things to this project to take it from as you put it,  \"tacky pallet crafts\" to sleek modern design.

Vertical slats seem to work good with either the width or the depth of the board as the face. Take some time to sand it nice and smooth and stain it and you will really have a striking screen partition!

I sincerely question your lady actually liking the \"live edge.\" I think it's more likely she's just too sweet to tell you it's.....ugly. And sharp, and problematic.\n\n3. The ring is going to rust. Quickly. Mercilessly. Air and moisture are not going to be kind. The rust will transfer to her lovely hands. Clothing. Other people. Her foods. Etc etc. No amount of oiling is going to prevent that if the ring is being worn daily. It's a high traffic area and the oil won't last long.\n\n4. If it were me? I would be so very in love with the idea. I would probably like the ring a whole lot more asthetically without the live edge, but I'd still love the idea and that my guy made it for me. It was thoughtful and sweet. However, the reality of wearing it daily is not a good time. And even just not wearing it is still going to leave it to rust. I think you should memorialize this ring for her.  It will always be the ring you proposed with. And that is special as fuck! But what if you had it encased in glass? Just in a small glass cube. Air tight. Moisture tight. Where it can be suspended and remain exactly what it is.....a beautiful symbol and an incredibly romantic *idea.*\n\nIf you encased it in glass to preserve it, you could then either make her a second ring out of a more forgiving substance, or buy one made of something interesting.

I suspect OP being bombarded with the comments on this thread has stopped reading them. And if not, then perhaps he's highly defensive about them at this point. That pains me. But I'm going to make the comments anyways. \n\n1. Fucking *stellar* idea! I'm a gal that adores unique, intricately different ideas and perspectives. I also love space and all it's emmense wonder. The idea of wearing a space rock, or even just owning one is absolutely fucking awesome!\n\n2. As others have pointed out, the execution of this ring is....not good. I sincerely question your lady actually liking the \"live edge.\" I think it's more likely she's just too sweet to tell you it's.....ugly. And sharp, and problematic.\n\n3. The ring is going to rust. Quickly. Mercilessly. Air and moisture are not going to be kind. The rust will transfer to her lovely hands. Clothing. Other people. Her foods. Etc etc. No amount of oiling is going to prevent that if the ring is being worn daily. It's a high traffic area and the oil won't last long.\n\n4. If it were me? I would be so very in love with the idea. I would probably like the ring a whole lot more asthetically without the live edge, but I'd still love the idea and that my guy made it for me. It was thoughtful and sweet. However, the reality of wearing it daily is not a good time. And even just not wearing it is still going to leave it to rust. I think you should memorialize this ring for her.  It will always be the ring you proposed with. And that is special as fuck! But what if you had it encased in glass? Just in a small glass cube. Air tight. Moisture tight. Where it can be suspended and remain exactly what it is.....a beautiful symbol and an incredibly romantic *idea.*\n\nIf you encased it in glass to preserve it, you could then either make her a second ring out of a more forgiving substance, or buy one made of something interesting. She could wear that ring every day.\n\nJust an idea. I hope you two will be very happy together for many years to come. Congratulations!", "id": "d9gol3o"}, {"comment": "Wow, this is great critique.

If that wall isn't attached securely to the ones perpendicular to them, it could pull away over time.\n\nAlso, what about those perpendicular walls?

Thanks in advance for any feedback!", "id": "d3qjdk8"}, {"comment": "Experienced woodworker here, If you want legit advice and not just praise for your efforts like most people then here goes:\n\nFirst off you used a plan from Shanty 2 Chic. They know as much about woodworking as your average high school dropout does about quantum mechanics. The fact that they pass off their horrible plans loaded with critical errors as woodworking is hugely annoying to myself and all other woodworkers on forums like this.  They aren't the only ones, there are lots of others dishing out terrible woodworking advise, but Shanty 2 Chic is particularly popular.  I feel bad for the newbies like yourself that build them thinking they will last more than a few months.\n\nThat being said here is why:\n\nWood movement. Wood moves (expands/contracts) seasonally with changes in humidity. Unless you live in a desert where it's always dry this will happen.  There is absolutely nothing you can do to stop it, you have to account for it in how you build and allow for it to happen while minimizing any impact on the piece.  On your typical flat sawn lumber this means the boards will get wider in the summer and shrink in the winter.  Shanty 2 Chic completlely ignores this like it doesn't happen.  One of the biggest no no's in woodworking is to frame in a solid wood panel.  You did that on the top.  When you contrict wood movement like that it either cracks, warps, or pushes the piece apart.\n\nYour choice of materials.  You used construction materials from a home center.  Again Shanty 2 Chic is to blame here.  Construction grade 4x2's etc are cut from low quality very small fast growing trees and are not dried throughly.  That's fine for building a house as it doesn't need to be pretty or straight to build a house, it's hidden.  That's not at all what you want for furniture.  These will move terriblely badly, componding the wood movement issues you already have.  It's also full of resins which can seep out and cause you issues.  It's a crap in crap out issue.  Generally we don't use materials like these in woodworking.  There are certain situations where it's ok, but if/when I ever did that I'd be super selective in what I buy, and I'd let it sit in my shop for a few months before touching it to let it aclimate and stablize first.\n\nYour joinery (pocket screws).  Pocket screws are perfectly legit.  They have a place and I use them sometimes.  The issue with them is that they aren't all that strong and not appropriate for a desk.  Traditional mortise and tensons or half laps would be more appropriate and much much stronger.  More work and harder but still very doable for a beginner.  This combined with the movemement/materials issues I already mentioned means this is even more likely to pull itself apart.  Someone mentioned glue... glue is very strong but it's generally useless on endgrain joints, adding that would not do any good.\n\nYour finish job.  Some people will say they like it, and that's great, but to my experienced eye it looks really bad.  Pine/fir (whatever this is make out of) is a horrible wood to finish.  It's extremely blotchy.  The only way to deal with it is really good surface prep (like anything you finish), that can be sanding (properly!), hand planing, card scrapping, or some combination (not done at all here), and to use some sort of conditioner/blotch control first, a gel stain (usually with a conditioner first too), or a finish like shellac that's not absorbed (unevenly, thus blotches), or just use some sort of paint.  Stain is also is != finish.  Stain is just one of many ways to add color.  You'd apply a finish afterwards to provide some level or protection and a sheen.  Stain alone is very lifeless and offers no protection.\n\nI know this is supposed to be \"rustic\" but falling apart isn't that.  There are ways to build a rustic piece properly so that is lasts structurely if even it gets some abuse.  Hopefully you'd get some useout of this before you have serious issues and know more for the next time.

Still, very impressive."], [51, "Alright, first of all, it's a pretty decent attempt, especially for someone with little anatomy experience.\n\nLet's talk about the type of burn I *think* you're going for here, a 3rd degree, full thickness burn. For reference (obviously NSFW): \n\nhttps://figures.boundless-cdn.com/1744/large/burns-foot.jpe\n\nThis first image shows how someone is going to look very soon after a nasty burn. Notice that the skin is blackened only in patches, and that there is inconsistency in the burn damage (this is especially the case in thermal burns or electrical burns where the clothing is ignited).  The other thing to notice is that even at this stage, there's dried blood around the edges, but the wound is mostly dry, and almost all the exudate is clear or pussy, rather than bloody.  This is important, if you have a 3rd degree burn, the blood vessels are likely cauterized.\n\n\nhttp://r3.emsworld.com/files/base/image/EMSR/2013/01/16x9/640x360/full-thickness-burn_10848638.jpg\n\nThis is a person who has been in the hospital for some amount of time. The burns have been cleaned (as much as is reasonably possible, it's incredibly painful), and the tissue is starting to die. There's no dry, bark-like char anymore, all that black is dead tissue, eschar. Everything is wet, and everything is either slowly healing or quickly dying.\n\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y0ymd1qGHuY/VbT42-MdP5I/AAAAAAAAPrM/6KdK__O882s/s1600/_DSC0303.JPG\n\nHere's an electrical burn, but it's helpful because it shows what's under the skin. Notice the yellow fat globules, the \"silverskin\" or connective tissue wrapping muscles and muscle groups that will be torn and incomplete.  You can also see distinct layers of the skin here, all the way down to the basement membrane.\n\n\nhttp://84d1f3.medialib.glogster.com/media/2c/2c9e148541b033e7ea39c0242ec22fff6e68b33c919c0c07007c78a4ecd6a950/m3350010-dressing-of-third-degree-burns-with-amnion-spl-jpg.jpg\n\nThis is another example of the inconsistent depth and severity of (especially thermal) burns.\n\n\nTakeaways: \n\n* You're doing great, keep up the good work!\n\n* Work on your borders, they're too large and fade too abruptly between types of damage.\n\n* Take some time to understand the anatomy of where you're depicting a wound. Is there lots of fat? Superficial bones? What about muscles in the area?\n\n* Burns are inconsistent. Damage is all over the place, have some areas of relief inside areas of damage. Maybe they had a watch on, or maybe an ember popped off and burrowed into their skin for a while.\n\n* Burns are broadly damaging. You're unlikely to have burns down to the bone at your wrist and a happy elbow, and digits (fingers and toes) will be blotchy, and sometimes pale as lots of the blood supply is cut off. \n\n* Think about how you respond to heat. Let that guide burn placement. You're much more likely to have burns on the palm side of your hands and arms than the dorsal aspect (you throw up your arms to block your face or stick out your hands to catch your fall) \n\n* Depending on how acute the injury is, there may be little chunks of burned stuff in there. If I fall hand first into a fire, you can bet I'm going to have coals stuck in my hand.\n\n* A final note: stretching a burned area is incredibly painful, the victim will want to keep that area in a \"shortened\", protective position. An easy way to get your models/actors to follow this rule, and make your burn look more realistic is to start with a base layer of athletic tape pulled tight. This will keep them from moving normally, and make the effect more complete.\n\n\nhttp://lifemakerfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/480-burn-stephane.jpg\n\nSo apparently this is makeup, good enough to fool me at first glance, I figured I'd leave it up as a shining example of professional work.\n\nI'll probably think of more later, but that should give you a nice starting point."], [18, "better have a physician look that up bruh"], [18, "Am I the only one who sees the random crotch in the last two pictures?"], [12, "At the first picture I thought you were going to set your arm on fire."], [10, "Where do I find various colors of blood?"], [9, "Definitely get yourself a stippling sponge, and 1ply toilet paper.

This is literally makeup 101 from when I took the class, \"out-of-kit\" makeup. \n\nTear up the end of makeup sponges to create an organic texture rather than a smooth square sponge end.\n\nCarefully unroll cotton balls into thin sheets. Feather the edges of each panel of cotton and create organic shapes throughout. These are your cotton \"appliances\".\n\nStipple liquid latex onto your skin and apply an appilance, stipple more latex on top and stipple out onto your skin fully encaplulating the cotton. Don't leave any heavy areas of latex that will take long to dry. Use a hair dryer to speed up the drying process.\n\nPaint light to dark, use reference for the type of burn you want. Apply your solid base color, then use dry brushing techniques to proceed with other colors. The texture you styled and sculpted in the cotton/latex will pop out using the dry brush technique.\n\nYour palette will be in the blood reds, not bruise purple. Add a very faint flush of red around the surrounding area to imply first degree burn outside the heavier damage, don't go past where you've stippled latex or the color will be different on your real skin and highlight the edge of the appliance.\n\nThe last paint step is to gently apply extremely dark brown with some black with a very faint dry brush technique to the highest parts and around the edge.\n\nFinally, adding a little KY jelly to raw areas will make for a puss and weeping effect.\n\n[This](https://chazvance.carbonmade.com/projects/4895780#2) is some of my earliest work circa 2005. It has errors but will give you an idea. This was done with makeup gelatin but the theory is the same.\n\nIt's important to realize that these colors and textures simply splashed onto a person will have a dramatic effect on most people. To move beyond that and into the artistry, you have to break traumas down technically and pay very close attention to your forms, colors, and technical aspects.

From there, it's all paint, though I'm not sure if grease is the way to go. \n\n\nLike someone else said - you need to study your anatomy.

", "id": "d1jgbf7"}], [{"comment": "Alright, first of all, it's a pretty decent attempt, especially for someone with little anatomy experience.\n\nLet's talk about the type of burn I *think* you're going for here, a 3rd degree, full thickness burn. For reference (obviously NSFW): \n\nhttps://figures.boundless-cdn.com/1744/large/burns-foot.jpe\n\nThis first image shows how someone is going to look very soon after a nasty burn. Notice that the skin is blackened only in patches, and that there is inconsistency in the burn damage (this is especially the case in thermal burns or electrical burns where the clothing is ignited).  The other thing to notice is that even at this stage, there's dried blood around the edges, but the wound is mostly dry, and almost all the exudate is clear or pussy, rather than bloody.  This is important, if you have a 3rd degree burn, the blood vessels are likely cauterized.\n\n\nhttp://r3.emsworld.com/files/base/image/EMSR/2013/01/16x9/640x360/full-thickness-burn_10848638.jpg\n\nThis is a person who has been in the hospital for some amount of time. The burns have been cleaned (as much as is reasonably possible, it's incredibly painful), and the tissue is starting to die. There's no dry, bark-like char anymore, all that black is dead tissue, eschar. Everything is wet, and everything is either slowly healing or quickly dying.\n\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y0ymd1qGHuY/VbT42-MdP5I/AAAAAAAAPrM/6KdK__O882s/s1600/_DSC0303.JPG\n\nHere's an electrical burn, but it's helpful because it shows what's under the skin. Notice the yellow fat globules, the \"silverskin\" or connective tissue wrapping muscles and muscle groups that will be torn and incomplete.  You can also see distinct layers of the skin here, all the way down to the basement membrane.\n\n\nhttp://84d1f3.medialib.glogster.com/media/2c/2c9e148541b033e7ea39c0242ec22fff6e68b33c919c0c07007c78a4ecd6a950/m3350010-dressing-of-third-degree-burns-with-amnion-spl-jpg.jpg\n\nThis is another example of the inconsistent depth and severity of (especially thermal) burns.\n\n\nTakeaways: \n\n* You're doing great, keep up the good work!\n\n* Work on your borders, they're too large and fade too abruptly between types of damage.\n\n* Take some time to understand the anatomy of where you're depicting a wound. Is there lots of fat? Superficial bones? What about muscles in the area?\n\n* Burns are inconsistent. Damage is all over the place, have some areas of relief inside areas of damage. Maybe they had a watch on, or maybe an ember popped off and burrowed into their skin for a while.\n\n* Burns are broadly damaging. You're unlikely to have burns down to the bone at your wrist and a happy elbow, and digits (fingers and toes) will be blotchy, and sometimes pale as lots of the blood supply is cut off. \n\n* Think about how you respond to heat. Let that guide burn placement. You're much more likely to have burns on the palm side of your hands and arms than the dorsal aspect (you throw up your arms to block your face or stick out your hands to catch your fall) \n\n* Depending on how acute the injury is, there may be little chunks of burned stuff in there. If I fall hand first into a fire, you can bet I'm going to have coals stuck in my hand.\n\n* A final note: stretching a burned area is incredibly painful, the victim will want to keep that area in a \"shortened\", protective position. An easy way to get your models/actors to follow this rule, and make your burn look more realistic is to start with a base layer of athletic tape pulled tight. This will keep them from moving normally, and make the effect more complete.\n\n\nhttp://lifemakerfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/480-burn-stephane.jpg\n\nSo apparently this is makeup, good enough to fool me at first glance, I figured I'd leave it up as a shining example of professional work.\n\nI'll probably think of more later, but that should give you a nice starting point.", "id": "d1jggbc"}, {"comment": "Thank you so much for the thought through criticism and tips!

As mentioned, all of the blood vessels are cauterized on the surface of your skin. You have very quick swelling, so the wounds more often appear dry and tight. Think overcooked chicken breast.  The wounds are also generally not very charred unless they are DEEP (I've only seen real charring when I can also see tendons/muscle/bone), but there can be some soot on the skin.  The first and second pictures capture what full thickness burns actually look like pretty well. The electrical burn you link to looks like it has already been debrided. Electrical burns usually have an entrance and exit point where the electricity arcs through the body with much more extensive internal damage vs cutaneous (maybe a deep wound to your hand, where you touched the wire, and your leg, where the electricity exited your body).  They don't always look to severe at all at first glance (then you start peeing out blood/muscle and we have issues, as well as cardiac/nerve/bone damage). \n\nSo yeah. Like I said, I think overcooked chicken with yellow, dry skin is more of what you should shoot for if you're trying to be realistic.\n\nEdit: Just to add what you are saying about pain and movement... Full thickness burns around joints do not usually move well, but that is because of how much edema there is present around the wound. It's just too swollen. It's not usually painful, as the nerves are all dead.  Later on in the recovery process when you have fresh nerves growing back is when it's veeery painful (but also super important to keep moving for rehab so you don't get contracted skin).

I also have no idea where the other wound is for that patient.\n\nAnd for movement, at least in my experience with PT, proximal to the injury is extremely painful even on day 1, and only gets worse as nerves start to regrow.

This is literally makeup 101 from when I took the class, \"out-of-kit\" makeup. \n\nTear up the end of makeup sponges to create an organic texture rather than a smooth square sponge end.\n\nCarefully unroll cotton balls into thin sheets. Feather the edges of each panel of cotton and create organic shapes throughout. These are your cotton \"appliances\".\n\nStipple liquid latex onto your skin and apply an appilance, stipple more latex on top and stipple out onto your skin fully encaplulating the cotton. Don't leave any heavy areas of latex that will take long to dry. Use a hair dryer to speed up the drying process.\n\nPaint light to dark, use reference for the type of burn you want. Apply your solid base color, then use dry brushing techniques to proceed with other colors. The texture you styled and sculpted in the cotton/latex will pop out using the dry brush technique.\n\nYour palette will be in the blood reds, not bruise purple. Add a very faint flush of red around the surrounding area to imply first degree burn outside the heavier damage, don't go past where you've stippled latex or the color will be different on your real skin and highlight the edge of the appliance.\n\nThe last paint step is to gently apply extremely dark brown with some black with a very faint dry brush technique to the highest parts and around the edge.\n\nFinally, adding a little KY jelly to raw areas will make for a puss and weeping effect.\n\n[This](https://chazvance.carbonmade.com/projects/4895780#2) is some of my earliest work circa 2005. It has errors but will give you an idea.

Cheap brands tended to die in 1/10th of the time. I own UHE22 and although it is a corded power drill, it's been extremely useful and powerful.

If you bring a block of ice into your room, as it melts and warms up to room temperature, it absorbs that heat from its surroundings including the air. Running a fan and a pump might speed up that process but all of that power ultimately converts to heat and heats your space. So, there's cooling by introducing the ice to the dorm room and heating from running additional equipment. \n\nBut, a complicating factor is comfort! Running a fan makes you feel cooler, because of convective cooling - - long story short, the air, still cooler than your skin, pulls away heat but if it's not moving the air right around you warms up. If it is moving (thanks fan!) it replaces that layer of warm air with cooler air. It also makes the air pick up heat from your skin faster. So the fan does cool you off when the air is blowing on you, even though it heats the room up while doing so. So,  when the fan is pushing room temperature air at your hot body (interpret as compliment if you wish) it cools you down, and when it blows cold air at your body, it cools you down a little faster. By the way - - those of you who run your ceiling fan while you're out to keep the space cool, knock it off. It doesn't help when you aren't in the air flow stream.\n\n(how the hell do I make a stand alone asterisk?) if you made the ice in a freezer in your room, that was a particularly bad idea. Others have explained it well but also think of it this way: cooling something down means *removing heat from it*.

Nothing in there but insulation.\n\nRun your piping into the fridge.\n\nPut a big coil of copper piping in the fridge and connect to the exterior line.\n\nConnect it all up to an in-line pump and fill with water.\n\nNow you are venting your hot air directly to the outside environment and cooling your room without fucking around with state changes and excessive losses to entropy.  It'll be cheaper to run, more effective, and a much more elegant solution.\n\nFailing that you would probably just be better off moving the fridge next to the window anyway.

Please note that this was before the Princess and the Frog Disney movie. Something [kind of like this](https://goo.gl/images/USwzVW), but more tween-themed, not so toddler-y. \n\nAnyway, I personally hated it, because I think frogs are a little off-putting. (I think it's the wet amphibian skin? And the long tongue maybe? I'm perfectly fine with reptiles, I even had a few different types of lizards as pets, even a tortoise for a time, but I just dislike frogs personally). So I hated it, but it was *exactly* my cousin's style, so I told her she should go for it, it's perfect for her. Next month Christmas, I open my primary present from my parents, and it's the COMPLETE FROG PRINCE BEDROOM SET, for me, because they inexplicably had asked my dumb cousin to see which theme sets I liked. I'm not a person who enjoys surprises anyway, I would far rather be involved in the planning of something. But it was too late to return, apparently, so I spent the next 6 years in a room *covered* with frogs. Frog prince sheets, frog prince comforter, frog prince curtains, frog prince lamp, frog prince everything. There was even a pretty big decorative frog with a crown pillow.

The frogs are still there, I just eventually got old enough to move out! My parents are very frugal people, and they barely decorated the house when they originally moved in, and they replace things only if absolutely necessary. So, as a very special treat, they got me that bedroom set when I was 13, and I suspect that room will contain frog decor until they die, because they're not the sort to redecorate an empty room, and while they might not take that stuff with them if they moved, I highly doubt they will ever leave that house. So my old room is now the default guest room, and it must be deeply confusing to anyone who stays there why there is frog everything in an otherwise clearly unoccupied room. As a fun twist, just so you can visualize this properly, the curtains ripped or something when I was away at college, and instead of repairing them or actually replacing them, they just hung up a blue sheet instead. It matches absolutely no part of the frog decorations, which only have a tinge of a very different shade of blue.\n\nI swear, they were wonderful and loving parents, but then again my childhood was also a goldmine of odd stories like this.", "id": "d64f9d2"}, {"comment": "I'm sure they are great parents, they wanted to surprise you and get you something you liked.  \nPlease do tell some stories, I'm intrigued.

From Numbers, 6:22-24. "]], [[{"comment": "As my title indicates, I lost my wife unexpectedly about a month ago. Everything that one could imagine a widower with 2 kids is going through, I am. However I thought this would be a positive way of going through the grieving process. \n\nI had never ever done anything like this before but it didn't seem all that difficult in my mind. Some Google-Fu and what not I found it wasn't. My youngest, my 8 yo son helped with melting and stirring. I did the wax removal and pouring. Safety glasses were used!\n\nIn my minds eye I thought that making this candle would be a good way to remember her, and the special time that we will burn it will allow us to \"smell\" her, or have the house smell like her. She would have loved this as a gift. I wanted to share this as I hope this will help others maybe facing something similar, and to help with my grieving process.\n\nEdit: just checked this at work. I didn't think that this was going to happen. So much love from all of you. I just want to say thank you to everyone for the well wishes, emotion, prayers, stories, links and everything. Just wow and thank you. \n\nEdit 2: I have not had much time to sit down on Reddit. I did spend most of my evening last night reading through each and every comment. I only have limited time for this at my break right now, but I want to say again to everybody who has commented, and or has sent me a private message, or share their stories in particular, that it means so much. This was just a little project, just me my boy did, something that we could do together. Something my daughter appreciates the final result of, and surrounding friends and family love it very much too. I am humbled. This was not expected. At all. I have responded to almost every PM. I have up upvoted almost every comment. The feedback has done one thing for me, in my healing and with my grieving process. Though I am still aching deeply inside from my loss, a lot of these comments, and peoples viewpoints, especially those that have come from people who were children when they lost one of their parents, has lifted a bit of the fog that's in front of me and has given me some clarity on what I need to do moving forward. That is invaluable and something I needed very much. Thank you everybody. I mean it. All of the well wishes and comments and everybody who took the time to post or PM me or even gild me. Thank you so much.", "id": "d0yui8m"}, {"comment": "Look at this project as a metaphor--you take the pieces of your life that you and she made, pull them close and bind them together, figuratively, so that you and your children can be strong as a single unit.

The thread of the screw must of course be suited for the material, but most of the time you're screwing directly into wood or using a plug for things like concrete, stone, drywall, etc. So a wood screw with a countersunk head should work 99% of the time.

In the BDSM community, being \"collared\" is kind of a big deal - It means you're totally submissive to a certain dom full time. The sub isn't allowed to (or in the case of locks like you can use on chainmail, able to,) remove the collar on their own. They need to ask permission from their dom to take the collar off - Depending on the dom, the collar may only be worn at home or with close friends. Others may be more strict and only allow the collar to come off for special occasions, like weddings, funerals, banquets, etc where a collar isn't an acceptable accessory.\n\nAnd that's only a regular dom/sub relationship. There are also petplay relationships where the sub is the dom's \"pet\". That can be full blown furry stuff, or just \"feeling owned and being treated like a subhuman\" stuff. The dom cares about the sub in the same way you might care about your dog - But that sub obviously doesn't get all the rights that a normal person does, (or might have to earn those rights through being good/have them taken away when they misbehave.) That can be anything from \"no TV or Internet after dinner\" to \"not allowed to eat at the dinner table, and being forced to use a dog bowl on the floor instead.\"", "id": "d6p2ok0"}, {"comment": ">restrictions \n\nWhat are some of the most strictest ones you've encountered/seen/heard about?", "id": "d6p4e7q"}, {"comment": "I dated a girl who was into a strict slave/owner relationship. She wanted pretty much *everything* controlled. \n\nShe had a night job, but I controlled her finances. If she wanted to buy something, she had to ask me first. The *only* exception was gifts/surprises for me.\n\nShe wasn't allowed soda or junk/fast food. She was kept on a pretty strict diet, and got punished if she cheated. I even directly ordered for her when we went out to eat. The server would come up and ask if we were ready to order - I would order for both of us, while she sat there quietly. And she had to eat whatever I ordered for her. If she was good, it would be something she liked. But if she was bad, she'd be choking down something she didn't like.\n\nShe enjoyed feeling sexually used, which meant I could take sex whenever I felt like it, regardless of whether or not she was in the mood. Of course we had a safeword, but she never used it - She would whine, complain, and pout, but never directly refused. Everything from having her blow me under my desk while I played video games on my computer, to waking her up in the morning with rough anal, (because she slept on her tummy.) If we had the space for it, (it was a tiny flat,) she would have slept in a dog kennel instead of the bed on days when she was bad.\n\nShe was spanked/pinched/whipped/etc when she was bad, and she loved when I left visible welts and bruises. One of my more creative punishments was simply putting adhesive  Velcro strips (the scratchy side) inside of her favorite bra, and making her wear it all day. At first she didn't think it would be that bad, but by the end of the day she was crying and begging to take it off, swearing she'd never use curse words again, (she had cursed at me during an argument. I immediately bent her over my knee and went to town spanking her, then disappeared into my room to get the Velcro when my hand got sore...) I tied her hands up overnight and made her sleep in the bra. In the morning I took the bra off and slathered tiger balm (basically IcyHot without the icy) on her (now beet red) nipples, before clamping them. It was funny watching the look of relief turn into horror when I took the bra off of her then pulled out the balm and clamps. Funny thing... That bra wasn't her favorite anymore, even after I took the Velcro off.\n\nAnd probably the most restrictive, I even controlled her bathroom habits - She wasn't allowed to pee without asking permission. If she was bad, I could simply stop allowing her to pee for a while. She'd be sweating bullets, rocking back and forth in her chair with her legs crossed, then I'd set a glass of water in front of her and order her to drink it. She would. She actually did wet herself a few times... Which she secretly loved, because she was also into humiliation. She was turned on by being embarrassed and made fun of. I made sure to occasionally poke fun at her about wetting herself, in a \"there's no way I'm letting you forget this\" kind of way... For instance, I actually had her listed as \"bedwetter\" in my phone after she mouthed off a few hours before bed - I told her she wasn't allowed to pee until sunrise, then made her drink a quart of water.\n\nThe list goes on, but that should give you a pretty good example.\n\nEdit: And to answer the inevitable \"But you weren't with her 24/7. How do you know she was good when you were away?\" She would legitimately feel guilty for breaking my rules, and would end up tattling on herself sooner or later. It was cute in a pathetic kind of way.\n\nEdit 2: Also, I feel it's worth pointing out that although lots of the stuff on that list *did* involve sex, it wasn't really **about** the sex.

Bending a tube like OP does two things, it crushes the cross section making it extremely weak and likely to buckle and up you have essentially yielded the material and it is about to crack in half from the gross deformation.

Each node should have at minimum 3 tubes leaving the node, and ideally those 3 tubes leave it 3 different directions. If you build a properly triangulated space frame, you will get an extremely rigid and lightweight structure.

It creates the same amount of dust but it doesn't kick into the air.. it just falls right to the floor.  Way less mess.\n\nWhen painting, especially on fresh plaster, those \"self priming\" paints are BS.   Sure you *could* use them as a primer, but they cost 10x as much as actual primer.. better to just use cheap primer for a coat or two, then use one or two top-coats of high quality paint.   The other advantage of priming with flat white primer is that you can really put it on fast since you don't have to be careful of the ceiling.  If you're \"priming\" with a tinted paint and you get some on the ceiling, it's a devil to cover with matte ceiling paint.. with primer there's no such issue so you can slap it up as quick as you can.\n\nGreat job!!!\n\n", "id": "d8iofhe"}, {"comment": "Thanks I appreciate it!", "id": "d8ioz6c"}, {"comment": "Something else code wise that is relevant is your egress (escape) codes with regards to your window.

Craftsmanship and quality is really impressive. \n\nIn the back of the garage where you installed the boards going up the ceiling... From what I can tell you removed the beams or joists. It looks like you probably only had to remove one or two, so that's good. I see that you did a lot of bracing. From what I can tell though it doesn't really look like the right parts are braced. You essentially doubled the thickness of every roof member. But the problem I see is that really the dimension you braced is not the dimension that needed strengthening. If you wanted to double up boards for strength they should have been attached below the existing roof members (increasing depth). But that wouldn't have made sense, obviously there's no easy way to attach boards like that. And I see that you do have some useful bracing in there as well. Just saying in my opinion almost all of the bracing you have running in parallel with the original roof members is completely ineffective at taking the worst case loading for the roof. \n\nThe beams running horizontal allow the roof members to act as a truss. Now you have the roof members connecting right at the corner with the wall. That puts a lot of moment in that joint. Think of it as a simple 2D equilateral triangle. Push down on the top of the triangle. Imagine each of the three sides. The diagonals are in compression and the horizontal (beam) is in tension. When you remove the beam that force still has to be transferred somewhere. It will go into the walls. So if there's anywhere you need additional bracing, that's where it would be. \n\nRealistically you could be putting pretty heavy impact loads on the roof. Especially if you regularly Dino up to a weak spot. But really just your normal climbing could cause issue as well. \n\nI don't suggest catastrophic collapse. In all honesty it will probably long outlive its use. If it does experience problems it will be from flexing at the corners where the roof members meet the walls. This could cause leaking and water damage. \n\nBut honestly, great project. Only offering feedback to participate in the discussion. Great work.

From what I can tell though it doesn't really look like the right parts are braced. You essentially doubled the thickness of every roof member. But the problem I see is that really the dimension you braced is not the dimension that needed strengthening. If you wanted to double up boards for strength they should have been attached below the existing roof members (increasing depth). But that wouldn't have made sense, obviously there's no easy way to attach boards like that. And I see that you do have some useful bracing in there as well. Just saying in my opinion almost all of the bracing you have running in parallel with the original roof members is completely ineffective at taking the worst case loading for the roof. \n\nThe beams running horizontal allow the roof members to act as a truss. Now you have the roof members connecting right at the corner with the wall. That puts a lot of moment in that joint. Think of it as a simple 2D equilateral triangle. Push down on the top of the triangle. Imagine each of the three sides. The diagonals are in compression and the horizontal (beam) is in tension. When you remove the beam that force still has to be transferred somewhere. It will go into the walls. So if there's anywhere you need additional bracing, that's where it would be. \n\nRealistically you could be putting pretty heavy impact loads on the roof. Especially if you regularly Dino up to a weak spot. But really just your normal climbing could cause issue as well. \n\nI don't suggest catastrophic collapse. In all honesty it will probably long outlive its use. If it does experience problems it will be from flexing at the corners where the roof members meet the walls. This could cause leaking and water damage. \n\nBut honestly, great project. Only offering feedback to participate in the discussion. Great work. ", "id": "d3cgrgs"}, {"comment": "This is the type of feedback I was kind of hoping for!  I had a structural engineer help out a bit, and since adding proper trusses wasn't terribly feasible we went with running parallel 2x4's to try and do whatever we could.  Your argument is 100% valid though.  \n\nI basically ended up sacrificing the corners because we figured we'd already over-engineered the re-worked roof supports in the first place.  We tend not to put too many holds along the corners just in case, and especially nothing huge that you'd dyno to.\n\nI may end up going back and putting some cross-braces in as \"features\" just due to simple paranoia.  Doesn't take much to unscrew a panel and put up more plywood!\n\nThanks for the feedback!  Good to see fellow climbers on /r/DIY :>", "id": "d3ch428"}, {"comment": ">running parallel 2x4's\n\nA good idea, but what you did is use several short sections along the length of a single existing rafter.  Installing a second rafter next to an existing rafter is called sistering.  In your application, every point where you cut the new joist and interrupt it with a purlin relies on the old joist.  It should look like [this](https://minklockaregard.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_1559.jpg).  A properly sistered joist will not completely rely on the old joist at any point.  \n\nImagine a popsicle stick.  You bolt small metal plates to the popsicle stick so that they are touching (similar to what you did).  The popsicle stick can still be easily broken at that seam.  It will probably be fine as long as the existing rafters were in good shape (not rotted or cracked), but good to keep in mind for future projects.  ", "id": "d3cjc2b"}, {"comment": "> If you wanted to double up boards for strength they should have been attached below the existing roof members (increasing depth).\n\nWhile that is one way to achieve increased structural strength, putting the new member next to the existing member is much easier (can bolt the wide sides together rather than the narrow sides) and just as structurally effective as adding it to the bottom.  This is commonly called sistered rafters or joists.  The issue here is that the new structure is several short pieces, which will not add much capacity to the joist.  But roofs are usually meant to be walked on by several construction workers at a time when building it, and again every time it gets new shingles.\n\nHe did add new rafter ties (or ceiling joists, the horizontal pieces) and put them on every rafter, rather than every other.

It will likely help you take better video. But it won't give the same benefits as a real steady cam\n\nA steady cam is a particular sort of mount that uses a counter weight to sift the camera's centre of gravity to a pivot point.\nSee this link for an example http://tiffen.com/steadicamsmoothee/", "id": "da3yksf"}, {"comment": "It's not so much the counterweight, but the weight itself.

Higher mass means it does not succumb to quick movements easily.\n\nYes, that's one element of it. But you're oversimplifying it. \n\nThe expensive stuff also helps with pitch, yaw, etc... so your minute changes of angles affect it less. Combined with optical image stabilization, it makes some very steady images. This matters a lot when you're shooting for production instead of just making \"gopro-ish\" videos.", "id": "da4801z"}, {"comment": "True.

The overall weight plays a smaller role compared to the actual redistribution of the weight.\n\nThe steadicams chief aim is to maximise the moment of inertia as much as possible inorder to reduce the tendency of the camera to pivot on it's mount.\n\nIgnoring weight for a moment, take a pencil in your hand and try twirling it... easy.  Take a long piece of thin wood dowel and try the same thing... very difficult.\n\nSame as when you spin on an office chair.  Tuck your arms in, you spin fast, spread your arms out wide, you slow down massively.\n\nEven lightweight steadicam packages (Merlin etc.) work well because they spread a relatively low amount of weight further out.\n\nSo with the 3 axis gimbal on a properly balanced steadicam (slightly bootom heavy, but only slightly) there is almost no tendency to tip over when moving.  The iso-elastic arm further compensates by reducing the vertical movement through carefully balanced pullies and springs.", "id": "da4fd2q"}, {"comment": "> Ignoring weight for a moment, take a pencil in your hand and try twirling it... easy. Take a long piece of thin wood dowel and try the same thing... very difficult.\n> Same as when you spin on an office chair. Tuck your arms in, you spin fast, spread your arms out wide, you slow down massively.\n\nSpinning isn't really a problem with cameras however.  It is up/down and side to side movement which must be dampened.  The object here is to hold the camera as still as possible while still allowing it to move about using something not so steady, like a human.  Distribution of weight is a non issue when you have a phone or small camera, the main issue still comes back to holding it still, which makes its weight pretty important.  Without much weight it can be shaken quite easily, making the video shake as well.  If the camera is heavy then the shaking can be dampened by your arms.  Too much weight and you'll need a rig to support it so you don't get tired holding only your arms out.", "id": "da4vcdl"}, {"comment": "I'm not saying spinning is a problem with camera's and I am not talking about lightweight camera's specifically, I'm just using an example we all know to demonstrate the principle behind a steadicam, and how it moves almost equal amounts of weight as far apart as possible in order to increase the moment of inertia.  That is one of the overriding principles of a steadicam.\n\nI can also tell you that a lot of weight doesn't help you much with even big cameras.  I own and shoot with a RED One, and with batteries, screen and various accessories, the total camera package weighs in at about 28 lbs.  If you hold that sucker handheld with the top handle (camera dangling below), the footage you get can be pretty unusable and unstable, even with all that weight.\n\nUse a proper handheld/shoulder mount or steadicam however, and most your problems go away.\n\nWeight does help a little bit, but not much.  I have a ton of experience in this.\n\nThe key thing is to either have a good rig like a steadicam, for movement, or if you are going handheld, a decent handheld rig.  The overriding tip that every old salty cameraman will teach you, is that you need 3 points of contact minimum to properly stabilise a handheld camera.\n\nIf that guy who built the rig above were to add a pole sticking out the back that could prod into his shoulder, he'd have a very effective lightweight stabiliser.  3 points of contact, again.\n\n", "id": "da648yi"}, {"comment": "I don't believe you.

If you are a professional it's not \"DIY\" just because you did it at home or used your business workshop after hours.\n\nOff the top of my head the only way I could think to define something like \"Professional equipment\" would be something like; If it needs a specialty tool/equipment and you had to go and buy or hire it, and have no experience with it, then it's probably DIY.

Firms paid a premium price for quality screws. For Robertson, this became a standard in both Canadian and International Markets. His next steps focused on business change to selling to more specific markets, electrical, furniture manufactures and automotive suppliers, etc.\n\n \n\nIn time, P.L introduced a new screwdriver to the market, something that only he could call his own. He created a \u201cHandikit\u201d exclusively and donated hundreds of kits to high school and woodworking classes, plant visitors or anyone simply interested in the product.\n\n \n\nThe market effort of the 1930\u2019s increased sales and by late 1930\u2019s P.L was widely recognized as a major player in the screw business. With almost 200 employees for a small town of 1900 people P.L Robertson became a Milton legend.\n\n \n\nDuring the mid 1930\u2019s, times were tough during the second world war, as P.L Robertson felt the weight of the many hard years, until PL caught a break, the armed services needed tremendous quantities of brass screws and Robertson was there to supply them. In addition, a traveling salesman for Robertson landed a contract where carloads of cadmium plated Robertson combination square/slot drive screws were needed for the plywood mosquito bomber aircraft. This was the largest order ever received by the company. \n\nAround the end of the war PL received a phone call from a change to his financial advisor \u2013 PL was officially a millionaire.\n\nBy 1945, P.L was 66 years old, and became unwell. No wealth could buy him a chance of retirement. His conditions worsened and PL remained at home for the last four years of his life.\n\nPeter Lymburner Robertson died September 28, 1951.", "id": "d03kd0d"}, {"comment": "TIL..", "id": "d03ko3x"}], [{"comment": "Ergonomics be damned, that mouse is really cool", "id": "d03g8r7"}, {"comment": "Still looks more ergonomic than an Apple mouse.", "id": "d03n1df"}, {"comment": "more ergo than a hockey puck imac unit anyway", "id": "d03p888"}], [{"comment": "Jesus, man.
