At my feet lay the Great Central Valley of California, level and flowery, like a lake of pure sunshine, forty or fifty miles wide, five hundred miles long, one rich furred garden of yellow Compositae. And from the eastern boundary of this vast golden flower-bed rose the mighty Sierra, miles in height, and so gloriously colored and so radiant, it seemed not clothed with light but wholly composed of it, like the wall of some celestial city.... Then it seemed to me that the Sierra should be called, not the Nevada or Snowy Range, but the Range of Light.

Moreover, this effect would be compounded anywhere where the galatic center isn't visible. \n\n3)High level cloud over is common in your area. Even a little cloud cover can make it difficult to view the milky way. \n\n4)You did see it and just didn't quite notice! In my experience, particularly when the view is already dim, it's incredibly easy to mistake the milky way for a few clouds -- it's not really coloured, like you see so often in photos, nor is it so obvious and dramatic. \n\nEven if none of the is true, you should find a clear night, a dark spot, and look for the milky way. In my humble opinion, it's more than just a beautiful sight; it frames the world in a scale so vast as to be unimaginable, and leaves with a sense lasting awe.\n\n When one looks to heavens, sees the great expanse of the universe played out before them, and realizes that in all of this they are not only alive but able to comprehend their own insignificance -- and when they realize just how significant that is; that their own existence is a far more incredible phenomenon than the formation of stars and worlds, more improbable than a galaxy, and more delicate than the finest balance, it's hard not to be affected. \n\nApologies for typos, on mobile.

The best part was on our way back as we were racing to beat the storm, a huge flash of lighting appeared and about a mile away we could see smoke. We passed the smoke on our way back and it happened to be a huge dead bush that was quickly burning up.

Just wanted to say YES, do it. I would recommend St George as either a place to retire or to just begin the Utah retirement house hunt. My in-laws retired to St. George and love it and so do I. Here is a copy of a post I sent someone who wanted to know about a vacation at Zion and that general area. It was a copy of an email that turned into a post so forgive the mess but its too much info to type out again ; - )\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSt George/Zion Etc.\n\nThe best times to visit the area are in Late April to Early/Mid May and Mid September to Mid/Late October. That is when the Desert changes the most and the heat is the least and the cold nights have not set in yet. They have almost the same weather patterns we do except their Winters are not as bad as ours but their Summers are brutal. The one nice thing about the heat though is that it is a Dry Heat which makes it much more tolerable. Just beware and drink plenty of water. No humidity means you'll dehydrate before you realize it. Bring good Sunglasses, a Ball Cap or Hat and decent sunscreen too. \n\n\nTraveling to St. George is a rather straightforward matter. I recommend flying into Las Vegas. Once you arrive in Las Vegas it is a simple matter of renting your car and heading straight up US 15 North. It will be a 2 hour trip but it is all a straight line until you reach St. George. Plenty of towns between Las Vegas and St. George too in case you need to make a pit stop.\n\n\nSt. George itself is a little/big town. It has all the amenities of a modern town with fine dining, golfing, entertainment and shopping, while still having an actual town center like in the old times. The State of Utah actually provides a very nice resource website full of the many things you can do so it serves as a nice starting point to see what is around the area. I will cherry pick a few things and list them below so as to wet your appetite a bit. [Click here for the St. George website](https://utah.com/st-george).\n\n\nOh, and don't forget. This is one of those vacations where you will take a ton of pictures. Don't forget to bring the good camera(s) and bring along an extra memory card and/or a laptop to download your pictures at the end of the day.\n\n**( Note: I sent this info to a friend so if you don\u2019t golf it doesn\u2019t matter because the Hotels/Resorts I list are all top notch.)**\n\n\n**Lodging:**\n\n\n\u2022\tSince you like golfing my first suggestion is the \"[Inn at Entrada](http://www.innatentrada.com/about-entrada/welcome.htm)\". It offers spectacular views of the Buttes nearby and is right next to Snow Canyon State Park. It also has a golf course right there so you can wake up, golf and then go hiking. They are fancy and cater to the Golfing/Business Corporate Retreat type clientele. \n\u2022\tA very close second is \"[Red Mountain Resort](http://www.redmountainresort.com/)\". This is still upscale and also next to Snow Canyon State Park but designed around the adventure of it all. They offer or arrange guided tours of the nearby State Parks along with Zion National Park. I'm sure that they could also do Bryce Canyon for you but remember it's about 2+ hours away.\n\u2022\t\"[Coral Springs Resort](http://coralspringsresort.com/)\" comes in at #3. It is just outside of the main town and near Red Cliffs State Park and Quail Creek State Park. You're still \"in town\" but it's in a more \"isolated\" area.\n\u2022\tNOTES: All 3 resorts are very nice and all are in close proximity to fine dining within a 10 minute drive. The town of St. George is spread out a bit and follows the flow of the valleys created by the Buttes that surround it. Driving to and from anywhere is very easy and they have had brand new interchanges provided by the Utah DOT that simplified some old and confusing roadways. Your GPS and/or Google Maps will have no problems getting you anywhere.\n\n**Golfing:**\n\u2022\tThe \"[Inn at Entrada](http://www.innatentrada.com/about-entrada/welcome.htm)\" is first on the list because it is a resort and course all in one.\n\u2022\tHere is a list of [ALL](http://www.redrockgolftrail.com/st-george-utah-golf-courses/) the golf courses in and around St. George.\n\u2022\tI wish I could be more comprehensive but alas, I do not Golf.\n\n**Dining** (I've eaten at all that are listed)**:**\n\n\n**Breakfast**\n\n\n\u2022\t\"[Bear Paw Cafe](http://www.bearpawcafe.com/)\" They have been voted \"best breakfast\" in St. George a few times and they are located in the \"Historic District\" part of town. They do tend to get crowded and parking can be a .... bear..... but it is totally worth it.\n\u2022\t\"[The Black Bear Diner](http://blackbeardiner.com/)\" This is a very traditional American Diner type place and is frequented by the locals. They have traditional American style breakfasts and even though they attract a crowd their parking situation is a bit easier.\n\n\n**Lunch/Dinner**\n\n\n\u2022\t\"[Don Pedro's Family Mexican Restaurant](http://donpedrosfamilymexicanrestaurant.com/)\" An excellent traditional Mexican restaurant with homemade Salsas and Hot Sauces. Makes for a very nice dinner.\n\u2022\t\"[Durango's](http://www.durangosmexicangrill.com/)\" This place is awesome! Homemade tortillas. The food is all amazing and the portions are generous.\n\u2022\t\"[The Painted Pony](https://painted-pony.com/)\" Very nice sit down dinners in a very nice atmosphere. The food is \"fancy\" but not too fancy, Pricey but worth it.\n\u2022\t\"[Rib and Chop House](http://ribandchophouse.com/)\" An excellent Steak House with one of my new favorite cuts of meat. The Baseball Cut Top Sirloin. It's about the size of a large Filet Mignon but the savory meaty flavor of a New York Strip.\n\u2022\t\"[Anasazi Steak House](http://www.anasazisteakhouse.com/)\" Good food and your steak is cooked on a HOT ROCK! Right in front of you....if you want.....or you can have chef do it in back.\n\u2022\t\"[Cliffside Restaurant](http://www.cliffsiderestaurant.com/)\" Spectacular views for Lunch and Dinner since they are atop a Butte that serves as the St. George Airport landing strip. Voted Open Tables Best for 2015.\n\u2022\t\"[Riggatti's Wood Fired Pizza](http://riggattis.com/#!/page_SPLASH)\" Ok, I am spoiled by Jersey Pizza but they do an excellent job of it with several \"artisanal\" pizzas. Great for Dinner with a family.\n\u2022\t\"[Sakura Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi](http://www.sakuraut.com/)\" The Steakhouse side is your typical Hibachi, we cook it in front of you, type arrangement but the Sushi and Dinner sit at a table side is wonderful. Nice change of pace from all that Steak you just had.\n\u2022\tHere is a list of [ALL the restaurants](http://www.visitstgeorge.com/dining-guide-st-george/) in case you want to try other things too.\n\n\n**Dining at Zion National Park**\n\n\nI have only one recommendation as an absolute **MUST**. \"[Oscar's Cafe](https://oscarscafe.com/)\" They serve Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.

The views are unbelievable. The hikes are all easy to do in a 4 to 6 hour day except for two,  [Angels Landing](http://www.zionnational-park.com/zion-angels-landing-trail.htm) and [The Narrows](http://www.zionnational-park.com/zion-narrows.htm). These two hikes are not to be taken lightly. Both have killed quite a few people. The Narrows is a hike up a slot canyon at the end of the park itself. The slot canyon as with the rest of Zion was created by the Virgin River and it is the water that has caught many a hiker by surprise when Rain Storms farther up in the canyon flood the narrows out and trap people. Angels Landing kills thru kindness and carelessness. You are about 1,500 feet up in the air with sheer cliffs on either side. Not for the faint of heart. People fall because they move off of the trail to let people pass and step on very unstable rock outcroppings. If you do go then stay on the trail, hold onto that damn chain and don't let go. Someone wants to pass! Tough shit. They can wait until you get to a turn-out where there is enough room to pass but still stay on the trail. \n\u2022\tThere is also [Horseback Riding](http://www.canyonrides.com/) that is very enjoyable and you'll get to see a few places not many others get to go to.\n\u2022\t[Bryce Canyon National Park](http://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm). /[pics](https://www.google.com/search?q=Bryce+Canyon+National+Park&rlz=1C1CHAF_enUS448US578&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwizxMzNz5rKAhXDPj4KHZuiAU0QsAQIKw)/ Bryce Canyon is an absolutely stunning formation of eroding clay and sandstone.

There's going to be a thick, choking cloud of ash that will be around for a few days. No form of transport will allow you to escape the rain of ash that will occur within minutes of the eruption\n\n2) Thermal ejecta. When a volcano explodes, it throws up molten gobbets of lava and other rock high up, which then comes raining down. Flaming rock bouncing off you and/or your vehicle is not going to help your escape.\n\n3) Shelter space. Not really a good idea. Remember, volcanoes spew hundreds of thousands of tons of lava. In the case of a supervolcano, it is very likely that there will be more than one pyroclastic flow (A gravity-driven cloud of hot ash, lava, and detritus such as trees and other organic material that travels down mountainsides at hundreds of kilometres an hour). These pyroclastic flows will deposit tonnes of ash and rock over a given area making it unlikely that you will be able to emerge from an underground shelter - There will simply be too much in the way for you to open your door.\n\nIn short, you're pretty fucked in the event of a mega-eruption. But that's no different from people who live in the lower ward in New Orleans or live near the San Andreas fault, or live near any of the hundreds of volcanoes around the world\n\nOn the other hand, with a mega-eruption on the scale of what is predicted, you will likely have a relatively large warning window (i.e. a couple of days) as scientists gather more and more intense readings.

I was watching the weather forecasts closely but it's always hard to predict things when you're up that high in elevation. We had plans to take it easy, crack open a few beers and relax as the sun went down, then sleep in our car and wake for the sunrise. Unfortunately that didn't really work out... \n\nWell, turns out I wasn't really looking at the right weather forecasts and it was straight fog/clouds with rain as soon as we arrived. We could barely see 10 yards in front of us. Feeling pretty disappointed and knowing that we'd be trapped in our car for the night, we were very close to making the 2+ hour trip back to Portland. Were we not two of the most indecisive people in the world that debated this for over an hour, we likely would have...\n\nUltimately we decided to stick it out and hope that conditions improved for the morning. Having my laptop and some of our favorite shows to watch helped pass the time. Well, after waking at 4:30am to clouds yet again... things weren't looking good. Fortunately I saw a couple of other photographers arrive and head up the trail at Loowit Lookout so I decided \"what the hell, I'll scope things out at least\". Turns out I knew the dudes and we coincidentally had chosen to shoot the same place that morning. Had they not been there, I probably would have gone back to the car and slept through the morning.\n\nFortunately for all of us, the clouds parted probably 5 minutes before sunrise, allowing us to shoot the wildflowers with a beautiful backdrop of Mount St. Helens. SUCCESS! I would have hated myself had I left and saw my buddy's photos, but in the end I guess it all worked out!\n\n.\n\nTechnical Info (will update when I get home from work)\n\n- Canon 5D Mk II with Canon 17-40mm 4L\n\n- Background: 17mm, F11, ISO100, 0.6s\n\n- Flowers: 8 exposures for focus/clarity (flowers are inches from the lens), 17mm, F9, ISO500, 1/10s\n\n- Induro Tripod, polorizer filter (but not at full strength)\n\n- Processed in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop\n\n.\n\nFor anyone who's interested, feel free to check out my [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/steveschwindt) for more of my photos - thanks so much for reading!\n\n.\n\nUpdate for photo details."], [194, "Wow, you know I usually Don't get wowed by earth porn photos.

I was watching the weather forecasts closely but it's always hard to predict things when you're up that high in elevation. We had plans to take it easy, crack open a few beers and relax as the sun went down, then sleep in our car and wake for the sunrise. Unfortunately that didn't really work out... \n\nWell, turns out I wasn't really looking at the right weather forecasts and it was straight fog/clouds with rain as soon as we arrived. We could barely see 10 yards in front of us. Feeling pretty disappointed and knowing that we'd be trapped in our car for the night, we were very close to making the 2+ hour trip back to Portland. Were we not two of the most indecisive people in the world that debated this for over an hour, we likely would have...\n\nUltimately we decided to stick it out and hope that conditions improved for the morning. Having my laptop and some of our favorite shows to watch helped pass the time. Well, after waking at 4:30am to clouds yet again... things weren't looking good. Fortunately I saw a couple of other photographers arrive and head up the trail at Loowit Lookout so I decided \"what the hell, I'll scope things out at least\". Turns out I knew the dudes and we coincidentally had chosen to shoot the same place that morning. Had they not been there, I probably would have gone back to the car and slept through the morning.\n\nFortunately for all of us, the clouds parted probably 5 minutes before sunrise, allowing us to shoot the wildflowers with a beautiful backdrop of Mount St. Helens. SUCCESS! I would have hated myself had I left and saw my buddy's photos, but in the end I guess it all worked out!\n\n.\n\nTechnical Info (will update when I get home from work)\n\n- Canon 5D Mk II with Canon 17-40mm 4L\n\n- Background: 17mm, F11, ISO100, 0.6s\n\n- Flowers: 8 exposures for focus/clarity (flowers are inches from the lens), 17mm, F9, ISO500, 1/10s\n\n- Induro Tripod, polorizer filter (but not at full strength)\n\n- Processed in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop\n\n.\n\nFor anyone who's interested, feel free to check out my [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/steveschwindt) for more of my photos - thanks so much for reading!\n\n.\n\nUpdate for photo details.", "id": "d4q0bx7"}, {"comment": "Mt St Helens is the site of one of the most magical days of my life. \n\nWhile slowly travelling to Olympia, Wa to return to college after a multi-year hiatus I decided to stop at St Helens for a day of hiking. My dog and I drove in through clouds, hiked through clouds, reached a clearing reminiscent of a moonscape in clouds, could hear a waterfall in clouds. Then, upon climbing a ridge and rounding a bend found ourselves staring at the south side of the Mt as the last cloud drifted off the summit. It was majestic. It was glorious. It was perfect. On the way back down, we got to experience all those same sites, only this time could see the views, and waterfall, etc. Heck, turns out we could even see the mountain from the parking lot.\n\nMy dog passed away 4 years later and I knew where I had to lay her to rest. On the 1 year anniversary of her passing I summited the mountain and scattered her ashes among the ash of the mountain. \n\nI love that mountain and love the hell out of that dog.

So much to do - Petra, Wadi Rum, Aqaba, Madaba, Jerash, great hiking, Feynan Ecolodge is awesome. Lots of nice lodging in cool areas, check out Wild Jordan and Experience Jordan if you ever come. Amman is nice but you need 2 days tops. You can see the Citadel and Roman Amphitheater, eat some food, check out the cool neighborhoods, see Downtown and Rainbow Street. Then see the rest of Jordan. It's a really diverse landscape. Food is good. Price wise it's not exactly cheap. Food is pretty expensive. I mean you can get a falafel sandwich for 65 cents but real restaurants end up being a bit more than the States. Alcohol is pricey but they actually have some good local stuff. Carakale for beer and Mt. Nebo/St. George for wine. Big Arab drink is Arak, kind of similar to Ouzo. Taxis are cheap and we even have Uber now!\n\nJordan is known as one of the more liberal countries in this area. Not sure if you're male or female, but guys can wear whatever. Girls need to cover knees, shoulders, and cleavage. But by no means are girls required to wear a headscarf or cover more unless you enter a mosque. I have before for touristy purposes and everyone is super welcoming. In Amman probably 60% of women wear a headscarf (hijab) and 40% don't, whether they are Muslim or not. Outside of Amman it's probably 95%/5%. I think the Christian population here is about 3%. But Jordan is very tolerant of religious differences, as long as you're not an Atheist, like me! No PDA in the streets. I mean you won't get arrested but it's frowned upon. Also homosexuality is not illegal, but gay people often get other morality related charges brought against them. Jordan just banned a Lebanese band from playing here ever again because their lead singer is gay and the band is open about sexuality and gender equality.\n\nLet me know if you have other questions!

The rock's shadow would be the lower horizontal, and maybe the rock itself would describe part of the left vertical line.\n\nI don't know *how* this trick works exactly but apparently it makes for more dramatic pictures.\n\nKeep up the good work, you have a real talent."], [5, "So beautiful \ud83d\ude0d"], [6, "That's truly beautiful.

The lighting is perfect.\n\nI'm in no way qualified to offer you any expertise but I'll repeat something I read recently on the subject of photography in case you find it helpful:\n\n>[The Rule of Thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds) is a \"rule of thumb\" or guideline which applies to the process of composing visual images such as designs, films, paintings, and photographs.[1] The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections.[2] Proponents of the technique claim that aligning a subject with these points creates more tension, energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the subject.\n\nSo to apply this rule to your pic, I think you'd actually place the base of the rock off-centre, to the lower left of the picture and have the horizon describe the upper horizontal line (as it already does). The rock's shadow would be the lower horizontal, and maybe the rock itself would describe part of the left vertical line.\n\nI don't know *how* this trick works exactly but apparently it makes for more dramatic pictures.\n\nKeep up the good work, you have a real talent.", "id": "d3oypd6"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d3p0j2y"}, {"comment": "Agreed... always with that damn rule of thirds on these types of posts.

This results moving objects to leave a trail of themselves behind them or water/clouds to appear fuzzy and misty. Fast (short) exposure is used for crystal clear photos of fast moving objects eg. making running water appear like ice or capturing sports/races/animals (\"freeze-frame\"). \n\nIt is a pretty basic function as this and aperture (how wide your lens opens when you click) are the main difference of DSLRs and auto cams, at least as I see it.", "id": "d3p5ihv"}], [{"comment": "http://i.imgur.com/JIZIQRP.jpg", "id": "d3p2nqk"}], [{"comment": "What an awesome shot.
