This has nothing to do with how they play, obviously, but with what they are doing by dodging the 50+1 is disregarding the spirit of the game in Germany. We don't want the premier league in Germany, and thus, we hate this shit from RB Leipzig. \n\nNote that FPP completely applies in all scenarios - the 50+1 is a much more stringent rule and ensures (to some kind of degree) that the finances don't get out of hand, and that football isn't purely a corporation billboard. \n\nLeicester on the other hand, plays in the premier league. You have gazillionaire owners pouring money in, some doing so pre-FFP, some doing so post-FFP and getting around it in various ways. This isn't new, this isn't even all that frowned upon in the grand scheme of things (who bats an eye anymore when Chelsea/Man City pays 50 MM gbp for an average defender?) Lets not forget Leicester's record signing, I believe, was their Japanese forward for less than 10 MM gbp, something like that. \n\nThere's a clear spirit in German football to be a club owned by the members, with some exceptions. But these exceptions weren't ruining the game, and they had been around for enough time for it not to be a problem. E.g. Bayer is worth in the several billions, but they aren't pouring unreasonable money into Leverkusen. \n\nRB Leipzig completely goes around this, by 1) not being a club run by members, and 2) dodging the 50+1 investment scheme after the Bundesliga decided it didn't want anymore exception clubs. \n\n\n\n", "id": "d9of3u2"}], [{"comment": "If I'm not mistaken, and from what I know, they're pretty disliked because they were bought by Red Bull and all the money lead to them buying up a bunch of promising young players, and people don't like the way they're structured.", "id": "d9nbzgh"}, {"comment": "That's like half of the reason.

Whereas in sports or any other skill in life, if you dedicate time to learning something, you can greatly improve at something, maybe even get good at it where it's no longer a weakness?\n\nIt's like in the NBA for example, you see many examples of players lacking in being able to shoot the ball from 3 pt range.

Once the problems died down with Zidane being appointed, he was in a comfortable system, and showed his goal scoring ability that led his team to 2 trophies(essentially), and his country to another.

In my opinion, he is the best goal scorer, has incredible position, and greatest header in the game, and his passion is unmatched; meanwhile, Messi is the greatest passer and has the best ball control I've ever seen.

So he makes Messi a permanent false 9. Again, great success follows.\n\nAfter Barca had gone a bit stale, Enrique started to play him on the RW again, something we still see today, and last season he was the best dribbler by far in all of Europe, and this season he is the best passer.

Simple fact of the matter is, no matter how bad the Browns are, they still already have a couple of players who are truly elite - Thomas, Haden, arguably Alex Mack - and if they strike lucky on a quarterback, they can go from also-rans to contenders overnight.

Use some common sense and you will realise that it is not prevalent in the Premier league at least. I can't be bothered going into details for the 100th time about this but these names Ferdinand, Kolo, Paddy Kenny and Sakho. They all received harsh bans for doping. Sakho not as harsh but he literally did nothing wrong. Why did those 4 players randomly get done for doping but nobody else? If doping is prevalent then why did those 4 get such harsh punishments. Fair enough Kenny whilst probably ignorant of it did actually dope. Kolo Toure got punished for taking weight slimming pills! Weigh slimming pills! Now they may contain a substance which is included under doping but the point is he received a harsh ban and didn't purposely dope. Sakho was accused of taking a similar product, turns out he broke no rule or law but was being threatened with a 2 year ban and still missed a large part anyway. Rio did not have evidence of doping. He missed 9 months simply because he missed a drugs test. The FA are that keen to prevent doping that they banned one of Englands best players before a tournament simply because there is the possibility that he doped. He had the same possibility of doping as any other player in the country but because he missed a drugs test one day he missed 9 months of football.\n\nWhy did Rio, Kenny, Kolo and Sakho all get such harsh bans if doping is so common, especially considering none of them even 'properly' doped. Why would the FA give Rio Ferdinand a crucial player for England such a ban with no proof if doping is everywhere? The players practically had a civil war with the FA, they were very close to refusing to all boycotting the national team,  I don't think they would have gone through with it (Neville might have) I think most were bluffing but still the very fact that situation happened and the FA stuck to their decision shows they are determined to eliminate doping. Why did Sakho get such a harsh punishment for literally doing nothing wrong?\n\nI can't speak for other countries but there is not a shred of evidence to suggest doping exists in England. How comes literally no player has ever come out and admitted to illegal doping in English football. Now don't get me wrong I reckon a lot of top teams do what I call 'legal doping', they take substances and in the case of Spurs practice blood spinning, all ways believed to improve performance of players. But ultimately these are legal, as long as they are legal it is simply not doping. I think a lot of people (not saying you) like to act like people who don't believe them about doping are naive but honestly I think the people who believe doping is so common are the naive ones. If people look into it instead of just parroting it then they would realise it probably isn't the case.", "id": "d6v1rzb"}, {"comment": "> Why did those 4 players randomly get done for doping but nobody else?\n\nThey didn't get \"randomly done\", they were the only ones who were caught or who failed to turn up to the test or who took (or allegedly took) banned substances but weren't aware and so could hide it. \n\n> The FA are that keen to prevent doping that they banned one of Englands best players before a tournament simply because there is the possibility that he doped.\n\nBeing \"keen\" to prevent doping doesn't mean you can. There are plenty of olympians who are able to get past all the test, there are many who have only been caught after doping in 2008. They were 8 years ahead of the testing technology at the time, if footballers have anything like that edge then they'd never be caught.\n\n> He had the same possibility of doping as any other player in the country but because he missed a drugs test one day he missed 9 months of football.\n\nYes and that's what he was punished for. He was punished for missing the test, not for doping.\n\n> Why did Rio, Kenny, Kolo and Sakho all get such harsh bans if doping is so common, especially considering none of them even 'properly' doped.\n\nBecause the FA doesn't allow doping. That doesn't mean they're actually able to stop it.\n\n > Why did Sakho get such a harsh punishment for literally doing nothing wrong?\n\nI don't see how it's relevant that Sakho turned out to be innocent here. He was punished because he broke the rules, the fact that it turned out in the end that he didn't break the rules is irrelevant to the point.\n\nAs I said before, the FA might well be keen to stamp out doping but that doesn't mean they're able to.\n\n> How comes literally no player has ever come out and admitted to illegal doping in English football.\n\nHow many players want to be the first to stick their hand up and admit that they're cheats? To potentially have to give up medals and to face consequences for doping? We know doping is rife in other sports but how often do you see an athlete who hasn't been caught publicly come out and admit to doping?\n\nAll you've argued for here is that the FA wants to eliminate doping. That's fine, I agree with you. That doesn't mean they can actually catch people. As I've mentioned, we know in other sports with more stringent testing that people can get away with doping, it's only once technology advances and samples are retested years later that many athletes are caught. \n\nHonestly I do think it's a little niave to think there's no credible chance that doping is popular in football when we know that people can get away with it.

That's ridiculous, the rule is that the best third place teams go through, I really don't see how if they qualified to the knockouts by the rules then it wasn't deserved.

It doesn't matter how attractive you played, how much possession you had, or how many shots you had on target.

The team that scores the most goals, the winning team... is not always the better one. \n\n By your logic, every single game ever played was won by the better team since they scored more goals...

It's the reason games are exciting to watch because anything can happen at anytime. A stroke of individual genius, or an amazingly lucky moment can make for a surprise ending. Just because one team ends up winning doesn't make them better. its just completely silly to say that the only measure of how good a team is how many goals they score.. Thats not an intelligent assessment at all. Of course its the only metric that matters IN TERMS OF RESULTS, but not in terms of determining WHO WAS BETTER. \n\n The thing is that sometimes inferior teams get the good results. And thats a good thing. Its what makes every game a competition and a fight. The important thing to note is that just because an inferior team wins, doesnt mean they dont deserve it. It might sound like thats what I am saying, but it's not. Whoever manages to pull off the win, definitely deserves it.

I'm talking about who was the better team on the day, which in my mind can only be Portugal because they were the ones who won without cheating France and without some random stroke of luck (like the beachball incident I already mentioned). But what I'm saying is that the point of football matches is to determine who was the better team on the day, and the metric by which that is determined is goals scored. It is not a commentary on the overall talent or ability of a team, or of how attractive they played, it is simply a determination of which team was more effective at the end of the day. The entire point of football is to get the ball in the back of the net, no matter how attractively you play, or how many chances you create I fail to see how you can say you are the better team if you have completely failed at the single most important method of determining which team was the better team. Also, of course I believe in upsets, I would call this last final in upset. In my mind an upset is when one team is better on paper but ends up losing. However, I would still call the less talented team better on the day if they won, even if the sum of their talent is less. \n\nI guess basically what I'm trying to say is when I say Portugal were better than France I wasn't commenting on whether Portugal are better than France as a squad or in terms of talent, I'm just saying that in this particular match Portugal were the better team.

And I think this final was the perfect example of how so many games played out. This is obviously just my opinion, but I think most people do not want to see the death of attacking football and the rise of defensive wins. I do not blame Portugal for playing this way as they were victim to it in 2004 and you play any way you can to win, but its hard for me to call a team better, when they refuse to engage in open play and instead center their efforts completely around preventing the loss over going out and getting the win. I think when attacking football wins, it gains much more respect and validity.   \n\nBut yes I can understand how you might see that type of tactical playing as being better.

The transportation. Match/friendly scheduling. Large percentage of player selection. Manager selection.  \n  \nAll of these have been going wrong. Ever since the death of Grondona, the former president, AFA has been very poor and even more corrupt. With Grondona, the AFA was corrupt but strong, now, it's corrupt and weak. In a vote for the new president, where there was an \"electoral college\" of sorts, made up by 75 people, there was a 38-38 tie. The issue? 38+38=76, meaning that something was amiss. More is explained [here](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/04/argentina-football-association-election-farce).  \n  \nFirst, the NT has been getting screwed over, transportation-wise. Argentina had an extra day of preparation heading into the final, which would have helped a lot for resting and healing, however, it was spent on a plane because of all the delays. Messi [complained about it on Instagram](http://www.espnfc.us/argentina/story/2900898/lionel-messi-calls-argentina-federation-a-disaster-after-flight-delay), and although the AFA declared that it was weather issues which caused the delays, they were unable to offer any alternative, forcing the players to waste one whole day of preparation on a plane instead of the 4/5 hours it would take normally from Houston to NJ. Moreover, from Messi's protests, it is clear that transportation issues have been re-occurring constantly.  \n  \nSecond, international friendly schedules. 2 weeks before Copa America, Messi was injured in a friendly against Honduras. This caused him to miss the first group stage match and come on as a sub in the next two. Playing against such obviously physical opposition two weeks before a major tournament is very risky, and although we can attribute some blame against Gerardo Martino for having him play more than necessary in such an unimportant match, it is not a good idea to risk injury with matches as unnecessary as those. This maladministration with unimportant friendly matches has occurred often, another frustration.  \n  \nThird, manager selection/association. Sabella, who I think is one of the best managers Argentina had in the past few years, left immediately after the WC Finals, citing issues with the AFA in terms of player selection and many of the issues Messi protested. Had Sabella maintained his position, and used his 3 years of preparation with the same/very similar squads, we could have played a lot better in CA 2015, won that, and even won CA 2016. That the team played well in CA 2016 is less attributed to Gerardo Martino's managing and more attributed to the hunger the players had for an international tournament victory. Even so, the AFA has had issues with the manager in not paying his salary for three months. Now, no-one wants to coach Argentina because of the issues they could have with the AFA.   \n  \nMessi and co. are extremely tired of all the AFA bullshit, sentiments which have hit an all-time high because of the rigging of the presidential elections for AFA. Messi and co. are constantly being stopped--not by the opposition's defenders, but by the AFA's incompetence. Failure to schedule appropriate travel schedules, failure to take into consideration the health of the players by scheduling stupid international friendlies days before a major tournament, failure to deal properly with managers. It all adds up.    Messi \"retired\" because the shitstorm will only get worse if a serious message isn't delivered, and Argentina could fall as a footballing giant.  \n  \nPlaying for your country is playing for your national football federation, and when that federation is completely incompetent, your national team suffers as a result.

Attendance alone doesn't tell the story, but the ticket prices and sponsorship involved in the game, tv audience figures.\n\nMaybe here from the UK I wouldn't watch a women's us team game even if it was against England, but I might watch Argentina vs brazil men's game. As a result you pack out a stadium and get 1mil income, but barely 1mil more people watch it on tv in the US or around the world and that only brings in 1mil more because the tv rights are worth next to nothing precisely because no one watches.\n\nNow Brazil vs Argentina might get 10mil people in Europe, 50mil in South america, 2mil in North America, 10mil across the rest of the world watching that game, the rights for the game are worth dramatically more because they know so many more people will be playing. As such while they make 500k from ticket sales, they make 15mil from tv rights sales to that single game.\n\nThis is why women's football has a lack of money, outside of high stadium attendance(potentially) due to the women's national team being actually successful, it still holds next to no interest to anyone but american fans and even there women's football is hardly the most followed sport.", "id": "d7a42ne"}, {"comment": "> Which may be true\n\nIt's not, average attendance at men\u2019s games from 2011-15 was 33,471, more than double the attendance at WNT games during the same period.

Most youth players don't make it as regular starters for a Champions League club, players like Emmanuel-Thomas, Lansbury and Afobe aren't going to get you into the Champions League, or into cup finals, or challenging for titles. \n\nWenger is a shrewd spender, and English players are simply poor value, why over pay for someone purely because of their nationality? \n\nWenger has shown that if a young player is good enough he will play them, it's not an issue of nationality, if young English players aren't starting for Arsenal it's because they aren't good enough. \n\n"], [353, "Upvoted for some interesting points but I disagree. Wenger has had a profound effect on English football for the better. I'd say only their hapless medical record has held back their young players, who by the way have won more in the past 2 years than Spurs have in their last 30. So I'm not sure what parameters you're defining 'successful' with.\n\nWenger helped change the attitude towards football in England, it's easy to take for granted now but around 10 years ago young English players were so lacking in technical ability that it was a global embarrassment. There's been a overhaul at youth level and I think the success of his invincibles team inspired that. Chamberlain, Walcott, Wilshere, Iwobi and Chambers have all developed into good players under him despite what some redditors or hack journalists might think.\n\nEnglish football only deals in extremes. There's 1 league place between Spurs and Arsenal and yet one is being held up as the future of football, and the other an abject failure. People need to get a grip. It's like how nobody can praise Alli without bringing up Wilshere, no one can say nice things about Kane without saying Sturridge is shit in the same breath. Such a weird one upsmanship mentality, it's as if people only use the national team as a platform to get one over on their club rivals."], [188, "I'm sorry, but I just totally disagree with this. The reason the players in question haven't done all that well is because they're just not great players. You can't blame Wenger for that. \n\nBuying youth is a crapshoot - some players flourish as they enter adulthood, and some diminish. There is no winning formula.\n\n>In this case though I think Sam Byram will be a much better player because he's played more football - 130 championship appearances for Leeds since 2012 compared to Jenkinson's 80.\n\nFor a start, Jenkinson just isn't an Arsenal quality footballer - that's not to insult him, he just isn't. Now, Byram, I know well (being a Leeds fan). He's a silky footballer, that's true, but he's silky for a Championship club or a decent Premier League club. He's not Arsenal quality in my view (their team is full of technically sound players like Byram anyway). Also, he is not a good defender (currently)! \n\nWe actually didn't play him that often at right back, because he used to get caught out - instead we played him on the right of midfield (and sometimes allowed him to float a bit) to take advantage of his technical ability. It'll be interesting to see how he copes in the Premier League. "], [127, "If you posted this same exact thread about City or Chelsea, teams that actually produce next to zero English talent, their fans would get hyper defensive, down vote it and say 'well all English players are shit anyway so why should we bother'\n\nIt's only because Wenger is low hanging fruit right now that this kind of discussion is being entertained "], [111, "You missed out Crowley\n\nAlso what's the difference between him bringing through a foreign youth talent like Bell\u00e9rin or Iwobi vs an English one? There isn't really one. Youth players will flourish or fail regardless of nationality.\n\nSay Iwobi makes it but Ox doesn't...they're both raised under the same youth system or whatever. Are you saying that because Ox is an Englishman under Wenger, that he's been mismanaged, but why does Iwobi who has declared for Nigeria do well? Is it because he's not English? "], [105, "To say that Wenger 'ruins English talent' is just ridiculously hyperbolic. You can make a point, as you did, that Wenger hasn't brought a large amount of English talent to the club (but surely Wenger/Arsenal are not the only club guilty of relying on foreign talent) but the rest of your argument hardly makes sense.\n\nYou're saying Arsenal have failed at developing Chambo and Chambers. You do realise Chambo is only 22 and Chambers 21? They're hardly at a point in their careers where you can say that their talent was wasted or ruined. Theo is a different story, but Wenger has stuck by Theo for 10 years and its harsh to say its Wengers fault Theo hasn't lived up to the hype.\n\nOther points you seem to be twisting to fit your narrative. Gibbs for example isn't just some guy who sits on the bench and is happy to do so. After Clichy left he was trusted as our first choice LB for two years before an injury and the arrival of Monreal kept him out of the team. Should we expect Wenger to drop a better player just to accommodate and English player?\n\nI think the issue of English players is not just something Arsenal or Arsene himself have, but is generally an issue with the entire league. I'd love to see English talent get more of a chance than they do, and as much as I hate them, hopefully the emergence of English talent at Spurs will demonstrate clubs don't need to look abroad every time they need players."], [105, "Is this the same old guff that resurfaces around an international tournament where England realise the lack of talent in their squad and look for someone to blame? Damn foreign managers won't develop our talent eh? That must be why we are shit.\n\nYou mention loan spells a lot in your post - notice that Chelsea loan a lot of their youngsters out all over the place, yet you rarely see them make it to the first team."], [98, "You're making a few unneeded assumptions, and you've really put the most negative spin on things. There are several points that require addressing:\n\n* First, you're talking about a particularly fallow period of English talent development. What great English talents have any big clubs brought through *in the last 10 years*? Tottenham have Harry Kane and maybe Ryan Mason, Liverpool have Sterling (brought from QPR at 16), Chelsea have Loftus-Cheek at last. In that time, Arsenal have brought through Gibbs, Wilshere, and Iwobi. Not so bad.\n* Secondly, you've made your post without any idea about Arsenal's youth academy or the troubles we've had until now. There was a major lack of investment (curiously coinciding with the boardroom tumult before Kroenke became Majority shareholder in 2011). The period between the youth cup triumph in 2009 (starring Wilshere, Afobe, Ozyakup, and others) and the current crop was particularly dire. For crying out loud, we went 2 years without anyone in charge of youth development before getting Andries Jonkers. Let's call that lot the \"lost generation\". And we underinvested not just in comparison to Chelsea or Man City, but the likes of Spurs, West Ham, Liverpool, and Southampton as well. \n* As to Carl Jenkinson - are you honestly suggesting that championship games are worth as much as playing against Robben and Ribery in the Allianz Arena? \n* As to Kieran Gibbs: he's a solid 6-7/10 player, but Monreal is a 7-8/10 player right now. Form is form, and Monreal has made himself undroppable.  To Gibbs' credit, he's performed *decently* every time he's played, unlike Debuchy for example. But he hasn't been good enough to dislodge Monreal. If he stays for a couple of years (once Monreal slows down, he's 31), he'll likely take the LB spot again.\n* JET: Attitude problems. Everyone has known about his talent, but his attitude was ghastly. Much like Manu Frimpong (at Arsenal from 7 or 8, and who was formidable alongside Wilshere at youth level), his attitude was his undoing. \n* Benik Afobe is one that got away perhaps. But he was allowed to stagnate when the entire youth setup was sinking (relegations, lousy scouting, and so on). Plus, he suffered from a couple of really bad injuries, and lost around 18 months of development because of it.\n* Lansbury: He's a good player, but not nearly good enough for Arsenal, and, as mentioned before, has attitude problems. Even Forest fans will tell you that until recently, Lansbury could be unreliable. \n* To your point about English signings - who should Arsenal have signed? Phil Jones, for 17 million, and compete with Fergie's Man Utd? Sturridge, from Chelsea? Or maybe you mean Adam Lallana, for 25 million, when we already have Cazorla, Wilshere, Rosicky and Ramsey on the books. \n* Continuing with the theme of English signings, you're forgetting Jermain Pennant, who got plenty of chances, and even did ok. Unfortunately, he's a wanker, and it showed with Arsenal and every other team he's played for. Of all of Wenger's English signings, only Upson has any cause for complaint, and even he had to compete with Adams, Bould, and Keown. \n* And as for defenders, please. \"[There] have been plenty of players around the Premier League in last 10 years or so that could have filled the void left by Adams, Keown and Dixon.\" Really. You must not have watched that lot play. There are no English defenders right now fit to lick Tony Adams' boots. The last group who were decent enough were Rio Ferdinand, Terry, Campbell, and poor old Ledley King.\n* Are you honestly saying that Wenger doesn't believe in Theo, Ox, Chambers and Gibbs? Are you nuts? They're given chance after chance (Walcott and Ox in particular) and can never maintain any consistency. Chambers is 21, he'll get his chance. And Gibbs, poor guy, has Monreal ahead of him, who's been our most consistent player this year. \n* \"I'd go as far as saying that Wenger has NEVER been good for English talent.\" Stupid. Stop reading the Telegraph, particularly those wankers Matt Law and Henry Winter.\n* As to the extra reading: The Telegraph has it out for Wenger (right or wrong), and are more clickbaity than ever. The second article is poorly researched rubbish. Of that crop of players, they mention Miquel, Daniel Boateng, Ebecillio and Aneke.  Aneke was a midfielder who had a shot on him, not a striker. Miquel wasn't good enough. Ebecillio... decent but not nearly good enough. Make no mistake, there are \"ones who got away\" from that group. For example, Nordtveit, who captains Norway and starts for Gladbach. Or Ozyakup, who's probably the best player in Turkey this year. \n* As for future youth prospects, we've quite a few right now. Chris Willock should make his league debut next year. Maitland-Niles has already played in the CL. Maybe Akpom can come back into the squad next year also. And Reiss Nelson is the best youth prospect we've had since Wilshere. \n* Also, speaking to the wider issue about youth development, I think you overestimate the importance of the manager. The manager must only make give the final step: a chance in the first team. How many English players have been given a chance over the years (from both within the club and in terms of signings)?

He's a creative player who's best position is no.10 when he sees a lot of the ball, because Ozil's there he plays on the wing and that could become his full time position.\n\n I disagree about the loan thing, unless we bring in another Winger who would start over him. He's seeing a lot of game time at the moment, who knows if he will next season but he certainly will in cup games and should get a lot of PL & CL minutes too if he keeps performing. He's improved so much as he's said so himself, by training with world class players and going to a side battling relegation or a championship side wouldn't be as beneficial for him imo."], [7, "I'm not sure that I agree with you, but this actually seems like a relatively thought out opinion and we should have more /r/soccer posts that are complex enough to recommend extra reading at the end! So I'm gonna try and respond in kind.\n\n**Academy Products** \n\nI think that Arsenal can be defended on this because the vast majority of youth academy graduates fail, and that's not just true for foreign talent. Arsenal tend to sign young players at 16 because they show potential even amongst the droves of players within academy, and then develop them until they reach about 22. These signings tend to get ignored until they break into the first team - so it seems like players are never given an opportunity if they slink out and don't make it. So the result is a large pool of youth players, the best of whom may not even be good enough to play for Arsenal - who, let's not forget, are one of the top 10 footballing teams on the planet.\n\nI'd also like to point out that potential is really, really hard to gauge. I remember hearing someone from Arsenal discussing the signing of Luke Freeman on TV, and he basically said that 'Gillingham needed the money, so we took a gamble'. Players at all of the top clubs are released every year because they haven't turned out as good as we hoped, and I don't think that Wenger's record is as bad as it's being made out to be here. \n\nSo basically, it's not that Henri Lansbury, Emannuel-Thomas, Chuks Aneke, Craig Eastmond, Sanchez Watt, Nicky Yennaris, Mark Randall, Luke Freeman, Tom Cruise (seriously), Luke Ayling, Jay Simpson, Justin & Gavin Hoyte, etc ad infinitum are all poorly chosen youth from elsewhere or the academy. They just weren't good enough to make the grade at one of the top 20. \n\n**Player Development** \n\nDepends on the context of 'failure'. Walcott is now in shocking form and definitely not worth the deal he's on, but I'd say that the price we paid for a player who has been instrumental in some of the best moments the club has had (the run to assist Adebayor vs Liverpool as an example) he was perfectly good money. Oxlade is the same, especially as he's only 22, and Chambers is far too early to call. Wilshere is an unfortunate sicknote who is still world-class when fully fit, but lacks the physicality to ever play at that level consistently. And Gibbs has been a rotating left-back for years, managing to play well enough to get capped, and has represented the team in CL semi-finals. \n\nAs for Iwobi, do you really think he'd develop better playing against teams like Rotherham and Doncaster, and training with teams at a similar level, than being rotationally involved at a CL quality club?\n\n**Lack of English Signings**\n\n* Upson - probably overpaid for, but still capped within a year of leaving. You can't say that he was poorly developed if he takes his education elsewhere and kicks on with it, IMO, but he wasn't good enough to make the team. \n* Jeffers - fair enough. Total bollocks.\n* Campbell - huge success.\n* Walcott - regular England international, bought so young that he still counts as a homegrown Arsenal player, at most a fee of \u00a312m. Perhaps not good enough to start at a club that wants to win the BPL, but has shown value in the past and I don't think is an unsuccesful signing.\n* Oxlade - 18 months younger than Wilshere, another good English squad player who regularly represents the international team.\n* Chambers - too early to tell, great first few months but has looked poor since. \n* Welbeck - signed as a squad option rather than an expected and consistent first team starter. Both United and Arsenal fans will tell you that the fee is a reasonable one, I think. Again, an England international.\n\nNot trying to say they're all world-beaters, but apart from a few I think all of the English players we've signed for the first team have at least been pretty decent. As the squad has progressed, they've largely become squad options for better players. \n\nAs for the lack of signings, I think a lot more of that has to do with the teams in control of the English players that Arsenal would've wanted to sign. If you look at the [2006 WC team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#England), there's 4 players in the 23 that don't play for Arsenal, United, Chelsea, Liverpool, or Spurs: Beckham, Downing, Hargreaves, and Owen. Beckham obviously wouldn't have played for another British side, and none of the others would've improved Arsenal. As for the best players - Lampard, Gerrard, Rooney, all the household names - rival clubs would never have sold national talismans to a rival team that went unbeaten two years ago, and were moving into a brand new stadium, for anything less than extortionate cash.\n\nThe same applies to the [EURO 2004 squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2004_squads#England), and the [2010 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#England) - we didn't even qualify for EURO 2008! There are a couple of English players that I'm a bit sad we didn't compete for in retrospect - Baines, Henderson, Cahill all spring to mind - but these players are incredibly highly sought after and have generally moved to another massive British club who would be reluctant to sell to a rival."], [8, "I know Walcott is in bad form right now, but for a 5m player, he has far exceeded expectations. Chamberlain could easily be sold for more than we signed him for, and we have three (2,9) English academy graduates in the first team.\n\nThe only reason this post couldn't be made for literally any other manager in the league, is because they have all only been at their current club for like 31 minutes. \n\nThe so called catch 22 is the worst of the arguments.

He's praised a number of the players, but what he really means is \"he is a very good player [who will go on to have a professional career]\" rather than \"he is a very good player [who will be setting the world on fire for Arsenal next year].\" With youth players you never really know. Alex Iwobi was regarded as a good prospect but not necessarily earmarked for success. Meanwhile you look at Manchester United, Barcelona, they really haven't produced excellent youth players for some time after they each had an outburst of world-class players. (Although United's players have been getting a lot of chances this season.) The other top English clubs also don't have very many academy-developed players. That being said, there has been talk that Arsenal seem to favor the foreign youth players over the English ones. It may well be that they're simply better, most of the time. They can buy foreign youth players from anywhere and are only constrained by price; they can recruit English youth players only locally. Plus, they've developed Ashley Cole and Gibbs isn't a bad player, if he were our starting left back I wouldn't be that annoyed, his development was hampered by injuries and then Monreal has been excellent this season.\n\nOn signing English players: Perhaps he didn't really sign any early in his tenure because he already had good ones. No reason to sign English players purely for the sake of it. \n\nOn development of purchased English players: Now this one I agree quite a bit with. Nasri, Fabregas, RVP all developed under Arsene (of course, so did Bendtner and plenty of other busts). But is the problem that Walcott was never going to be very good - IIRC he was a sprinter and joined the sport pretty late - or that it was a development problem? Oxlade-Chamberlain has mostly been injured, and hot and cold when he wasn't. Chambers just hasn't gotten a look in at all and I wonder if he's good enough (he's still young). Welbeck was probably bought at a fair price and I don't know if he can be expected to progress significantly more given his age - he's essentially a first-teamer. I'm not sure Jenkinson was expected to amount to much, but he's a Premier League quality player and that's a good purchase for 1 million. Ramsey (not English, yes) was very good from a young age, then very injured, then a little up-and-down but clearly has the ability to be in the first team for a long time. But overall, compared to his foreign successes in developing players, there really aren't as many with English players."], [4, "Identifying which u18 or u21 academy players will make the first team is so much more nuanced than you think. Some players push on unexpectedly, like Iwobi, and some players peak early and have relatively quiet careers, like Jay Emmanuel-Thomas.\n\nIt's the same with foreign prospects. When Thomas Eisfeld joined Arsenal, people spoke of him as on the same talent level at Gotze, and he's now playing in the 2.Bundesliga. When Bellerin joined with Jon Toral, Toral was the player people spoke more highly of, yet it's Bellerin who's been one of the best RBs in the PL this season. \n\nAnd it happens across Europe too. Sergi Roberto had made only occasional appearances in Barca's midfield since 2010, but this year he suddenly kicked on and has been excellent both as a CM and RB. Bojan Krkic was the 'next big thing', but faded tremendously. Marco Reus was let go by Dortmund as a youth prospect before flourishing for 'Gladbach.

Then narrow it down to CL level sides and the odds are even smaller. One season of success for others doesn't change that. Look at Andros Townsend, once heralded as the saviour of English football, now left Spurs and residing in the 'where are they now' pile. It's all too easy for these promising talents to drop off. \n\nSorry OP but most of your theories don't hold up to any scrutiny, to the point where arguing against them just seems dumb. Whilst Arsene Wenger may seem to have lost his ability to push a team to the very top, what he has achieved over his time at Arsenal can't dismissed so flippantly. Before Arsene Wenger came to Arsenal you'd find a whole load of nonsense spewed about 'foreign players' and superior English football. Arsene turn that on it's head and changed the culture of the PL for ever. He then followed Spain's lead and tried to change to culture of football in England again. How many PL teams now play a passing game and play the ball out from the back? How many small creative players are now being given a chance in PL teams? These changes are in many ways because of what Arsene has pioneered at Arsenal. \n\nIt could be argued that the short fall is in the English players and the English system. It could well be that Arsenal's failure to bring up fully developed English talent or find more success recently is down to the fact that English players aren't capable of playing the sort of creative football that has ruled elite football for the last half decade. Our National team's performances certainly reflect this. \n\nBut the clickbaity title is beyond me. Listen to any of the great English players that Wenger managed for his first period at the club and all of them regard him with the upmost respect and credit him with improving them as footballers and even changing their lives and extending their careers. But, yeah, \"Never been good for English talent\". He's taken young promising talent and given them a chance at the elite level of football, but that's apparently 'not believing in them'. \n\nThere are disappointments regarding the development of the recent Academy and English players. Wenger definitely has some flaws, a major one being his stubbornness and faith in an ideal. But I think the main difference between Arsenal and Leicester in particular, but also Spurs, is Arsene's belief in the purity of beautiful football and his compete forsaking of the dark side. Especially British football that has traditionally leant a lot on being bigger and tougher, rather than technical. To win you often have to be ruthless and cynical and Wenger just ins't prepared to go there any more. So there is in a way a fundamental gulf between Arsene and a lot of English football."], [2, "Not English but Aaron Ramsey is an identical situation.\nYou've stated chambo and chambers being failures but Ramsey is a success. "], [2, "You did make some decent points, but if you look across Europe, you'll mostly find that the vast majority of youth prospects just don't pan out. Afobe is not the answer to Arsenal's striker problem, and it was clear to Wenger that he would never be,"], [3, "I think the underlying problem is that theres a long list of stigmas that exist in English football. \n\n1. Young English talents with a decent breakthrough always get overrated and overhyped as \"the future of English football\"\n\n2. Breaking through to the senior level and making a name for yourself isn't actually that hard under Wenger. Bellerin was thrown into the mix because Debuchy and Jenkinson were unavailable. Coquelin was thrown into the mix because he had to be recalled early when the whole midfield was out. Gnabry and Jeff and co. were thrown in for similar circumstances. Wilshere, Ox, and Ramsey may be the last three players given a debut out of confidence, but they've regressed ever since. \n\n3. Getting called up to the English team is as simple as playing for a top 4 team, and Arsenal are always top 4. \n\nIf we can blame Wenger for the decline in English football, and there are a few compelling cases to make, one of the big problems is an accumulation of these stigmas. If all it takes to get called up is to be signed to Arsenal, and Wenger is always making an effort to sign the next big player from the England youth level, then it becomes harder and harder to expect much output from the national team. Calum Chambers, at the moment, has a better shot at being called up than Danny Simpson or John Stones. Until this season, Welbeck had a better shot at being called up than Vardy or Kane. Hell, Wilshere hardly ever plays, and he's going to be the first name on the team sheet come next year, rather than someone like Drinkwater or Noble. And then there's Walcott and Ox, who probably have more merit than the other players in the selection pool who generally deliver more on the pitch. \n\nAs long as Wenger's reputation for being a genius sustains, then we'll be stuck with a national team built on his philosophy. And as you can imagine, thats a recipe for disaster. \n\nThankfully though, Reineri, Potchettino, Bilic, and Klopp have stirred the pot, and I'm starting to believe more and more that we're finally going to see more and more players being called up out of confidence "], [2, "Shit, I'd forgotten he was going to be poor just because he values the individual over the English players are just not great players."], [1, "And?

", "id": "d2d3kzc"}], [{"comment": "You're making a few unneeded assumptions, and you've really put the most negative spin on things. There are several points that require addressing:\n\n* First, you're talking about a particularly fallow period of English talent development. What great English talents have any big clubs brought through *in the last 10 years*? Tottenham have Harry Kane and maybe Ryan Mason, Liverpool have Sterling (brought from QPR at 16), Chelsea have Loftus-Cheek at last. In that time, Arsenal have brought through Gibbs, Wilshere, and Iwobi. Not so bad.\n* Secondly, you've made your post without any idea about Arsenal's youth academy or the troubles we've had until now. There was a major lack of investment (curiously coinciding with the boardroom tumult before Kroenke became Majority shareholder in 2011). The period between the youth cup triumph in 2009 (starring Wilshere, Afobe, Ozyakup, and others) and the current crop was particularly dire. For crying out loud, we went 2 years without anyone in charge of youth development before getting Andries Jonkers. Let's call that lot the \"lost generation\". And we underinvested not just in comparison to Chelsea or Man City, but the likes of Spurs, West Ham, Liverpool, and Southampton as well. \n* As to Carl Jenkinson - are you honestly suggesting that championship games are worth as much as playing against Robben and Ribery in the Allianz Arena? \n* As to Kieran Gibbs: he's a solid 6-7/10 player, but Monreal is a 7-8/10 player right now. Form is form, and Monreal has made himself undroppable.  To Gibbs' credit, he's performed *decently* every time he's played, unlike Debuchy for example. But he hasn't been good enough to dislodge Monreal. If he stays for a couple of years (once Monreal slows down, he's 31), he'll likely take the LB spot again.\n* JET: Attitude problems. Everyone has known about his talent, but his attitude was ghastly. Much like Manu Frimpong (at Arsenal from 7 or 8, and who was formidable alongside Wilshere at youth level), his attitude was his undoing. \n* Benik Afobe is one that got away perhaps. But he was allowed to stagnate when the entire youth setup was sinking (relegations, lousy scouting, and so on). Plus, he suffered from a couple of really bad injuries, and lost around 18 months of development because of it.\n* Lansbury: He's a good player, but not nearly good enough for Arsenal, and, as mentioned before, has attitude problems. Even Forest fans will tell you that until recently, Lansbury could be unreliable. \n* To your point about English signings - who should Arsenal have signed? Phil Jones, for 17 million, and compete with Fergie's Man Utd? Sturridge, from Chelsea? Or maybe you mean Adam Lallana, for 25 million, when we already have Cazorla, Wilshere, Rosicky and Ramsey on the books. \n* Continuing with the theme of English signings, you're forgetting Jermain Pennant, who got plenty of chances, and even did ok. Unfortunately, he's a wanker, and it showed with Arsenal and every other team he's played for. Of all of Wenger's English signings, only Upson has any cause for complaint, and even he had to compete with Adams, Bould, and Keown. \n* And as for defenders, please. \"[There] have been plenty of players around the Premier League in last 10 years or so that could have filled the void left by Adams, Keown and Dixon.\" Really. You must not have watched that lot play. There are no English defenders right now fit to lick Tony Adams' boots. The last group who were decent enough were Rio Ferdinand, Terry, Campbell, and poor old Ledley King.\n* Are you honestly saying that Wenger doesn't believe in Theo, Ox, Chambers and Gibbs? Are you nuts? They're given chance after chance (Walcott and Ox in particular) and can never maintain any consistency. Chambers is 21, he'll get his chance. And Gibbs, poor guy, has Monreal ahead of him, who's been our most consistent player this year. \n* \"I'd go as far as saying that Wenger has NEVER been good for English talent.\" Stupid. Stop reading the Telegraph, particularly those wankers Matt Law and Henry Winter.\n* As to the extra reading: The Telegraph has it out for Wenger (right or wrong), and are more clickbaity than ever. The second article is poorly researched rubbish. Of that crop of players, they mention Miquel, Daniel Boateng, Ebecillio and Aneke.  Aneke was a midfielder who had a shot on him, not a striker. Miquel wasn't good enough. Ebecillio... decent but not nearly good enough. Make no mistake, there are \"ones who got away\" from that group. For example, Nordtveit, who captains Norway and starts for Gladbach. Or Ozyakup, who's probably the best player in Turkey this year. \n* As for future youth prospects, we've quite a few right now. Chris Willock should make his league debut next year. Maitland-Niles has already played in the CL. Maybe Akpom can come back into the squad next year also. And Reiss Nelson is the best youth prospect we've had since Wilshere. \n* Also, speaking to the wider issue about youth development, I think you overestimate the importance of the manager. The manager must only make give the final step: a chance in the first team. How many English players have been given a chance over the years (from both within the club and in terms of signings)? Pennant, Cole, Upson, Jeffers, Wilshere, Gibbs, Lansbury, the Hoyte brothers, Jernade Meade, David Bentley, Nico Yennaris, Isaac Hayden, Alex Iwobi, Chuba Akpom... the list goes on and on. If Wenger didn't have trust in English players, why would so many have gotten first team chances? That's ignoring the ludicrous suggestion that Wenger somehow \"doesn't trust\" English players *because they are English*.\n\nLook, I personally think Wenger's time at Arsenal is rightly and sadly coming to a close. There are good reasons why this should be so. However, to criticize him for poor development of English players is stupid. \n\nP.S.

So I'm gonna try and respond in kind.\n\n**Academy Products** \n\nI think that Arsenal can be defended on this because the vast majority of youth academy graduates fail, and that's not just true for foreign talent. Arsenal tend to sign young players at 16 because they show potential even amongst the droves of players within academy, and then develop them until they reach about 22. These signings tend to get ignored until they break into the first team - so it seems like players are never given an opportunity if they slink out and don't make it. So the result is a large pool of youth players, the best of whom may not even be good enough to play for Arsenal - who, let's not forget, are one of the top 10 footballing teams on the planet.\n\nI'd also like to point out that potential is really, really hard to gauge. I remember hearing someone from Arsenal discussing the signing of Luke Freeman on TV, and he basically said that 'Gillingham needed the money, so we took a gamble'. Players at all of the top clubs are released every year because they haven't turned out as good as we hoped, and I don't think that Wenger's record is as bad as it's being made out to be here. \n\nSo basically, it's not that Henri Lansbury, Emannuel-Thomas, Chuks Aneke, Craig Eastmond, Sanchez Watt, Nicky Yennaris, Mark Randall, Luke Freeman, Tom Cruise (seriously), Luke Ayling, Jay Simpson, Justin & Gavin Hoyte, etc ad infinitum are all poorly chosen youth from elsewhere or the academy. They just weren't good enough to make the grade at one of the top 20. \n\n**Player Development** \n\nDepends on the context of 'failure'. Walcott is now in shocking form and definitely not worth the deal he's on, but I'd say that the price we paid for a player who has been instrumental in some of the best moments the club has had (the run to assist Adebayor vs Liverpool as an example) he was perfectly good money. Oxlade is the same, especially as he's only 22, and Chambers is far too early to call. Wilshere is an unfortunate sicknote who is still world-class when fully fit, but lacks the physicality to ever play at that level consistently. And Gibbs has been a rotating left-back for years, managing to play well enough to get capped, and has represented the team in CL semi-finals. \n\nAs for Iwobi, do you really think he'd develop better playing against teams like Rotherham and Doncaster, and training with teams at a similar level, than being rotationally involved at a CL quality club?\n\n**Lack of English Signings**\n\n* Upson - probably overpaid for, but still capped within a year of leaving. You can't say that he was poorly developed if he takes his education elsewhere and kicks on with it, IMO, but he wasn't good enough to make the team. \n* Jeffers - fair enough. Total bollocks.\n* Campbell - huge success.\n* Walcott - regular England international, bought so young that he still counts as a homegrown Arsenal player, at most a fee of \u00a312m. Perhaps not good enough to start at a club that wants to win the BPL, but has shown value in the past and I don't think is an unsuccesful signing.\n* Oxlade - 18 months younger than Wilshere, another good English squad player who regularly represents the international team.\n* Chambers - too early to tell, great first few months but has looked poor since. \n* Welbeck - signed as a squad option rather than an expected and consistent first team starter. Both United and Arsenal fans will tell you that the fee is a reasonable one, I think. Again, an England international.\n\nNot trying to say they're all world-beaters, but apart from a few I think all of the English players we've signed for the first team have at least been pretty decent. As the squad has progressed, they've largely become squad options for better players. \n\nAs for the lack of signings, I think a lot more of that has to do with the teams in control of the English players that Arsenal would've wanted to sign. If you look at the [2006 WC team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#England), there's 4 players in the 23 that don't play for Arsenal, United, Chelsea, Liverpool, or Spurs: Beckham, Downing, Hargreaves, and Owen. Beckham obviously wouldn't have played for another British side, and none of the others would've improved Arsenal. As for the best players - Lampard, Gerrard, Rooney, all the household names - rival clubs would never have sold national talismans to a rival team that went unbeaten two years ago, and were moving into a brand new stadium, for anything less than extortionate cash.\n\nThe same applies to the [EURO 2004 squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2004_squads#England), and the [2010 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#England) - we didn't even qualify for EURO 2008! There are a couple of English players that I'm a bit sad we didn't compete for in retrospect - Baines, Henderson, Cahill all spring to mind - but these players are incredibly highly sought after and have generally moved to another massive British club who would be reluctant to sell to a rival.", "id": "d2d2j18"}], [{"comment": "I know Walcott is in bad form right now, but for a 5m player, he has far exceeded expectations.

Alex Iwobi was regarded as a good prospect but not necessarily earmarked for success. Meanwhile you look at Manchester United, Barcelona, they really haven't produced excellent youth players for some time after they each had an outburst of world-class players. (Although United's players have been getting a lot of chances this season.) The other top English clubs also don't have very many academy-developed players. That being said, there has been talk that Arsenal seem to favor the foreign youth players over the English ones. It may well be that they're simply better, most of the time. They can buy foreign youth players from anywhere and are only constrained by price; they can recruit English youth players only locally. Plus, they've developed Ashley Cole and Gibbs isn't a bad player, if he were our starting left back I wouldn't be that annoyed, his development was hampered by injuries and then Monreal has been excellent this season.\n\nOn signing English players: Perhaps he didn't really sign any early in his tenure because he already had good ones. No reason to sign English players purely for the sake of it. \n\nOn development of purchased English players: Now this one I agree quite a bit with. Nasri, Fabregas, RVP all developed under Arsene (of course, so did Bendtner and plenty of other busts). But is the problem that Walcott was never going to be very good - IIRC he was a sprinter and joined the sport pretty late - or that it was a development problem? Oxlade-Chamberlain has mostly been injured, and hot and cold when he wasn't. Chambers just hasn't gotten a look in at all and I wonder if he's good enough (he's still young). Welbeck was probably bought at a fair price and I don't know if he can be expected to progress significantly more given his age - he's essentially a first-teamer. I'm not sure Jenkinson was expected to amount to much, but he's a Premier League quality player and that's a good purchase for 1 million. Ramsey (not English, yes) was very good from a young age, then very injured, then a little up-and-down but clearly has the ability to be in the first team for a long time.

When Thomas Eisfeld joined Arsenal, people spoke of him as on the same talent level at Gotze, and he's now playing in the 2.Bundesliga. When Bellerin joined with Jon Toral, Toral was the player people spoke more highly of, yet it's Bellerin who's been one of the best RBs in the PL this season. \n\nAnd it happens across Europe too. Sergi Roberto had made only occasional appearances in Barca's midfield since 2010, but this year he suddenly kicked on and has been excellent both as a CM and RB. Bojan Krkic was the 'next big thing', but faded tremendously. Marco Reus was let go by Dortmund as a youth prospect before flourishing for 'Gladbach.

Why invest more resources in a player that has come through the system than one you have already spent the money in bringing over to England?\n\nI don't understand what this has to do with Wenger, post-formation has been a thing in a lot of clubs for a while.

Then narrow it down to CL level sides and the odds are even smaller. One season of success for others doesn't change that. Look at Andros Townsend, once heralded as the saviour of English football, now left Spurs and residing in the 'where are they now' pile. It's all too easy for these promising talents to drop off. \n\nSorry OP but most of your theories don't hold up to any scrutiny, to the point where arguing against them just seems dumb. Whilst Arsene Wenger may seem to have lost his ability to push a team to the very top, what he has achieved over his time at Arsenal can't dismissed so flippantly. Before Arsene Wenger came to Arsenal you'd find a whole load of nonsense spewed about 'foreign players' and superior English football. Arsene turn that on it's head and changed the culture of the PL for ever. He then followed Spain's lead and tried to change to culture of football in England again. How many PL teams now play a passing game and play the ball out from the back? How many small creative players are now being given a chance in PL teams? These changes are in many ways because of what Arsene has pioneered at Arsenal. \n\nIt could be argued that the short fall is in the English players and the English system. It could well be that Arsenal's failure to bring up fully developed English talent or find more success recently is down to the fact that English players aren't capable of playing the sort of creative football that has ruled elite football for the last half decade. Our National team's performances certainly reflect this. \n\nBut the clickbaity title is beyond me. Listen to any of the great English players that Wenger managed for his first period at the club and all of them regard him with the upmost respect and credit him with improving them as footballers and even changing their lives and extending their careers. But, yeah, \"Never been good for English talent\". He's taken young promising talent and given them a chance at the elite level of football, but that's apparently 'not believing in them'. \n\nThere are disappointments regarding the development of the recent Academy and English players. Wenger definitely has some flaws, a major one being his stubbornness and faith in an ideal. But I think the main difference between Arsenal and Leicester in particular, but also Spurs, is Arsene's belief in the purity of beautiful football and his compete forsaking of the dark side. Especially British football that has traditionally leant a lot on being bigger and tougher, rather than technical. To win you often have to be ruthless and cynical and Wenger just ins't prepared to go there any more.

Young English talents with a decent breakthrough always get overrated and overhyped as \"the future of English football\"\n\n2. Breaking through to the senior level and making a name for yourself isn't actually that hard under Wenger. Bellerin was thrown into the mix because Debuchy and Jenkinson were unavailable. Coquelin was thrown into the mix because he had to be recalled early when the whole midfield was out. Gnabry and Jeff and co. were thrown in for similar circumstances. Wilshere, Ox, and Ramsey may be the last three players given a debut out of confidence, but they've regressed ever since. \n\n3. Getting called up to the English team is as simple as playing for a top 4 team, and Arsenal are always top 4. \n\nIf we can blame Wenger for the decline in English football, and there are a few compelling cases to make, one of the big problems is an accumulation of these stigmas. If all it takes to get called up is to be signed to Arsenal, and Wenger is always making an effort to sign the next big player from the England youth level, then it becomes harder and harder to expect much output from the national team. Calum Chambers, at the moment, has a better shot at being called up than Danny Simpson or John Stones. Until this season, Welbeck had a better shot at being called up than Vardy or Kane. Hell, Wilshere hardly ever plays, and he's going to be the first name on the team sheet come next year, rather than someone like Drinkwater or Noble. And then there's Walcott and Ox, who probably have more merit than the other players in the selection pool who generally deliver more on the pitch. \n\nAs long as Wenger's reputation for being a genius sustains, then we'll be stuck with a national team built on his philosophy. And as you can imagine, thats a recipe for disaster. \n\nThankfully though, Reineri, Potchettino, Bilic, and Klopp have stirred the pot, and I'm starting to believe more and more that we're finally going to see more and more players being called up out of confidence ", "id": "d2daeme"}, {"comment": "TLDR:\n\n* England managers simply call up English players who are on top 4 clubs (and Liverpool, I would add).\n\n* Wenger is at fault because his club finishes in the top 4.\n\n* Wilshere should not have been called up at all last year, as he is overrated.\n\n* Thankfully now, all this will change and players form non-top 4 + Liverpool (managed by Reineri, Potchettino and Klopp) will get a chance.\n", "id": "d2dfyct"}], [{"comment": "Shit, I'd forgotten he was going to be poor just because he values the individual over the English players are just not great players.", "id": "d2dbzul"}], [{"comment": "And?

Also in charge of merchandise and branding. \n\n**Operations** I work in this department.  Work within the team to essentially make all team and coach activities as easy as possible. This includes coordinating schedules, travel, lodging and hosting, etc. This also includes working with our league and organizers to make sure we stay on top of league rules. This is pretty easy at our level (4th tier of US Soccer in the NPSL), but at MLS/EPL levels, this includes following sponsorship rules (i.e., if the EPL has a drink sponsor of Coca-Cola, no Pepsi products can be seen in ANYONES hands at official events). \n\nThese guys also work gamedays. This includes setup, teardown, and getting people in and out. A lot of what we do is preparing for the rush of people 20 minutes before kickoff until -20 after kick, and the 20 minutes after full time. Its imperative we get people a positive experience, while also building branding. We are the people running around with radios. \n\nWithin this department we also have finances and accounting, taking the money from each game and merchandise sales, and pay everyone. Usually goes rent/expendables, team/coaches, backroom staff (like the actual employees), and the rest goes into an account to either fund future endeavors (like player transfers or upgrades). Anything left after a season usually goes to players or end-of-season bonuses. This is rare though.\n\n**Team Operations** is essentially the players, coaches, physios, trainers, etc. These guys single job is to win. Everyone else besides these guys are to get as many people into the club and spending money ***regardless of winning or losing***. At our level, some of our players are full time players (Dario Suarez was our best player this year, and is a full time international from Cuba) to collegiate athletes who make no money. \n\nHopefully this answers your question.

He had two full seconds on the ball when the window to make that pass was open (and it didn't even get smaller before he did play it).

The timing was obvious, the pressure was nonexistent, and the space into which the ball was played was enormous.  It literally does not get easier than that for players of Busquets' and Messi's calibers.\n\nWhat's so intricate here?  What decision-making makes this impressive?  I just don't see anything at all that even a youth player would be incapable of seeing or doing.\n\nAnd just for the record, if you're constantly being annoyed by \"arrogance and ignorance\" around here... well, if it always smells like shit it might be you.", "id": "cyn01hs"}, {"comment": "Do you actually see that Busquets first pretended to play a pass to Rakitic and all the opposition players expected this pass, only for then to play the pass to Messi instead, easily taking out 2 players in the process.", "id": "cyn0jwm"}, {"comment": "No, actually, I don't see that.  I see Busquets receive the ball in space, evaluate his options (Rakitic and Messi), see Messi in acres of space and completely unmarked, and play the ball to him.\n\nNow, the two defenders.  The guy closest to Busquets is actually trying to cut off the ball to Messi-- he doesn't lunge to try and close off the angle to Rakitic at all.  However, because he is for some reason marking Messi and also responsible for closing down Busquets (the clip I'd like to see is the one that shows how Barca broke down Espanyol's formation well enough that they had one player covering so much space and Messi at the same time), he can't cut off the angle in time, which left Busquets a sizeable gap through which to play the ball.\n\nThe second defender is just flat out lazy.  I will give you that he stops when Busquets hits a pass as if he expects the ball to go to Rakitic, but he was already dead in the water at that point.  His job was to pick up Messi when his teammate stepped to Busquets, and he didn't do it.  The play was wide open as soon as he failed to rotate.  So sure, if you think catching a defender out after he had already failed to track his man is worthy of high praise, then sure, this is magical.  For my money, though, the high-level play culminated in the pass to Busquets and allowed him to play such a simple pass into open space for a player who should never go unmarked, especially in the middle of the field.\n\nThere you go.  That's my take on the play.  Well-executed, yes, but really simple.  I would expect an eleven year old to be able to turn into space, get his head up, and hit an attacker running into space in the middle.

At the start of the clip the holding mid (?) is close to Messi, but as soon as the ball is played to Busquets he has to step to the ball.  That should mean that the winger drops deeper and narrower, hopefully preventing Messi from receiving the ball.  Call it whatever you want-- whether it's a lack of compactness or a failure to mark Messi, the fact is that the winger did not drop to cover the space that his teammate vacated, which left tons of space for a pass to Messi.\n\n> Now both Espanyol players expect the ball to be played either between them to Messi or to Rakitic, but the ball to Rakitic poses no immediate danger so there is no real effort to prevent it.\n\nIt doesn't, and that's not especially important.  The players should be moving to close down the space in the middle even if that means leaving Rakitic open.  This is where it seems to me that Busquets'  playis being overestimated-- he positioned his body to enable himself to play a pass to either Rakitic or Messi, but the defenders should have been allowing a pass to Rakitic in order to close down Messi regardless of his actions.  If he \"faked\" anybody out, it was after they had already made their big mistake.\n\n> A lot of players would not have the awareness to correctly identify the space and adjust accordingly.\n\nI really don't think that's true.  There's so much space and so much time on the ball for Busquets that it wasn't especially challenging for him to play the ball there.  Right from the start he can see Messi and see the space in behind Espanyol's midfielder (look at the glance up he takes when he first gets the ball and turns), and because he's under nearly zero pressure he has an easy time picking out a pass.  Again, I would expect an academy player to be able to pick out that pass from a young age, especially if afforded that much time.  The play from the point shown in the clip is as much or more about the way Espanyol's midfield fails to keep its shape, close down Busquets, and mark Messi as it is about any piece of vision or skill from Busquets.\n\nI'd also like to reiterate that both Busquets and Barca are capable of breathtaking skill and vision, this just isn't a good example of anything like that.", "id": "cyn7m4g"}], [{"comment": "I respect Busquets as much as the next man, but come the fuck on.

Im rather arguing as to why I believe you can't discredit his ability as a player because he is playing in the MLS.**\n\nIn my opinion this is a very bad post. I have watched almost every game Gio played for Juve, where he was by no means a bad player, and a lot of games he played for Parma where he was tremendous. Even though he isn't challenged at MLS the same way he would be in Italy does not mean he is a bad player. The reason he went to MLS was above all his salary of about 7 million $ which is a lot larger than any salary he would be given in Serie A. My point being that he did not leave because of lack of quality but rather as an opportunity to try a new league and get paid well.\n\nThe reason he did not succed at Juve are many. First of all Contes philosophy for attackers was at his tenure at Juve detrimental to creative players that need to roam free. For example Tevez was a lot more impactful for us under Allegri simply because he was free to roam around. \n\nAnd he definetly is on the same level or just a level below a lot of other players that are being called up for italy as attackers.

First off how many of those 23 appearances are starts, how many were subbed on? And just putting goal stats is telling only part of the story. During his last game for Italy which was against Norway. He came off the bench to help in both goals so Italy could win the match 2-1 making sure italy would top their qualification group. He then came back the next day to play for TFC and help seal their first playoff birth in franchise history.  \n\nSecondly bringing in Fifa game stats no matter the reason is a joke, I mean Rooney is an 84 and he is doing shit more often than not now a days. Those stats are ridiculously, many players are under or over rated with them for a host of reasons: hype, length of playing career, Cult status, etc. Giovinco is not the only one to be affect by this for better or worse, and to single him out is being disingenuous at best.\n\nI would agree the defenses are terrible in the MLS, but worst than the top \"10-15\" leagues in the world? really? Do you have any idea how quickly the quality falls off? I mean League 1 is 4th in Europe and r/soccer makes fun of the quality of defense there. Let's not even look at how shoddy defense is in the Eredivisie or leagues of that size can be. Even Gerrard said he was pleasantly surprised how good the league is from what he was told it would be. And he isn't alone, Thierry Henry, Kanne, Beckham, have all said that the MLS is not the cake walk that Europe tries to make of it.That said I would not expect an MLS team to finish anywhere near the top half of the Premier league. But they could do well in other leagues, like the Eredivisie.\n\nAnd so what about the transfer fees? transfer fees do not always show how good a player is. And because of the salary cap in the MLS, you aren't going for the best player money can get you, but the best bang for your buck. this does mean the quality isn't there, but worse than the top 10-15 leagues in the world? no. \nAnd you are ignoring how much confidence can translate from club to international, for example, Altidore has been doing much better for the US team since his numbers picked up with TFC. And I'm sure the same could be the case with Giovinco.\n\nNow just look at how he plays, just like yesterday, how he scored the first goal against NYCFC. he was able to flick the ball around his back between him and the defender and turn for a shot. This isn't a one time thing he does for the team, but that happens on an almost near weekly bases.\nSo in the end, should we take in consideration in what league he plays in when calling him up? Yes. But I think he warrants a look at the bare minimum. I don't think he deserves a starting position, but as on the bench or to fill in for an injured player, absolutely. \n"], [2, "I dont want to break Muricans heart but your league is a shithole.

I have watched almost every game Gio played for Juve, where he was by no means a bad player, and a lot of games he played for Parma where he was tremendous. Even though he isn't challenged at MLS the same way he would be in Italy does not mean he is a bad player. The reason he went to MLS was above all his salary of about 7 million $ which is a lot larger than any salary he would be given in Serie A. My point being that he did not leave because of lack of quality but rather as an opportunity to try a new league and get paid well.\n\nThe reason he did not succed at Juve are many. First of all Contes philosophy for attackers was at his tenure at Juve detrimental to creative players that need to roam free. For example Tevez was a lot more impactful for us under Allegri simply because he was free to roam around. \n\nAnd he definetly is on the same level or just a level below a lot of other players that are being called up for italy as attackers.

First off how many of those 23 appearances are starts, how many were subbed on? And just putting goal stats is telling only part of the story. During his last game for Italy which was against Norway. He came off the bench to help in both goals so Italy could win the match 2-1 making sure italy would top their qualification group. He then came back the next day to play for TFC and help seal their first playoff birth in franchise history.  \n\nSecondly bringing in Fifa game stats no matter the reason is a joke, I mean Rooney is an 84 and he is doing shit more often than not now a days. Those stats are ridiculously, many players are under or over rated with them for a host of reasons: hype, length of playing career, Cult status, etc. Giovinco is not the only one to be affect by this for better or worse, and to single him out is being disingenuous at best.\n\nI would agree the defenses are terrible in the MLS, but worst than the top \"10-15\" leagues in the world? really? Do you have any idea how quickly the quality falls off? I mean League 1 is 4th in Europe and r/soccer makes fun of the quality of defense there. Let's not even look at how shoddy defense is in the Eredivisie or leagues of that size can be. Even Gerrard said he was pleasantly surprised how good the league is from what he was told it would be. And he isn't alone, Thierry Henry, Kanne, Beckham, have all said that the MLS is not the cake walk that Europe tries to make of it.That said I would not expect an MLS team to finish anywhere near the top half of the Premier league. But they could do well in other leagues, like the Eredivisie.\n\nAnd so what about the transfer fees? transfer fees do not always show how good a player is. And because of the salary cap in the MLS, you aren't going for the best player money can get you, but the best bang for your buck. this does mean the quality isn't there, but worse than the top 10-15 leagues in the world? no. \nAnd you are ignoring how much confidence can translate from club to international, for example, Altidore has been doing much better for the US team since his numbers picked up with TFC. And I'm sure the same could be the case with Giovinco.\n\nNow just look at how he plays, just like yesterday, how he scored the first goal against NYCFC. he was able to flick the ball around his back between him and the defender and turn for a shot. This isn't a one time thing he does for the team, but that happens on an almost near weekly bases.\nSo in the end, should we take in consideration in what league he plays in when calling him up? Yes.

There are more to transfers than what some fans like to imagine (I'd speculate it's the mentality Football Manager gives you).\n\nSome of the factors that were involved in the El Shaarawy saga: \n\n* 2 years of fairly poor performances and a ton of injuries at Milan.\n\n* Rumors of Milan not being happy with his behavior off the pitch, said to enjoy partying (some smaller talk about drug use, but that rumor seems a bit too untrustworthy to put any faith in right now).\n\n* Milan was expected to play 4-3-1-2 last summer and while the coach publicly said he could be adapted to a midfielder that didn't seem to be something the player was interested in. This lead to the loan to Monaco with forced buyout clause after 25(?) matches. Monaco made it clear with 1 match to go that they would not let him play any more to avoid triggering the clause.\n\n* With El Shaarawy coming back and Milan having changed to playing with wingers (and had a severe lack in wingers in the squad) it seemed like a good situation for him to stay at the club. This didn't seem like the player wanted, and while there were rumored of a few more clubs interested in him it seems very likely the player himself really pushed for Roma, and Milan decided to not force him into sitting on the Milan bench (which seemed likely at that time) or be sent a place he didn't want to go.\n\n* The buyout clause + the loan price for Roma equaled about the same amount that Monaco had as buyout clause. That was after half a season of failure in a league that frankly is significantly easier for an attacking player than Serie A. At the time it's not unreasonable to say that the deal was a fair one, not a handout.\n\nYes, I did make some assumptions in these points that may or may not be true, but they are all plausible with the information that came out in the media through the season.

Brazil: Bias aside, I give them 1st because their peak periods are absolutely ridiculous and demolish other team's peak periods. The 1958-1970 period is the most dominant stretch of international play in WC history and featured a duo that never lost when they played together. They have the consensus GOAT player as of today, and in terms of a top 100, they probably would have the most members represented. Brazil is not as consistent as you'd like for the #1 country but they have the best peak out of any of them, and the most WC titles. They're ahead, for now.\n\n2. Germany: Very close 2nd. They're the most consistent country in the world, producing great teams almost every cycle. Even during their supposedly dark years post 1990, they still managed to get to a final in 2002 and a semis in 2006. They're ridiculously consistent, and have enough titles to contend for #1. Also, as a nice little bonus, they trolled the current #1 for their biggest defeat in history in their own house.\n\n3. Italy: Giving them 3rd is pretty straight foward since they have 4 WC titles and no one else is really close after the top 2. They've had great ups and some bad lows in terms of performance but all in all, still the clear #3 country ever. They have the best defense of all-time as well.\n\n4. Argentina: I'm giving them #4 as they've had several top 2 finishes in the WC and only lag behind Uruguay by a bit in Copa. They also are more consistent than Uruguay in terms of generational talent and overall performance in important competitions. They also have 2 players that can contend for the GOAT title.\n\n5. Uruguay: They've fallen hard since their early years of dominance, but 2 WC titles are 2 WC titles. They're also the best team in Copa historically. Their overall talent produced isn't as consistent as some of the other teams but they make it count when it matters. Managed to have the biggest upset in history with the Maracanazo in 1950, counts for a lot. They're very close to losing their #5 spot to some of the countries below though.\n\n6. Spain: I'd give them the #5 spot but 2 WC titles are hard to overlook. They've produced more talent overall, and have been the greatest country since the turn of the century. 1 more cycle at the top and they take #5, and with 1 more WC title they can contend for #4.\n\n7. France: Since the 80s, one of the best countries in the world. Produced great talent before that, and all-time talent since then. I think they're right behind Spain, they're very close because France does better in WC and Spain does better in Euros. Overall though, Spain has one more Euro title so they're ahead for now.\n\n8. Netherlands: This is the only time I've overlooked titles won over performance. Netherlands is one of the greatest countries in terms of talent produced, but they've yet to fulfill their destiny in terms of actually winning titles. Historically, they've had much better runs than England but never actually won anything in the WC. However, they do have one Euros, which is not the same as the WC, but they've been consistently superior and finished in the top 4 way more times than England in the latter. They also have a GOAT contender.\n\n9. England: It was tough leaving them behind Netherlands but I think it's the right choice. The WC title is their one claim to the #8 spot but aside from that, they lag behind the other countries at the top. They produced some great talent in the 60s and some nice talent since then, but their consistency in the WC is not comparable to the other teams. They only had 2 top 4 finishes in the WC, the least of all the WC winners, 3 less than the Netherlands. No Euro title either.\n\n10. Czechoslovakia: This was tough, Portugal, Sweden, and even Hungary have good claims here and are probably the next best, but the former Czechoslovakia have placed better both in the WC and Euros (Sweden has more top 4 finishes but Czechoslovakia has more top 2 finishes which is slightly better in my book).

I think for some reason.\n\nWith those two aging, there'll soon be a new platform of players so to speak dominating the football scene.\n\nGriezmann is really versatile and has every top attribute to be the best player in the world. No.1 might be a bit of a stretch, but he's one of the best players already, who knows? Look how young the lad still is and how he performed during the last Euros and in the Champions League last season for Atl\u00e9tico. Basically scoring most of their vital goals which took them to the final, that applies to France as well actually.\n\nLooking at other players who could be in contention for Ballon d'Or at some stage along with Griezmann hmmm, off the top of my head and logically thinking, in no specific order - De Bruyne, Dybala, Pogba, Neymar, Bale, Hazard, Verratti, Coutinho, Carrasco (a bit of a stretch?), James (once he finds a new club and starts playing the way he used to). IMO.\n\nDamn I only thought of attacking players, and didn't even think about defenders or goalkeepers. Well when it comes to GK-s - Neuer, De Gea, Oblak, Donnarumma (in the far future).\n", "id": "dafrypn"}, {"comment": "No its not likely.Not with Bale and Neymar around and not with the way Atletico play", "id": "dafsrvy"}, {"comment": "Good point about Bale and Neymar. But it has nothing to do with the way Atl\u00e9tico play. He has been scoring 20+ goals for them during the past two seasons in the league. Was instrumental to their Champions League campaign as I said scoring most of the all important goals. And for the record Atleti have been playing a bit more offensive football this season, scoring way more goals than they used to, while still being very solid defensively. \n\nI'm not really big into \"what-ifs\" and \"what could have been-s\", but had Atleti won the CL and France the Euros, Griezmann would probably be the top contender for Ballon d'Or this year.

Corrupt FIFA.\n\nAnyway as long as Cristiano and Messi are around, it's very difficult for any other player to win the award, although lately they are becoming closer. \n\nWho cares about the Ballon d'Or anyway? Everybody knows that Messi is the best player in the world and in the end all that matters is how you feel, not how they hand out Ballon d'Or awards.

Had it gone the way I said earlier, he'd be the top contender for the Ballon d'Or this year. \n\nCristiano will win it anyway thanks to Real Madrid winning the CL and him captaining Portugal to the Euros victory. \n\nToo bad players like Vidal (who's not even in the running for Ballon d'Or this year) or Alexis don't get that much recognition, considering what they've achieved with Chile (two Copa Am\u00e9ricas in a row) both summers running,.", "id": "daftm9y"}, {"comment": "The last 3 winners were all over 27, so I don't see your point and don't have an issue not being at your \"depth\".

Then, quite possibly the best individual performance of all-time spurred Tottenham to three unanswered goals: Bale, starting at left-back, raced forward in the first quarter of an hour of the second half and hit a cross-goal shot into the bottom corner of Julio Cesar's net. Then, nearing injury time, the Welshman scored an almost identical strike, and just a couple of minutes later, netted his third from the edge of the area. A game that could have been one to forget for Spurs fans, saw the underdogs almost pull off the greatest of comebacks via the goals of a left-back.\n\nThe return group fixture saw Spurs maintain much cooler heads right throughout the squad, and the game was well and truly taken to Inter. Bale didn't manage to score in this game, but he *did* get the best of the best right-sided full-back in the world at the time, which was the birth of the phrase \"Taxi for Maicon!\". Constantly beating the Brazilian for pace and overall desire, putting in teasing cross after teasing cross, and really establishing himself as a top player. 3-1 was the final score, and the treble winning side of the previous season were rightfully beaten.\n\nNow, which one of those would I call the best game of all-time?

Then, quite possibly the best individual performance of all-time spurred Tottenham to three unanswered goals: Bale, starting at left-back, raced forward in the first quarter of an hour of the second half and hit a cross-goal shot into the bottom corner of Julio Cesar's net. Then, nearing injury time, the Welshman scored an almost identical strike, and just a couple of minutes later, netted his third from the edge of the area. A game that could have been one to forget for Spurs fans, saw the underdogs almost pull off the greatest of comebacks via the goals of a left-back.\n\nThe return group fixture saw Spurs maintain much cooler heads right throughout the squad, and the game was well and truly taken to Inter. Bale didn't manage to score in this game, but he *did* get the best of the best right-sided full-back in the world at the time, which was the birth of the phrase \"Taxi for Maicon!\". Constantly beating the Brazilian for pace and overall desire, putting in teasing cross after teasing cross, and really establishing himself as a top player. 3-1 was the final score, and the treble winning side of the previous season were rightfully beaten.\n\nNow, which one of those would I call the best game of all-time? Probably the latter. I've never been so proud of an English club against a foreign side.

You can read up on some books and articles in order to learn the weaknesses and strengths of different formations as well as the different ways to play each formation. \n\nFor example, 4-5-1 and 4-2-3-1 are essentially the same formation with 4 defenders, 5 midfielders, and a striker. The difference between them comes from the managers style. A manager that prefers to play 4-5-1 (Di Biasi with Albania and Montella so far for Milan) will tend to be more defensive and organized. They will emphasize aligning the midfield, minimizing holes on the pitch, and exploiting the flanks. A manager that prefers a 4-2-3-1 (Pellegrini last season with Man City) will put an emphasis on the attack, because those 3 midfielders are essentially attacking midfielders. This kind of managerial style revolves around fast paced movement, short and safe passing, as well as patient build up. \n\nBasically, there are not that many different formations to choose from. The most common ones are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 4-5-1, and 3-5-2. The tactics and manager styles are what give each formation a unique twist. \n\n4-4-2 is a great defensive formation but some managers teach it in a way that it becomes 2-4-4 in attack with the wingers and defenders pushing forward. \n\n4-3-3 is a great attacking formation. Some managers instruct their full backs to push forward and their one center midfielder to drop back making it a 3-4-3 in the attack. If the wingers drop back on defense, it can be a 4-5-1. \n\n4-5-1 as I explained earlier is a decent option, because it can quickly change into a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 depending on what the manager likes and who he plays. \n\n3-5-2 is an excellent formation to show the difference in play styles. It can become a 5-3-2 if the wide players are defensive minded. Juventus like to play this formation. When they play Sandro and Cuadrado on the wings, it shows that Allegri has the intention to push forward and keep a 3-5-2. VONTE also played this with Italy, however he used De Sciglio and Florenzi on the wings because his style is way more defensive. \n\nBy watching games and paying close attention, you begin to notice the line up and starting formation as well as how the formation changes from attack to defense. This is what makes each managers style unique. \n", "id": "d667ypn"}, {"comment": "So helpful, thanks.", "id": "d67yssy"}], [{"comment": "Does anyone else feel as though it's becoming more acceptable for outfield players to perform at the top level well into their thirties?
