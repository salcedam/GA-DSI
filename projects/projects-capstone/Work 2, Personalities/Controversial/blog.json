(Permit me a slight delay, I require a moment to alter the positioning of an eating utensil.) The calling most commonly associated with my physical form is Katy, but you have my permission to refer to me as The Penguin of Doom. (The absurdity of this situation has bolstered my tendency towards jocularity and has resulted in an enthusiastic guffaw.) As should no doubt be evident, my behavior is not governed by any discernible influences or routines.\n\nSuch irregularity is the primary basis for my motivation towards joining your numbers. It is my wish to associate myself with entities who possess no predictability in their actions.\n\nIt has been approximately five thousand days since my birth, and although such a small measure of time is typically associated with naivety or an insufferable nature, most would agree that my decorum mirrors that of one much older than myself. My favorite pastimes include the viewing of a television show known by the title of \"Invader Zim,\" the content of which I peruse with my girlfriend. (My sexual preferences have been defined via a combination of forces external to myself, and as such, I would appreciate a balanced and appropriate response to the topic.) We delight in media which, in its execution, bears a resemblance to the internal processes which obscure anything but a truly mercurial existence.\n\nIncidentally, the individual to whom I previously referred exhibits similar behavior traits to myself. However, it is my desire to surround myself with an increasing number of like-minded persons. My belief is that an expansive social circle will promote positive emotions.\n\nThese are the motivating forces behind my aforementioned desires. It is my hope that you will feel similarly inclined towards platonic connections.\n\nCATASTROPHE!\n\nFear not, such outbursts are merely my way of solidifying external viewers' impression of my unsystematic conduct. I offer my felicitations, as well as a conceptualized suggestion pertinent to the imagery of a traditional breakfast meal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Penguin of Doom", "id": "d38hjyb"}, {"comment": "I'm right there with you, pal.

But let's take the infamous picsOfDeadkids example. The actual content of that subreddit is mostly autopsy photos. Obviously it's a troll subreddit and created to get a reaction, and I'd guess 98% of redditors think it's gross/offensive etc. But what if the name of the subreddit was /r/autopsyphotos or /r/doyoureallywanttogointocriminalforensics and they were sincere in their discussion of these images? Would some of that 98% now be ok with it? I would bet at least some would. What if it wasn't kids but adults? Or historical autopsy photos only? The point is I don't want to be the one making those decisions for anyone but myself, and it's not the business reddit is in. **We're a free speech site with very few exceptions (mostly personal info) and having to stomach occasional troll reddit like picsofdeadkids or morally quesitonable reddits like jailbait are part of the price of free speech on a site like this.**\n\n[Reddit General Manger](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/iuz8a/iama_reddit_general_manager_ama/c26uuxb?context=3), /u/hueypriest.\n\n*emphasis mine*\n\n------------------------\n\n>Delivering a speech in Amsterdam last month, Ohanian voiced his opposition to CISPA without addressing Facebook\u2019s support. \u201cWe value privacy and a right to free speech in the real world, this is fundamental to our democracy. For some reason the rules change online, when it\u2019s digital, but free speech and privacy should be respected online as well,\u201d he said.\n\n>Speaking to Venture Beat earlier this month, Reddit General Manager Erik Martin added that although his company usually avoids taking political sides, the realities of what could happen if CISPA passes is something that could shape the future of not just Reddit, but how the Internet operates entirely.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in activism, but there are times when we can help make sure the community\u2019s voice is heard. And Reddit is built upon having a free and open internet \u2026 we\u2019re open source, don\u2019t require user info, user curated etc. So, anything that might threaten a free and open internet impacts both the community and the company,\u201d said Martin.\n\n[RT](https://www.rt.com/usa/reddit-facebook-cispa-support-795/)\n\n--------------\n\n>\u201cWe uphold the ideal of free speech on Reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to,\u201d said Yishan Wong, Reddit\u2019s chief executive, but because the company believes that the user \u201chas the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil,\u201d and that it is the user\u2019s responsibility to do so. His company blog post was titled \u201cEvery Man Is Responsible for His Own Soul.\u201d \n\n[New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/reddit-and-4chan-begin-to-button-up/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0)\n\n-----------\n\nFuck you new admins.", "id": "cyhsr2a"}, {"comment": "Thread is locked", "id": "cyhgk37"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cyhf7kd"}, {"comment": "Please see our sidebar to review some of our totalitarian rules.

Our obsession with proving we're our own after being called crows is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with crows/robins and redditors laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.\n\nJackdaws are competative, hard core, by nature.

Will you help support classrooms for thousands of students and teachers this year?", "2016-08-01 23:10:29", 2636, "https://www.redditgifts.com/teachers/", [[1, "Hey all. BluePinkBlack here, and as you know, I run the Reddit Gifts program here.  It\u2019s one of the great joys of my life, to be honest, because of the incredible positive energy that comes from it.  \n\n\nAs you can see, today we announced some changes to \u2018Reddit Gifts for the Teachers\u2019, and I think we could have better explained why we made these changes.  I\u2019m sorry that we didn\u2019t explain it well up front.   The teacher\u2019s exchange was a very well regarded program, but the honest truth is our volunteer mods, staff, and users across the board were having to devote far more time to this program than was usual for our other programs.  It was clear to the Reddit Gifts team that in its previous state, Reddit Gifts for the Teachers was simply not a feasible program to continue pursuing - so much that we debated discontinuing it entirely.\n\n\nHowever, when it became clear that we could get the best of both worlds - continue to make life easier for talented educators, upholdthe spirit of this program, and to reduce our overhead cost by partnering with DonorsChoose.org, we did not hesitate to jump at the chance! Reddit and DonorsChoose.org have a long, long history of doing good together: there\u2019s [Colbert](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ddc0w/update_in_less_than_eight_hours_the_colbertrally/), [Ohanian](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nfx00/iama_cofounder_of_reddit_alexis_ohanian_amaath/), and heck, even [Reddit Gifts](https://www.donorschoose.org/redditgifts) who have all worked with this organization in the past. [Charity Navigator rates them](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=9284) an 96.66 out of 100. This makes them one of the most highly regarded charities in America.\n\n\nWe knew that there might be strong reaction to this decision, but I\u2019m saddened that we may have made it worse by failing to anticipate the depths of that emotion., I mentioned this in a previous post, and I\u2019ll say it again\u2014my sincerity may not read through in text, but we\u2019ve done what we felt was best for the longevity of giving to those who need it most. Yes, change is hard, especially when it means we\u2019re missing out on giving to international classrooms, but when we looked at the financial sustainability of RedditGifts as a whole, this compromise was far preferable to eliminating the giving program entirely. In hindsight, bringing this change to the community beforehand probably would have been a better option.  We didn\u2019t, because traditionally Reddit Gifts has had a rule that we don\u2019t disclose what we have planned for upcoming batches.  We should have diverged from that rule here.\n\n\nI\u2019m very sorry that so many people were disappointed with this decision - but there is still good to be had, I\u2019m sure of it. Already today, Redditors have helped completely fund multiple projects, and received thank you notes from those teachers. You can check just a few of those out [here](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/a-tree-grows-in-the-bronx/1979926/?challengeid=20797311), [here](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/supplies-for-successful-students/2059719/?challengeid=20797311), [here](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/cpr-rrr-you-going-to-help-us-save-lives/1977554/?challengeid=20797311), [here](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/wobble-chairs-for-busy-learners/2076866/?challengeid=20797327), and [here](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/a-classroom-for-all-students/2067131/?challengeid=20797326). "], [598, "**EDIT #2: Please visit [my boycott thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/) over at /r/teachers if you want to see teachers themselves expressing disapproval of this year's event.**\n\n**EDIT: Redditors, please read the comments to this post. I've decided on the opinion that this event should be boycotted because it misleads people who would donate.**\n\nAs a teacher in America who could benefit from this, I'm disappointed in the decision to team up with DonorsChoose. This is supposed to be a reddit event, but it seems like total control has been given to DonorsChoose, and reddit is simply being used to link to DC and advertise their website.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there is no connection to reddit beyond attaching its name to DonorsChoose for one month and *maybe* tracking how much money redditors donate.\n\nBut is the money going to other redditors? Today is the first day of this program, so let's take a look at who is asking for what...\n\nLanguage & Literacy: 300 requests\n\nMath & Science: 289 requests\n\nMusic & the Arts: 302 requests\n\nApplied Learning: 296 requests\n\nHealth & Sports: 307 requests\n\nHistory & Civics: 308 requests\n\nSpecial Needs: 299 requests\n\nI think it's very unlikely that 2,101 redditors signed up in the past hour, considering that's 12% of all teachers who received gifts last year, and this isn't taking into account that this year is US-only.\n\nLooking a bit closer, I notice that the teachers who are listed on the RedditGifts+DonorsChoose alliance have [projects that began before RedditGifts for Teachers 2016 began](http://i.imgur.com/ki45p7d.png).\n\nThis isn't a reddit event. It's DonorsChoose using reddit to accomplish *their* mission.\n\nIf reddit admins can't fulfill their ambitions, they should just not do the project. I think this is deceptive to reddit donors. The way this is presented makes it seem like redditors are helping redditors.\n\nCharity is great, but there's always at least a little bit of self-interest when donating to charity. In the case of Reddit Gifts for Teachers, that self-interest comes in the form of redditors wanting to help other redditors. We're a community, and we want to feel like we're giving back to our own community. Sure, there are likely many redditors who don't care to make this distinction, but they can go to DonorsChoose themselves and donate; they don't need Reddit to advertise for them to do this.\n\nI think my point is driven home when we consider the issues people have had in previous years. Many people complained that Reddit Gifts for Teachers was unsustainable because non-redditors would sign up in August just to receive gifts, but never contribute to reddit the community. I saw a lot of people suggesting ideas like limiting sign-ups to redditors with accounts at least x days/months/years old or with y amount of comments/karma to ensure that redditors are actually helping members of their own community.\n\nInstead of going with those suggestions, it seems RedditGifts admins went the opposite direction and decided that there is no longer a need to feign membership at reddit at all to receive gifts. All a teacher needs is a DonorsChoose project to receive charity from redditors.\n\nPerhaps the project should be marketed as *DonorsChoose: Funded by Reddit*, but that honesty wouldn't attract charitable redditors who care about the distinction being glossed over.\n\nI appreciate all the work Reddit Gifts admins have done in the past, I recognize their passion to help teachers, and I understand the difficulties that come with this mission...but I do not agree with the direction they decided to take. It seems disingenuous in nature and disrespectful to the generous redditors who have invested in this project in the past.\n\nAm I wrong in my assessment in this? I'd love for Reddit Gifts admins to weigh in and comment. I might be incorrect on a lot of this, and I hope I am. But it seems misleading."], [433, "I don't like this.  DonorsChoose is a fine organization, but it removes the personal touch and their purchasing stuff/verification process is less effective than letting a teacher go to a store and buy some crayons while they're on sale insanely cheap for back to school.\n\nI'm very **VERY** disappointed in this change.  :(\n\neta:  someone asked me to include this https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/ "], [398, "Strongly dislike this change.\n\nThe problem with DonorsChoose is it rewards teachers that are better at pitching their need.  Gifts for teachers was easy and teachers that weren't great at marketing could still get help with basic supplies.\n\nInstead, it's a social media contest where the teachers have to compete with each other for dollars."], [363, "As great as this is, I'd much prefer the more personal interactions of having the 'exchange' on RedditGifts. Most of the 'requests' I've read through have been for field trips, professional development, and specific stacks of books, instead of general calls for school supplies and basic classroom necessities. In a way, this creates a hierarchy - what good will sending a group of fourth-graders to see Hamilton on Broadway when the first-graders in the same school don't have enough colored pencils or notebook paper?\n\nNot that I won't participate, but hopefully next year we'll go back to the 'old' way, when it was more personal and (IMO) more focused on what's needed, not what's wanted.\n\n**Edit:** Per the request of some other Redditors, I'd like to draw your attention to: *[the boycott thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/)*"], [299, "As a Canadian teacher, and supporter of the old way of doing the teacher exchange, I'm disappointed.

One year, despite donating a classroom's worth of Scientific calculators (not cheap), I received no thanks. This did not stop me from signing up a second year and donating supplies again. I don't need to be thanked. Sure, it's disappointing. It's nice to see what you've contributed to, but it's not an expectation or requirement. \n\nWhat I enjoy more is how personal the interaction is. A *person* has asked for help. Specific help. Not money help, but I need: crayons, craft paper, books, etc. Things that lots of teachers do need help getting for their students, that enrich learning-- because it's not being provided, and they already make so little. Things that for $120 or so, I can easily provide and know that I'm helping not only the teacher, but all the students. I've made their life a little less stressful, and enriched the lives of students. I see it. I'm a part of it. It's tiny, and a small role, but this is me being selfish, this is the part that I enjoy.\n\nYou've removed it. You've made it like kickstarter, or crowdfunding. I have to go through lists, and lists, and lists, and lists, and lists of people-- people in need, and pick one (or two). Looking at some of these requests, I wouldn't even see a resolution. A macbook air? 3d printer? software? -- I'm on page 20 and I already feel helpless. I don't even know which ones are Redditors. This *feels* horrible. DonorsChoose will get a percentage for the platform providing it, and some will get more visibility than others. It's a solution where you throw money at it and you don't really know what happens, and in the process probably get some automated message of 'THANKS!' sent out to all the people who contributed to the particular wish, which feels even more thankless than no thank you at all.\n\nIt's not \"redditgifts\", which is about person-to-person interaction. It's, \"Please donate money, thanks, bye.\" You're selling something that doesn't fit what RedditGifts is.\n\nI realize you've mentioned the undertaking is huge. I'm sure it's terribly hard on your employees, with the work-life balance. I'm sure it probably has financial drawbacks for your company. I'm sure there's lots of reasons you chose to do it this way, and there was lots of meetings with lots of minds -- but I'm not buying how great \"DonorsChoose\" is. I'm sorry. I feel you missed the mark. I'd prefer to offer solutions rather than just criticism, but I don't understand the true motivations behind the choice, though the spidey-sense is financial (translates on many levels: people time, etc).\n\nI wont be donating this year. It makes me feel horrible, and now I'm seriously questioning whether to do any future RG events.\n\nBest Wishes,\nthecotton\n\n"], [50, "An FYI for teachers looking for books...

It\u2019s one of the great joys of my life, to be honest, because of the incredible positive energy that comes from it.  \n\n\nAs you can see, today we announced some changes to \u2018Reddit Gifts for the Teachers\u2019, and I think we could have better explained why we made these changes.  I\u2019m sorry that we didn\u2019t explain it well up front.   The teacher\u2019s exchange was a very well regarded program, but the honest truth is our volunteer mods, staff, and users across the board were having to devote far more time to this program than was usual for our other programs.  It was clear to the Reddit Gifts team that in its previous state, Reddit Gifts for the Teachers was simply not a feasible program to continue pursuing - so much that we debated discontinuing it entirely.\n\n\nHowever, when it became clear that we could get the best of both worlds - continue to make life easier for talented educators, upholdthe spirit of this program, and to reduce our overhead cost by partnering with DonorsChoose.org, we did not hesitate to jump at the chance! Reddit and DonorsChoose.org have a long, long history of doing good together: there\u2019s [Colbert](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ddc0w/update_in_less_than_eight_hours_the_colbertrally/), [Ohanian](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nfx00/iama_cofounder_of_reddit_alexis_ohanian_amaath/), and heck, even [Reddit Gifts](https://www.donorschoose.org/redditgifts) who have all worked with this organization in the past. [Charity Navigator rates them](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=9284) an 96.66 out of 100. This makes them one of the most highly regarded charities in America.\n\n\nWe knew that there might be strong reaction to this decision, but I\u2019m saddened that we may have made it worse by failing to anticipate the depths of that emotion., I mentioned this in a previous post, and I\u2019ll say it again\u2014my sincerity may not read through in text, but we\u2019ve done what we felt was best for the longevity of giving to those who need it most. Yes, change is hard, especially when it means we\u2019re missing out on giving to international classrooms, but when we looked at the financial sustainability of RedditGifts as a whole, this compromise was far preferable to eliminating the giving program entirely. In hindsight, bringing this change to the community beforehand probably would have been a better option.  We didn\u2019t, because traditionally Reddit Gifts has had a rule that we don\u2019t disclose what we have planned for upcoming batches.  We should have diverged from that rule here.\n\n\nI\u2019m very sorry that so many people were disappointed with this decision - but there is still good to be had, I\u2019m sure of it. Already today, Redditors have helped completely fund multiple projects, and received thank you notes from those teachers.

I've decided on the opinion that this event should be boycotted because it misleads people who would donate.**\n\nAs a teacher in America who could benefit from this, I'm disappointed in the decision to team up with DonorsChoose. This is supposed to be a reddit event, but it seems like total control has been given to DonorsChoose, and reddit is simply being used to link to DC and advertise their website.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there is no connection to reddit beyond attaching its name to DonorsChoose for one month and *maybe* tracking how much money redditors donate.\n\nBut is the money going to other redditors? Today is the first day of this program, so let's take a look at who is asking for what...\n\nLanguage & Literacy: 300 requests\n\nMath & Science: 289 requests\n\nMusic & the Arts: 302 requests\n\nApplied Learning: 296 requests\n\nHealth & Sports: 307 requests\n\nHistory & Civics: 308 requests\n\nSpecial Needs: 299 requests\n\nI think it's very unlikely that 2,101 redditors signed up in the past hour, considering that's 12% of all teachers who received gifts last year, and this isn't taking into account that this year is US-only.\n\nLooking a bit closer, I notice that the teachers who are listed on the RedditGifts+DonorsChoose alliance have [projects that began before RedditGifts for Teachers 2016 began](http://i.imgur.com/ki45p7d.png).\n\nThis isn't a reddit event. It's DonorsChoose using reddit to accomplish *their* mission.\n\nIf reddit admins can't fulfill their ambitions, they should just not do the project. I think this is deceptive to reddit donors. The way this is presented makes it seem like redditors are helping redditors.\n\nCharity is great, but there's always at least a little bit of self-interest when donating to charity. In the case of Reddit Gifts for Teachers, that self-interest comes in the form of redditors wanting to help other redditors. We're a community, and we want to feel like we're giving back to our own community. Sure, there are likely many redditors who don't care to make this distinction, but they can go to DonorsChoose themselves and donate; they don't need Reddit to advertise for them to do this.\n\nI think my point is driven home when we consider the issues people have had in previous years. Many people complained that Reddit Gifts for Teachers was unsustainable because non-redditors would sign up in August just to receive gifts, but never contribute to reddit the community. I saw a lot of people suggesting ideas like limiting sign-ups to redditors with accounts at least x days/months/years old or with y amount of comments/karma to ensure that redditors are actually helping members of their own community.\n\nInstead of going with those suggestions, it seems RedditGifts admins went the opposite direction and decided that there is no longer a need to feign membership at reddit at all to receive gifts. All a teacher needs is a DonorsChoose project to receive charity from redditors.\n\nPerhaps the project should be marketed as *DonorsChoose: Funded by Reddit*, but that honesty wouldn't attract charitable redditors who care about the distinction being glossed over.\n\nI appreciate all the work Reddit Gifts admins have done in the past, I recognize their passion to help teachers, and I understand the difficulties that come with this mission...but I do not agree with the direction they decided to take. It seems disingenuous in nature and disrespectful to the generous redditors who have invested in this project in the past.\n\nAm I wrong in my assessment in this?

Even if you have no money, if you can pass a background check I'm sure they would love to have you volunteer for students to read with you. What would be really excellent is if everyone who reads this comment found a local teacher and they adopt their classroom for a year, providing supplies and help as it is needed. \n\nKeep in mind that often times a teacher wants things, but the way that the system is set up is (unfortunately) in such a way that a teacher often feels guilty for asking for anything, or as if their needs aren't quite as necessary as another.

That way you'll be supporting low income schools instead of those privileged areas that make you feel uncomfortable.  Personally, I taught at a title one school in one of the poorest areas in the U.S. and I used donors choose to get things that were essential to my first graders that I couldn't afford to buy out of pocket.

I could afford to buy crayons, pencils, and paper for my students.  I couldn't afford to buy them a classroom library.  So some things may appear extravagant, but actually be a necessity (obviously not in reference to the trip to China).  \n\nEdit: (remembered something else) Additionally big businesses like Chevron will fulfill all requests made in certain states during certain time periods so teachers sometimes ask for crazy extravagant items (like excessive new technology or large trips) because it's the only way to get it and it will definitely get funded.

One year, despite donating a classroom's worth of Scientific calculators (not cheap), I received no thanks. This did not stop me from signing up a second year and donating supplies again. I don't need to be thanked. Sure, it's disappointing. It's nice to see what you've contributed to, but it's not an expectation or requirement. \n\nWhat I enjoy more is how personal the interaction is. A *person* has asked for help. Specific help. Not money help, but I need: crayons, craft paper, books, etc. Things that lots of teachers do need help getting for their students, that enrich learning-- because it's not being provided, and they already make so little. Things that for $120 or so, I can easily provide and know that I'm helping not only the teacher, but all the students. I've made their life a little less stressful, and enriched the lives of students. I see it. I'm a part of it. It's tiny, and a small role, but this is me being selfish, this is the part that I enjoy.\n\nYou've removed it. You've made it like kickstarter, or crowdfunding. I have to go through lists, and lists, and lists, and lists, and lists of people-- people in need, and pick one (or two). Looking at some of these requests, I wouldn't even see a resolution. A macbook air? 3d printer? software? -- I'm on page 20 and I already feel helpless. I don't even know which ones are Redditors. This *feels* horrible. DonorsChoose will get a percentage for the platform providing it, and some will get more visibility than others. It's a solution where you throw money at it and you don't really know what happens, and in the process probably get some automated message of 'THANKS!' sent out to all the people who contributed to the particular wish, which feels even more thankless than no thank you at all.\n\nIt's not \"redditgifts\", which is about person-to-person interaction. It's, \"Please donate money, thanks, bye.\" You're selling something that doesn't fit what RedditGifts is.\n\nI realize you've mentioned the undertaking is huge. I'm sure it's terribly hard on your employees, with the work-life balance. I'm sure it probably has financial drawbacks for your company. I'm sure there's lots of reasons you chose to do it this way, and there was lots of meetings with lots of minds -- but I'm not buying how great \"DonorsChoose\" is. I'm sorry. I feel you missed the mark. I'd prefer to offer solutions rather than just criticism, but I don't understand the true motivations behind the choice, though the spidey-sense is financial (translates on many levels: people time, etc).\n\nI wont be donating this year.
