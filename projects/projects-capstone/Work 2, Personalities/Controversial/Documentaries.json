Isn't it a little arrogant to assume that humans are it, that we're number one, that we can know everything? Who's to say there isn't some force or reality or being(s) that we simply can't perceive, like how a dog can't ever know or understand calculus? I think it's a real possibility. And yeah, Dawkins sort of alludes to this at the end of the documentary, but he's more skeptical.\n\nHe's also way oversimplifying religion in general. He's focusing on the extremists, the loonies. He makes sweeping generalizations that a scientist like him should know better than to make. He's drawing on himself for authority, assuming that he knows everything. He's falling into the same trap that religious extremists fall into: \"I know that I'm right, and everyone else is wrong, and there is no possibility that anyone else is right.\" Obviously Dawkins' arrogance doesn't manifest itself in ways as harmful as that of religious extremists, but it's still concerning.\n\nModerate (read: the majority of) religious people recognize that religion doesn't explain everything. One of the first chapters of the Rig Veda pretty much says \"we can't really say for sure who created the world.\" But if nothing else, it teaches us how to not be assholes. I was raised Catholic and taught that it's okay to question things. And I openly disagree with some of the stuff the church teaches.\n\nI took a world religions class this past semester, and my professor said to us one day, after the Paris attacks and a number of other violent events that happened closer to home, that \"we're forgetting to be human to each other.\" And that really struck a chord. I think that religion, when done right, teaches us to see the human in everyone. Jesus said to love your enemies, did he not? I know that being raised Catholic has played a huge part in how I see the world and other people. \n\nAnd religion creates communities, it brings people together. Yes, of course you must be careful not to promote stuff like groupthink. You don't want to brainwash people. And that's a slippery slope sometimes.

And being raised Catholic was a hugely positive influence on how I interact with others. I'm still cool with gay marriage and there's no stigma for me. I'm still pro-choice, because I think it's actually more \"pro-life\" to be pro-choice. The Catholic church teaches that evolution is true, as do most moderate Christians. Only those crazy evangelicals teach creationism still.\n\nI guess I'm a \"cafeteria Catholic.\" I don't completely follow all of the official teachings. Honestly I don't really even go to church anymore. But being raised in the religion was a good foundation, because if nothing else, I learned how to be a good person. \n\nLook at the 10 commandments. The first few deal with your relationship with God, but most of them are about how you interact with others: be good to your parents, don't hurt or kill people, don't steal, don't fuck someone you aren't married to, and don't lie. Obviously humans have chosen to bend that stuff for their own purposes over the years, but at its core, it's really just common sense. \n\nWhen some guy asked Jesus what the most important rule was, he basically said \"don't be an asshole. Treat other people how you want them to treat you.\" And when he talked about Judgement Day, when he would come back and send all the good people to heaven and the shitty ones to hell, he talked about what exactly he'd say. \"When I was hungry and thirsty you gave me relief, when I was sick or homeless you helped me, etc, because when you did this for the most vulnerable members of society you did it for me. And those of you going to hell, you didn't do this stuff, so that's why you're in hell now.\" Nothing about gay marriage or premarital sex or any of that shit.\n\nAnd then people get into arguments about how God talked to the people who wrote the Bible and so this is the direct word of God, right? Maybe. Probably not. But someone, somewhere wrote it, and it makes a whole lot of sense.

Still, the refusal to believe that the giant jet fuel-filled airliners that smashed into the towers was the actual cause of their collapse is so ridiculous as to be beyond belief.  \n\nEntertaining the idea that there was some sort of conspiracy, which is completely impossible because of the number of people who would have be involved and remain silent, why would you orchestrate plane crashes and then use bombs to blow up the buildings?  Why not just use bombs and blame them on jihadists.  It doesn't make sense for conspiracy theorists to award, on the one hand, enormous competence to the conspirators in terms of the organization and bureaucracy involved, and then devise an overly complex plan involving airliners and bombs.  The reason airliners were in play is that it was the only way for the jihadis to deliver enough firepower to do serious damage.  \n\nThe jets which hit the buildings caused their collapse.

It's also true that traveling at a low altitude at more than 500 miles per hour, you need a target which is easily visible.  The WTC and Pentagon both fit this bill.  Al-Qaeda's modus operandi was to kill people dramatically in order to further their political ends in the Middle East, not to complete destroy the United States.  Bin Laden was a competent engineer; and hitting a dam or nuclear plant would kill many less people right away, and might fail to cause a cascade failure in either piece of infrastructure.  Video exists of bin Laden discussing the 9/11 attacks and claiming that he was also surprised that both towers collapsed; he had assumed that only the top few floors would collapse. \n\nAs for why no planes were shot down--using jets as missiles was a concept which had been discussed only in very niche areas of the national security establishment prior to 9/11.

The entire infrastructural and national security establishment of the United States would have to be in on it, and keeping such a secret would be impossible.  \n\nAnd, like I said, what was the point of the planes if they were just going to blow up the building with explosives?

You really got me there.\n\nThe article actually had many economists shitting on Trump, you didn't read it, I just copy pasted one of them. PS: Trump isn't an economist, he's less credible than economists are.\n\n>> Ok, I'm done eviscerating you for your feeble attempt at discrediting Trump's economic policies by countering them with some nobody who works in a city that is in ruins.\n\nAre you living in some alternate reality? You didn't refute a single argument made, you displayed that you don't understand how colleges work, and basically just threw out one massive ad hominem in place of an argument. \n\n\n>> Those trade deals for the raw materials? This is going to come as a shock to you, get ready. Trump plans on renegotiating those piss poor trade deals.\n\nLmao, sure thing sport. \"poor trade deals\" right, I'm sure Trump is ranked the most economically illiterate person in the race because he's a master trader!\n\n\n>> will be negligible and the pivot away from nightmarish free trade policies will bring manufacturing jobs home instead of receiving goods made by Chinese slave labor. The resulting boost in American jobs is what we call a, \"net gain.\"\n\nAgain, you show pure economic illiteracy. I've already provided multiple credible sources shitting on your argument, to which you responded with a giant ad hominem fueled by ignorance and economic illiteracy.\n\nHere are the other economists that said he was wrong.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kudlow\n\nhttp://premierespeakers.com/lindsey_piegza/bio\n\n", "id": "d5elbxl"}, {"comment": "Quote from first article in which you claim reinforces your foolish claim that, \"manufacturing is coming back,\":\n\nWhy is this significant? 2014\u2019s net increase of at least 10,000 jobs was the first net gain in at least 20 years, Harry Moser, the Reshoring Initiative\u2019s founder and president, told MarketWatch. \u201cThe trend in manufacturing in the U.S. is to source domestically,\u201d Moser said. \u201cWith 3 [million] to 4 million manufacturing jobs still offshore, we see huge potential for even more growth.\u201d\n\nTHE FIRST NET GAIN IN AT LEAST 20 YEARS.

Instead of rewarding their insane risk taking with bailouts when they fuck up, you let them fail. Currently they don't have to compete, because they can take the most insane high risk/reward opportunities, because risk has effectively been removed for them. They know that if it fails, the tax payers foot the bill.\n\nFurthermore, while Bernie is not a pacifist or an isolationist, he wants to downsize the military. Reconsidering whether there should be a hostile military presence by American forces in like 9 countries concurrently does seem insane, and keeping people stashed in military bases around the world in every country also seems a bit much. And the black budget is gigantic, and there's too much reliance on contractor work that inflates the bill for tasks and services the military can handle internally for a fraction of the cost.\n\nThen there are tax loopholes that allow some of the richest to not only not pay taxes, but effectively paying negative tax, because they pay essentially nothing in tax, and get huge government subsidies, which amounts to being a negative tax. Closing these loopholes would allow for more money to trickle into US government coffers, and that money would be available for spending elsewhere.\n\nThen you have legalization of drugs like marijuana. The war on drugs has been a surrealistic idea since it's inception. You don't solve a problem like drug abuse by making it illegal. This has been tried with other substances from alcohol to nicotine to caffeine and then other drugs. People create black markets and it causes more suffering than if it was legal and controlled.\n\nLegalizing marijuana and some other low level drugs and opening up for medicinal research on a wider array of drugs would allow for spending less money on what are effectively victimless crimes. Sure drugs ruin lives, and cartel violence is anything but victimless, but if you legalize them, there's no longer a point in having a black market economy for these substances. The cartels would lose ground, as official licensed and recognized establishments with trusted quality control and a well documented supply line would be preferable, it would likely also be cheaper this way so there's another incentive. And that's even despite the fact that you'd naturally be taxing these drugs and reaping huge benefits there.\n\nNow. A single payer healthcare system would allow the government to negotiate prices of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, pushing down the cost of healthcare. It would also mean that everyone has access to healthcare for a very reasonable cost, which means that more people will go see a doctor while a problem is still manageable, and not wait until it's an emergency. The growth in use of preventative medicine will mean people can live healthier for longer, and thus work longer as well, with fewer sick days off, and more happiness. More work means more productivity means more spending power, and more tax revenue.\n\nA socialized school structure need not get rid of all private school institutions but would be an investment into America's future. Unless you believe that only children of wealthy parents can be sharp enough to benefit from higher education, then you'd everyone to have an opportunity to get into higher education, based on merit rather than basing it on what your parents can afford.\n\nIt makes no sense to disqualify talented, intelligent kids from getting quality education up to and including higher education, if you want to strengthen your nation. You'd want as many sharp and well educated people as possible, right? So with a limited pool, why is the gating mechanism currently more to do with your social standing and your family wealth?\n\nNot to say that Bernie Sanders is the perfect candidate.

For example Marxist feminism is opposed to liberal feminism; each opposed to the others understanding of feminism, of the origin of patriarchy, their goals, practical application, and more. \n    \n>So why do I have such a strong dislike for feminism (which I don't have for atheism)?  \n  \nI can't answer that. There are certainly atheists who do very much dislike the atheists of /r/atheism. ", "id": "cz8rajy"}, {"comment": "> I'd recommend actually reading about it from feminist theorists, or at least introductory texts by feminist academics.\n\nI did try to find some sort of authoritative definition (or, at the very least, an 'agreed upon' part of it) so that I could know whether the \u201c4chan of feminism\u201d as you put it are misusing the term or not. But everything about feminism is wishy-washy or incomprehensible.\n\nJust now, I tried to search 'introductory feminism' and got this:\n\n> [The term 'feminism' has many different uses and its meanings are often contested.](http://www.mit.edu/~shaslang/papers/femintro.html#2)\n\nThen I followed the Wikipedia references to the 'patriarchy' article and got this:\n\n> [The literal and historical meaning of 'patriarchy' is 'the rule of fathers'. Although there is no consensus on the contemporary definition of the term, many feminists have extended it beyond the realm of family to include the rule of men over women more generally](https://books.google.ca/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&pg=PA1197&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\nJesus, is there *any* agreement anywhere in the movement?\nI mean, knowing that Julia the feminist academic uses a sensible definition of patriarchy is nigh useless if no one but Julia uses the word like that.\n\n\n> I'm not particularly interested in it either, especially a screenshot of an out-of-context conversation (even the comment karma is suspiciously covered) or a thread where the entire topic and all but one of the comments are deleted.\n\nI can't speak to the nuked thread as that's the mods' doing. As for the screenshot, I did that because although I think that person has very na\u00efve opinions (if not downright stupid), I still don't endorse harrassment, so I am making it as hard as possible for wackos out there to find out their reddit username (besides, who they are is irrelevant, what's important to me is that people do think and say stuff like that). If you really care to know whether it's true, there are ways to find the source with enough Google-fu (alternatively, I can send you the link by PM).\n\n\n> /r/feminism and its mods have been subject for criticism by feminists on reddit for years. There have been several alternative subs for feminists to gather - rest assured the mods banned these people as well so it's not some sort of feminist conspiracy to censor, the mods of the sub are just terrible.\n\nHmm\u2026 while I see what you mean (and maybe there are similar situations with other movements), I think this certainly reflects badly on feminism as a movement.\n\nI will however concede that as a philosophy, I have less quarrel with it. But being part of a movement doesn't mean agreeing in part or in full, with the underlying philosophy. It means agreeing with the movement or how that philosophy is used to pursue certain goals. And that is the part that I\u00a0largely have problems with.\n\nPersonally, I think that 'feminism' is a bad name to begin with. If anything, something whose [etymology is 'doctrine of the female sex'](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=feminism&allowed_in_frame=0) should probably be only about that and not about equality in general (and if it does, I think it should be expected to be twisted in other directions too). I mean, I would expect trouble if someone wanted to promote atheism under the name 'nonretardism' or 'truthism' or some such loaded name.\n\nThat being said, if you have resources on what patriarchy means for some reasonable academic, I'm open to reading suggestions.

I'm also remember seeing live footage of the North Tower collapsing and seeing a giant multi-story section of outer perimeter columns collapsing into the direction of the WTC 7 building across the street. I also saw pictures of the immense damage done by those falling sections. Testimonials from firefighters on the scene who saw the immense damage done. And, thank you, I couldn't recall the exact number of perimeter columns of the WTC 7 building. Brilliant reminder. As for their support, a building is only as strong as its weakest link. Buildings depend on their structure to be sound. When many critical failures occur to a structure, it sometimes results in collapse. That's what happened. I've been to a controlled demolition of a multi-story building at my university, and it's loud, very loud. There isn't a super-secret way of knocking a building down with explosives without making tremendous noise. Every video I've seen of the WTC 7 collapsing has no signs of explosions going off. Not only that, but if there were explosions, from the shockwave you would literally have windows of surrounding buildings shattered all around the WTC 7. And that simply isn't the case. \n> \n> They just suddenly all vaporized?\n\nNo.\n\n> No skyscraper has ever come down in this manner  and not been a controlled demolition.\n\nThere was a specific set of events and conditions present that have never occurred in history that day, I think you're forgetting this fact. \n\n> It is absurd to argue that that could have been the result of asymmetrical damage and office fires.

This one is particularly interesting:\n\n>Being an American myself who has actually visited Cuba within the last year, I find the other reviews of this documentary to be completely misguided. Like them, I first saw this documentary and believed that Castro wasn't actually such a bad guy, but that the U.S. and Cuban exiles were biased and portrayed him as a monster. When I met several Cuban exiles who emotionally told me the stories of how they had their houses taken away by Castro and how their parents were tortured and placed in rat-infested prisons for simply expressing their support democracy, I thought these Cuban exiles were exaggerating. However, after I visited Cuba last year, I have to painfully admit that these people were correct in the stories they told me. I went to Cuba expecting to see racial equality, free healthcare and free education, as people like Ted Turner and Steven Spielberg had claimed existed in Cuba. What I learned from actually speaking to people in Cuba during my trip was a competely different picture from that portrayed of Castro in this documentary. Not to mention, I expected to see beautiful, exotic buildings. However, what I actually saw was building after building in Havana crumbling, with no electricity and on average, there were five to six families living in one two-story house. In one house I visited, the roof was partially torn off, one family of three lived under the staircase, two families lived in the kitchen, and three families lived upstairs, which consisted of two bedrooms and one closet. Very, very sad. Each day they had to wait in a line for two hours to just to get one ration of bread and rice. When I asked one of the mothers about the school system she explained that all children who attended were required to denounce any \"counterrevolutionary activity\" they saw at home to their teachers. As a result, many Cuban parents went to jail because one of their children notified authorities that their parents were \"disagreeing\" with the government some way. Imagine being placed in jail because U.S. law states your child must tell his third grade teacher he overheard you say \"I disagree with the Iraq war and dislike President Bush\" at your kitchen table. I also learned that when school children participate in a government march for the communist party they're given a coupon, which must be given to their teachers the following day to prove they participated. If they don't turn in their your coupon, the teacher will make a notation on a report card that each Cuban student carries from kindergarten until he graduates from high school. In addition to information about the student participation in all political activities, the report card also has information about his family including whether his parents belong to the Communist Party, a Committee for the Defense of the Revolution or the CTC or Confederation of Cuban Workers. In pre-Castro Cuba, the CTC used to represent Cuban workers and demand new benefits and better salaries for them. In Castro's Cuba, however, the CTC, exploits the workers, treating them as if they were slaves. The poor Cuban workers have to pay a fee to the CTC from their meager salaries in order to be \"represented\" by them. I was in such shock to learn these facts that I am now firmly convinced there is no such thing as a \"free educational system\" in Cuba.\n\n>As my conversations with Havana locals turned to the issue of free healthcare, praised by many ignorant Americans (myself having been one of them before this trip), I became even more distraught at the truth about healthcare in Cuba. The truth is that Castro has built excellent health facilities for the use of FOREIGNERS who pay hard currency for medical services. However, Cuban citizens are not even allowed to visit those facilities ! Cubans who require medical attention must go to other hospitals, that lack the most minimum requirements needed to take care of their patients. Most hospitals are filthy and patients have to bring their own towels, bed sheets, pillows, or they have to lay down on dirty bare mattresses stained with blood and other body fluids. Next time you hear someone say that Cubans receive \"excellent free healthcare\" (as I once used to say) please think again because that is simply not true. I spoke to five people whose family members died while attempting to \"float\" to Florida on dangerous, man-made rafts because they were so desperate to escape Fidel Castro's regime. Most people I spoke to were afraid to answer my question \"Do you like Castro?\" But their silence and weary down-turned eyes spoke volumes about the truth. Most people HATE Castro and think he is selfish, oppressive monster who has banked millions of dollars while the Cuban people starve and wait in line for rations of bread. I came back from my trip to Cuba a changed person. I felt so stupid and ignorant for having believed this documentary and other statements made by American actors and directors such as Sydney Pollack, Danny Glover, Steven Spielberg, Jack Nicholson and Kevin Costner, that portrayed Castro as \"brilliant\" and Cuba as having \"excellent healthcare and education.\" If you watch this documentary you should also watch the movie \"The Lost City.\" This movie is the story of a Cuban family during the Cuban Revolution and ACCURATELY shows you both pre-Castro and post-Castro Cuba. It depicts how Castro's government slowly began eliminating free press any semblance of property rights and freedom. The movie is fair because it portrays both points of view--one brother in the movie supports Castro and the other disagrees with Castro. The cab driver I had while I was in Havana told me that, being 75 years old, he had experienced both pre-Castro and post-Castro Cuba. When Castro took power he was poor and believed in socialism and the revolution. But now, 45 years later, he is no better off than he was before. At least before Castro, he told me, he had better healthcare, a better house and freedom to express his religious beliefs (Castro closed all churches and essentially banned religion) and political beliefs. Perhaps the saddest part of my trip, which still resonates in my head today, was how this old man just kept repeating over and over \"I should have left in 1959. I should have known.

But what\nreally is happening is that the director and the film crew and the subjects are\ncollaborating to simulate a reality in which they pretend the camera is not\npresent. It\u2019s a kind of dishonest story about how the film was made that\nperforms a useful function \u2014 namely it helps us to suspend our\ndisbelief and perceive that simulation as reality,\" he said.\n\n\"People who would have us believe that the masterpieces of\ndirect cinema \u2014 and to be sure, there are masterpieces of direct cinema \u2014 would\nask us to believe that if the camera is there long enough, the mother and the\nchild will forget that the camera crew will behave as though it\u2019s not there.\nThat\u2019s absurd. That\u2019s just idiocy. No one forgets the presence of the camera,\nno matter how long it\u2019s there. All documentaries are performance. They are\nperformance precisely where people are playing themselves,\" said Oppenheimer.\n\nHe continued, \"If we throw away the myth of fly-on-the-wall and ask what\nis a more helpful understanding of what\u2019s happening in documentary film when it\nreally soars, when it\u2019s really explosive, when it\u2019s really wonderful, what\u2019s\nhappening is a situation within the overall safe space of the filmmaking process,\nand the efforts that are taken to protect the safety of people when a film is\nreleased, within that overall framework, scenes are set up that cut to the core\nof what the most important issues are in the film in which everybody \u2014 filmmaker,\nparticipant, crew \u2013 is pushed beyond their comfort zone\nand things are allowed to spiral somewhat out of control. That\u2019s when\ndocumentary film becomes genuinely cinematic. Until that happens, it\u2019s mere\nsimulation.\"*  \n[Here is a link](https://youtu.be/SWzXPQ3Qydc?t=34m56s) to a talk at Sundance with Oppenheimer & Werner Herzog discussing this question of \"What is the definition of documentary?

I showed him djoser's pyramid and the bent pyramid (both of which he was unaware of, probably because of the source of his information) to show that there was an evolution of design to them. I explained about even the mayan pyramids were constructed differently than the egyptian ones.  I also told him about other pyramids he didnt know about either (qinshihuangdi's pyramid).  I then explained how it isnt hard to imagine disconnected cultures building similar structures when all you have is dirt and stone one of the most stable structures you can build will be a pyramid. I went on to explain how even the pyramids around the world were built with different purposes in mind.

They live where they can afford. They also don't choose to be black. And finally they have little to no influence over the actions of others.

This is just common sense. A cop cannot be of the same vigilance if he or she goes to an area with low crime compared to an area with high crime. Nor am I saying that cops should treat black people more aggressively. I know too many do but I also believe there is more of a culture of not following police orders within the black community than others and probably much more aggression towards police which would cause the police to react. \n\nOther minorities like Hispanics live in the exact same neighborhoods in the same poverty and yet still have a much lower murder rate and rate of killing cops, yielding a proportional shot by police rate to the population. Random black guy #22 shouldn't be responsible for other black crime but given the data it's unrealistic to at least expect that it will account for something. Should we treat men as pedophiles and rapists until proven otherwise? Of course not. But certainly men are more likely than women to commit those crimes and so men as a whole *are* rightly preconceived as more likely to commit those crimes than women. It's just facts and facts are stubborn things. We don't live in a vacuum. \n\nChange the system how exactly? I believe a starting approach is recognizing these facts and to stop perpetuating lies. Many people see these lies and get pissed off, which only causes further divide. In order to even start thinking of a solution it's important to do so with all the facts on the table and by not letting our biases get in the way. What can be done? Well, a start would be bringing down the black crime rate and that's something that black people have to look within as a people to solve because the only thing that everyone else can do is either more or less policing, each controversial in its own right. There needs to be more black police officers, but again, those police forces are looking but aren't finding applicants. So that too is something that the black community needs to do some soul-searching about. \n\nPolice have a right to not die during their shift so eliminating police guns in areas that are full of them is ridiculous. However, more training should be done to make sure that deadly force is only used when necessary. Also I believe that all police forces should have body cameras at all times to protect against both the police and the citizens. Every single year more white people are killed by police than black people so it's not like this is a black only problem. I understand blacks are disproportionately killed from the rate of their population by about double but considering that murders and violence are disproportionately double or more - and in the case of murder about about 400% more - there's a reason for that. Using your other example, men are killed by police at much higher rates than females, and there's a reason for that too.

The reason for that mistrust was because cops, as instruments of the state, have long abused the black community. Its a very chicken or egg situation.\n\nAnd again, you are saying 2 different things. Either statistics should factor in during the \"rational\" evaluation or they should not. If they do they will inevitably predispose and lead to different treatment for some based on demographics.

You copy and pasted only a part of a sentence I said and didn't quote the second have where I said, \"but.\" I said \"it should be in the back of their heads as cops if they want to make it home alive given the clear statistical facts on the matter\" and that \"Random black guy #22 shouldn't be responsible for other black crime **but** given the data it's unrealistic to at least expect that it will account for something.\" That doesn't mean treating people differently but being aware of different probability of dangers. Like say there's two different animals but one has a much higher probability of biting you. You can go and pet both animals and treat both animals the same but the known facts of the situation would make it so that you would be more vigilant of something going wrong in the situation with the higher probability of something going wrong, even though, until something does, they are both treated equally. I'm saying we don't live in a vacuum and that the animal with a higher probability of biting you, even if that specific one hasn't, will bear the rational evaluation of said statistical data to keep in the back of your head.\n\n> The reason for that mistrust was because cops, as instruments of the state, have long abused the black community. Its a very chicken or egg situation.\n\nUnderstood. But the police forces in these communities have been extending olive branches for a long time for more applicants. It would be preferable for more applicants from dangerous communities so that the police could build trust and a cop that patrols the very same area he or she grew up is important because it will blur the line of \"us vs them.\" The police *are* us, made up of regular people like you and me. I know there a small percentage of bad cops but there are a small percentage of bad people in every profession. \n\n> You cannot have it both ways. You cannot claim individual responsibility but then shift to collective responsibility and claim some amorphous \"black community\" is responsible for changing it. It's not like it's a voluntary association. In saying the \"black community\" should do so, you are in fact saying random black guy #22 has a responsibility to fix it, despite random black guy #22 doesn't know random criminal #35. The only thing they have in common is being black. Which, again, is not a club or political association.\n\nUnless the statistics of black crime such as probability of attacking police officers goes down then it will always make sense to be more vigilant around them as a cop. Things can go 0-60 in an instant and they need to have it in the back of their mind that something can go wrong in every situation but it's about odds. Again, that doesn't mean treating people differently, but being more vigilant with known facts. You brought up males and females and that's a perfect example. Cops treat both equally but they are certainly more vigilant around males because statistics show that males are more likely to attack them than females are. We cannot ignore probability. Males have a collective responsibility for changing these statistics if they want this association to change, even though they are born into it and have no influence other each other. It's not fair, but it's logical. \n\nAlso, there are things that the black community can do as a people which I haven't seen much, like get angry about black on black crime in their communities. When's the last time you saw a nationwide protest for black on black crime? No, it's only when a white cop shoots a black person, which happens at a very low rate in comparison, that people get angry and organize. It's a common refrain I see to mention how the majority of white people are killed by other whites and that nobody is talking about \"white on white crime.\" That, though, is a complete misunderstanding of how statistics work. With white people representing about 77% in this statistical data and black people representing about 13% we absolutely must look at the data correctly.\n\nWhite people kill each other about 82% of the time and black people kill white people about 14% of the time. Black people kill other black people about 91% of the time and white people kill black people about 7% of the time. So black people kill white people at double the rate of white on black first of all. And if we look at the raw numbers black people kill other black people about 2,500 times a year and white people kill other white people about 2,600 times a year. Considering white people make up 77% and black people only 13%, those numbers of white on white crime is *nothing* compared to black on black crime. So when I hear this common refrain about how black on black crime is the same as white on white crime it shows me that they either don't understand math or that they do and are deliberately obfuscating the truth. How can the black crime rate go down when such information is not even being discussed within the black community in an open and honest manner. Black people as a community online or otherwise could get angry and protest over this black on black crime to do something about it and show they care, but they don't. How can the rate go down without even showing that it matters? Black lives matter only when they are killed by a white person. This is the soul-searching I'm talking about and police shootings have absolutely no influence over this - it's the other way around. \n\nI think it's great that you don't associate with those people and I know there are countless people like you. However, if Asian people were killing people at the rate black people do then Asians would be the ones who cops are more vigilant around based on the statistical data and they would bear this collective association. Many times police shooting people is justified like if they are shot while attacking a cop, and sometimes it is not. But generally the overall rate of shootings by police against a population is in line with the overall violence of that population. If overall violence and aggression of a population goes down so too will police shootings of that population. ", "id": "d67sxuz"}, {"comment": "It's both.

The fact it completely contradicts most of this doesn't matter anymore because you most likely won't hear of it as they dont report on it or you will automatically assume those who make the claims are idiots. \n\nThe truth is that with the recent wikileaks revelations that prove what a lot of people the media have dismissed as crazy have been saying. \n\nMainstream media bias influencing voters including publishing articles written directly by campaigns, burying negative/positive press, focusing on irrelevant controversy, ruthlessly ridiculing anyone with conflicting opinion usually by a panel discussion, \n\nIts been proven voting machines are easily hackable and the process has not only been demonstrated on a voting machine but voting machines used by DNC were shown to be hacked by exact same process in favor for Hillary. \n\nVoter purging in areas containing large numbers of voters who support certain candidate, when some voters investigated human intervention was evident however were always stone walled and were never able to escalate complaint for independent investigation or any kind of explication. \n\nCompliance in different levels and departments of government from DOJ, CIA, FBI, Military, Governors, Senators, The President, Secret Service, Banking, also many entities that were non governmental. \n\nThis years DNC Exit poll data frequently being dramatically above the margin for error that would indicate vote rigging, most cases were above 15% and in favor of Clinton, mainstream media explained exit polls as \"being an inaccurate tool to predict election outcomes used by media that have no official use\" this was thoroughly debunked by those who went on to show exit polls are actually an extremely accurate tool used to ensure digital or paper ballot interference and most countries allow a 2% margin of error before serious investigations will be undertaken into voter fraud (company who did DNC election are also used internationally and have excellent reputation) when confronted with this the media answered by canceling exit polls in remaining states.\n\nIllegal practices such as deliberately sabotaging rival campaigns by paid entities who use violence, voter fraud, collusion with conflicted parties... \n\nThese are just a handful of legitimate, documented cases of an unfair biased election that the US itself wouldn't hesitate to denounce and refuse to officially acknowledge them as legitimate.

There is something that all white men who have lived here like I must learn and know: that these individuals are a sub-race. They have neither the intellectual, mental, or emotional abilities to equate or to share equally with white men in any function of our civilization. I have given my life to try to bring them the advantages which our civilization must offer, but I have become well aware that we must retain this status: the superior and they the inferior. For whenever a white man seeks to live among them as their equals they will either destroy him or devour him. And they will destroy all of his work. Let white men from anywhere in the world, who would come to Africa, remember that you must continually retain this status; you the master and they the inferior like children that you would help or teach. Never fraternize with them as equals. Never accept them as your social equals or they will devour you.

The public school system by & large is a failure. \n\nAre you afraid he\u2019s going to divert our tax dollars needed for health, infrastructure, education etc. etc. into a military run amok with corruption at every level spending these funds on equipment we don\u2019t and can\u2019t use?\nToo Late.  \n\nAre you afraid he\u2019s going to build a wall along the Mexican American border.

Too Late. The media, owned by the 1%, has been ramping up this \u2018divide and conquer\u2019 tactic to their advantage successfully long before Trump came around.\n\nAre you afraid he going to deny global warming?  WAY WAY too late.  Sorry but it\u2019s too late in the day to reverse climate change - period.   We are factually past the tipping point. You are living in denial if you think there is anything we can do now.   Please find me scientific consensus that shows how we will actually be able to reverse it.   Babbling about \u201c\u2026well if all the countries in the world stopped today and just\u2026\u201d isn\u2019t \u2018real\u2019.   Yapping about how\u2026 \u201csomeone\u2019s going to build a space elevator or a new tech and then\u2026\u201d isn\u2019t a real solution either.\n\nAre you afraid he\u2019s going to enact restrictions on the internet? Too Late. And nothing the entities who own Hillary lock stock & barrel won\u2019t push for anyways.\n\nAre you afraid he\u2019s going to target unions or the middle class for extinction?  TOO late. \n\nHealth Care?  Too Late.  No puppet president makes any decisions on health care - the Insurance lobby is too powerful, too large and get exactly what they want each time. ObamaCare is all theirs & is why you pay more now than you did before.  \u201cBut I don\u2019t pay - the gov subsidizes me!\u201d - NOPE all of us who now pay double to triple more than we did before are the ones subsidizing you. \n\nBut if YOU DO vote for Trump - you will have decidedly dealt a powerful blow to the Republican Party AND the Democratic Party BOTH of which are owned by the same private interests of the 1%.   You will punish the Democrats who rigged it for Hillary and prove their failure to everyone else if Trump wins. \nWorst/Best case scenario Trump will only be a ONE term president because \u2018crazy\u2019 doesn\u2019t work for winning a 2nd term.  But there is also a VERY good chance he could be impeached, or worse/better, thus shortening his term.  All this avoids the lost time of \u2018Hillary the Witch\u2019 being a 2 term president.  And you know full well the powers that be will assure she becomes a 2 termer.  That SAVES us 8 years of business as usual which we can\u2019t afford anymore.  A vote for Trump gives a chance that Bernie could mount a more effective campaign again sooner than with Hillary in office for 2 terms.  A vote for Trump puts a crack in the two party bullshit system and gives a very good chance that in a short time we could have a FAR better choice of candidates for change than the two ass-clowns they\u2019ve forced on us to choose from.  A vote for Trump creates an imbalance and when there is imbalance in the system instead of death-grip control there are OPPORTUNITIES. (Don\u2019t worry Trump won\u2019t be \u2018pushing the button\u2019 - it doesn\u2019t quite work that way otherwise we would have all been incinerated long ago).  Trump will be HATED from day one and everyone will rally against him, unifying us and guaranteeing him a ONE term presidency or perhaps shortening it further.  An impeachment would galvanize all of us and that\u2019s very good for expecting & demanding real choices for commander and chief in the next election.   We CAN get Trump out of office easily, we can\u2019t get Crooked Hillary out so easily. \nA vote for Trump creates the very real possibility of the creation and acceptance of a multiparty system in the next election.  With Hillary being elected you forfeit that opportunity for the foreseeable future. \n\nLater, when you\u2019re in the shower, after having been to the polls and you are frantically trying to wash out the stain you feel on your soul for having voted for Trump know that you made the only choice you could in a very bad situation.\n\nFor once in your lives stop thinking with emotions and think STRATEGY - Vote for that piece of shit Trump if you love your country and want to start the process of taking it back.

I truly don't understand what it is about the democratic party that appeals to a person simply because of the color of their skin or their gender.  I consider myself non-partisan.  I have some liberal values, some conservative, none of which have anything to do with the color of my skin.  I am not religious, but support a person's right to believe whatever they want.  I don't believe personally in abortion, but I support a person's right to have access to it.

I think they are both terrible human beings, regardless of the face they put on for the media.  What I don't understand is that once the primaries were over, or very nearly decided, why there was this big show of support from both the Republican and Democratic side who had adamantly opposed Clinton or Trump prior to the nomination, but now are endorsing them.  \"I'm a democrat...black...female...etc. so I am voting for Clinton.\"  This makes absolutely zero sense to any human being with any rational thought.  People say that they are just voting for the lesser of two evils.  Polls clearly demonstrate that a vast majority of Americans consider Hillary Clinton untrustworthy.  What is the lesser of two evils in this case?  Voting for a person who spent the majority of her life in a career in politics, supposedly to serve the American people, yet can't even garner a trust factor from at least half of the country?

He just released his tax plan, which from what I have seen in the same old republican format of tax breaks for the wealthy. He  has called for building a wall on the US-Mexican border, which would cost billions of dollars (that mexico will certainly not pay), and will be ineffective. He has called on banning Muslims from entering the United States, and putting American Muslims on some sort of register, not sure how that solves more problems than it creates by radicalizing more Muslims domestically and abroad. I have yet to hear him or really any other republican touch on the increasingly unaffordable higher education system in this country or our hugely deteriorating infrastructure. Maybe I have missed something there, but I don't think I have. Really the only way I see that Trump unites people is through fear. Just my two cents.

And you know full well the powers that be will assure she becomes a 2 termer.  That SAVES us 8 years of business as usual which we can\u2019t afford anymore.  A vote for Trump gives a chance that Bernie could mount a more effective campaign again sooner than with Hillary in office for 2 terms.  A vote for Trump puts a crack in the two party bullshit system and gives a very good chance that in a short time we could have a FAR better choice of candidates for change than the two ass-clowns they\u2019ve forced on us to choose from.  A vote for Trump creates an imbalance and when there is imbalance in the system instead of death-grip control there are OPPORTUNITIES.

I truly don't understand what it is about the democratic party that appeals to a person simply because of the color of their skin or their gender.  I consider myself non-partisan.  I have some liberal values, some conservative, none of which have anything to do with the color of my skin.  I am not religious, but support a person's right to believe whatever they want.  I don't believe personally in abortion, but I support a person's right to have access to it.  I think our drug policy is a joke, but I also believe that those who are breaking the very same drug laws I oppose are doing so at their own risk.  Don't want to get busted for smoking an illegal substance?  Don't fucking smoke it dumbass, it's illegal.  I am registered as non-partisan because I truly don't fit into either party.  I choose to vote for whomever I feel would have the most positive impact to our country as a leader.  As with many Americans during this election, I don't agree with either candidate.  I think they are both terrible human beings, regardless of the face they put on for the media.  What I don't understand is that once the primaries were over, or very nearly decided, why there was this big show of support from both the Republican and Democratic side who had adamantly opposed Clinton or Trump prior to the nomination, but now are endorsing them.  \"I'm a democrat...black...female...etc. so I am voting for Clinton.\"  This makes absolutely zero sense to any human being with any rational thought.  People say that they are just voting for the lesser of two evils.  Polls clearly demonstrate that a vast majority of Americans consider Hillary Clinton untrustworthy.  What is the lesser of two evils in this case?  Voting for a person who spent the majority of her life in a career in politics, supposedly to serve the American people, yet can't even garner a trust factor from at least half of the country?  Or is it voting for a person who may be a loudmouth sensational jackass, but has always been that way, and has been that way as a private citizen, not responsible for the welfare of an entire population.

He  has called for building a wall on the US-Mexican border, which would cost billions of dollars (that mexico will certainly not pay), and will be ineffective. He has called on banning Muslims from entering the United States, and putting American Muslims on some sort of register, not sure how that solves more problems than it creates by radicalizing more Muslims domestically and abroad.

As for illegal immigration, I have a problem with the American penchant for believing in the \"law\" as something sacred and bearing an equal weight along the totality of the moral spectrum.

Thus, the  xenophobic paranoia of ill-educated whites, with little cultural exposure beyond their narrow horizons, are stoked by the fear driven narrative of wealthy, white nationalists. Mexicans (and Muslims) being the demons and de jour for isolationists and white supremacists. Someone crossing an arbitrary border with a desire to succeed and find a better life is simply being very human.  Undocumented workers pay taxes, work damn hard, and are a net benefit to our nation.\nNow, let's look at the historical pattern of this ugly xenophobia.  The Irish and their papism, breeding like rats: those shifty, money-grubbing, Christ-killing Eastern European Jews; those horrible Italians and their mafioso crimes. Then we have the Chinese, who built the western railroads but, when they had the audacity to take to the mining claims or open businesses, fell prey to bigotry and the Exclusion Act. Not to mention the Japanese Americans who became the most decorated American soldiers of ww2, all after their wealth was seized and their families shipped off to camps.

That is, in agricultural slave societies the State was put into play to protect the ownership rights of the masters over land and slave. In medieval times, those of the feudal contract, the State existed to to legitimize the role and rule of the nobility over the peasants and serfs. In modern times, the owners of the productive means of society are no longer the Masters nor the Nobility. The owners of the productive means are now Capitalists, and as an extension the State apparatus now exists to legitimize and protect the rights of capitalists vs. the rights of their workers. The concept of economics and politics being separate (and thus capitalism being separate from government) is a relatively new one and stems from a separation of what was once called Political Economy into Political Science and Economics. \n\nThe economics of a given society affect and effect the way the politics in that society are operated. Owners of the productive means of society always have greater wealth and are thus more useful to politicians, but, more importantly, any given politician must take into account \"business confidence\" in their decisions. If a given area loses \"business confidence\", businesses will begin leaving. Thus, while the state may or may not be corrupted, it is always necessary for it to bend its knee to collective capitalist wills in the interest of keeping its economy afloat. As such, the existence of the State is to ensure the continued presence of the capitalist class... even if that means setting this law or that against them to weaken public anger against them. All history is, it has been said, a result of class struggle between the ruling classes and the ruled classes.\n\nAny government in a capitalist society is by definition a bourgeois/capitalist government because without pandering to capitalists the economy will fail. It's the precise reason why the \"money in politics\" argument is a joke: it doesn't actually change relations that take the power from those who have it. It only makes it seem that way. It's the same argument Engels made against universal suffrage: that it doesn't matter how many people can vote so long as politicians must pander to business interests.\n\nCapitalism is a mode of production.

And if so, eventually you must be willing to take the lives of others if they are not mutual or if you are non-mutual. Once those willing to kill for a concept of justice, a state would start to take form. A state could be defending the concept of property.\n\nThe state, which could include the capitalistic reforms under its law, twist peoples minds out of the definition of justice and concept of 'right'. Justice can be whatever the moral of the population holds, which has before been learned and most likely twisted.\n\nAnyway, I doubt you don't twist your own mind with the goal to avoid dangers, feel better or apply for something with greater ambition, others I've already seen you do \"(...) are you such a terrible person (...)\", and the fact that we even discuss this indicate our willingness to change our own and others minds. The state does it to others far more than its own, and many times its some individual being trying to get ahead of others making the change. But I kind of agree with it sometimes. Not in the regulations through punishing, threat, shaming or lack of sympathy, but like advocating not to take heroine or not to pollute. A state should manipulate to an extent in its aim for greater well-being of all, but it should also be informed to its peoples knowing and should be able to be changed if needed. The purpose in moral change should be clearly defined. Just so you know, a capitalist could sell heroine and then denies responsibility of its effects and call it 'free will' or responsibility of its victim. It's often a sort of accepted scamming with manipulation as a part of its game. The only thing that really makes capitalism work is a well developed moral of the society using it, resulting in something like giving a tip and seeing the riches in helping one's society.\n\nThe disconnect between the self and its actions is not the state itself, its a religious part of the state which we often come in contact with. We still have a state that believes in 'free will', something it has not defined, and authority uses a compatibilistic concept of this. A mind twister. You 'should/could/would have...'(indeterminism, 'free will', condemnation) but they 'did their job/did according to the law/<causal actions>'(determinism, not 'free will', sympathy). It's old stuff in the base of the law that formed in religious times where apostles referred to a soul in their condemnation of 'evil', daemons or gods infliction when they did not understand the cause of someones actions or the circumstance. It's something to point at when the state lack in recognizing its failure. \n\nI believe that if a state would be fully deterministic, the knowledge of responsibility, one's impact, would be greater in the individual and state law development. People would be more sympathetic. With this though, capitalism would be regulated and distribution of resources would be formed to strive for equality, or at least maximizing the access to them for the many.

If Bernie really wanted to debate he would have put up more money, or pushed for a stronger deal in which a charity would have gotten more money. Also if you support Bernie you should actually thank Trump for even making it a matter of discussion. It put an even bigger spotlight on how (I think we can both agree) Crooked Hillary is for backing out of the California debate after making Bernie do a New Hampshire debate (of which she still lost). Bernie could win California, and Trump has had a helping hand regardless of a debate or not. Bernie is a better debater than Hilary, I think, because he actually cares in what he is saying.

Conspiracy thoerists and propagandists keep claiming there is state secrecy because they don't hear what they want to hear or they cannot prove their allegations so resort to claiming the government is hiding the so called 'truth' \n\nFor Bush to be behind 9/11 would require a conspiracy so vast and elaborate it would require hundreds of thousands of co-conspirators and they would have to remain silent to this day. Since the US government cannot even keep a blowjob in the oval office a secret I doubt they could keep this elaborate mass murder secret! no co-conspirators have come forward why? because there was no conspiracy. \n\nOsama Binladen turns in watery grave everytime someone thinks his sworn enemy done the very attack he carried out.\n \"I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers\" -Osama Binladen \n\n\"America has been hit by Allah at its most vulnerable point, destroying, thank God, its most prestigious buildings.\" -Osama Binladen", "id": "czht9he"}, {"comment": ">WTC7 Burned for 7 hours leave a building burning for long enough it will come crashing down. \n\nActually only three steel buildings have ever come crashing do to \"burning long enough\" they were all on 9/11.

Instead the materials were moved immediately.  And  \"Dozens of pieces of steel\" in a propaganda display does not mean storing or analyzing evidence.\n\n2nd No physical evidence has led us to Osama.  I also would say thank god that these buildings were hit that is not linking me physically to the crime.  We all know that even people who ADMIT murders have to have evidence before they can go to jail.  There are plenty of false admissions especially in the terrorism world.  No physical evidence has lead us to Osama.  Hooray you found some of their holdings IN THE 90s in swiss... Great.  Did you also find that the Carlyle group worked closely with the Bush and Bin Laden families then.  Did you also find the Bush families hidings in the same era?  Having a swiss account in the 90s does not link him to 9/11 .\n\nThe next money like you linked me even shows OVER and OVER possible FOREKNOWLEDGE of 9/11 by US investigators.  So not sure if you are trying to link to me evidence for conspiracy or proof of no conspiracy.  It also says that the increase in US dollar action was their tip off.  Then goes further into saying that Bin Laden had lots of money.\n\nAlso goes to the point that Bin Laden was NOT a mastermind or a leader, he just hired lots of bodyguards.  The US was fooled by video of him with armed men that HE PAID INDIVIDUALLY and hired exactly the same way our CIA and their hired assassin bodyguards go around the world they were not on some holy war for him.  Just in need of a job.\n\nThen you send me a link saying that most of his money is funneled through DUN DUN DUN DUN our \"allies\".  Our \"Close Allies\" in the war on terror Saudi Arabia... where most the hijackers were also from.   And if you aren't with us you are against us WHY DIDN'T WE THEN ATTACK SAUDI ARABIA?  Because they were in on it.  Partners.\n\nAgain.  You are trying to assume that debres could take down the building at FREE FALL SPEED.  That means NO structural resistance from BELOW.  Debris if I understand correctly, land on top of a structure... they don't sever the supports below.  Resistance is still taking place in your theory.  Not supported by video evidence.  And yes you show me HUGE holes MUCH BIGGER THAN number 7 holes in buildings that low and behold... stay standing up.\n\nBurning on one or two floors for 7 hours still does not account for the vanishing resistance of ALL OTHER FLOORS as it fell.  \n\nFinally you link me NIST which we know can't be trusted.\n\nNO it would not take something SO vast for Bush to be behind it.  It is actually quite simple to pull off considering that Americans are so brain washed into thinking black and white we are good evil exists only outside our borders corruption doesn't happen here.  It is something that most people would never even entertain the idea of and very easy to pull off.  \n\nI'm a stage hypnotist by trade.

No! individuals can open bank accounts in any country they like the governments cannot possibly know the intentions of every individual with a bank account in the private sector. \n\n>WHY DIDN'T WE THEN ATTACK SAUDI ARABIA?\n\nBecause al Qaeda was based in Afghanistan.

In order to try Bin Laden WITHOUT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE linking him to the crime (which there was none) they needed testimony that he was the leader of an organization.  Without which organized crime laws could not be used in the court to try him in Abeyance.  \n\nThe FBI paid $100,000 to an informant to testify to the fact there was a criminal organization and they named it and gave it a leader name.

So I don't see myself convincing you of anything beyond this point. ", "id": "czi4swv"}, {"comment": "It isn't conspiracy that is religious mentality.  I don't trust the authorities that give you your \"evidence\".  There was plenty of evidence by scientists in the Darwinian romanced German of the 1940s.  Leaders who wanted to paint the story in the media about the enemy did so.  They had testimony, evidence, trails, lots of things against the Jews.  Scientists said they represent poor genetic information (we were on a gene kick) economists said there were ties to them and theft, or corruption, or just the dregs of society dragging us- repeated narratives with little ACTUAL evidence.  But became the normal psyche of the people to think it was true and shame anyone who felt otherwise.  \n\nControlling people is easy.  Pavlovs dogs.  \n\nThe fact is what they show you is not the whole truth and there is no transparency in their investigation.  you simple believe it as true because A) you trust the authority B) Its repeated enough by the population.  That is Propaganda, it propogates easily because people are already emotionally connected to the idea.  Contrary evidence is harder to accept because you already subscribe to one authority story.  That creates confirmation bias.  That is really simple science to create the narrative they wanted.  And why wouldn't it work it's worked so many times in the past.  The best part of how it works is how much people simply trust the story they are told because they believe so much it couldn't happen here.  Especially if they got to vote for him or pretend to.  The conscious mind would never admit to being duped into electing actual pure evil.  That level of corruption could only exist in writing or in a foreign land.  \n\nOnly the Muslims can be extremists in their ideology and not your president and cabinet.  They were all influenced together in the same era by the same minds.  Neo Conservative theory.  Bushes, Ashcroft, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Cheney on and on the names of all the people in power were political ZEALOTS with power and wealth.  As crazy as the pictures we paint of Iranian or N. Korean leadership through the years.  Our leaders were following an ideology put forth by Carl Schmidt and other minds of the time.\n\nThey all knew they needed to galvanize the numbers by having a huge emotional external or internal real or perceived THREAT.  Neo-Cons bent lots of rules, changed the games in the extreme profiteering of the collusion between public and private enforcement bodies.\n\nOrganized crime has many different looks.  But sure as satan if you look deep enough into all the Neo-Cons and their private gatherings, fraternaties, colluding- it amounts to the silentest of coups.  Power seized in the Patriot act and silencing of journalists who publish leaks they seek to keep the story told their way.  \n\nSeriously I get you believe this authority.  We all were made to stand every day with a hand over hearts pledging over and over.  Repeatedly.  Its hard for you to question their official narrative.  Remember pancake theory is still JUST A THEORY because we have NO OTHER EVIDENCE, NO CONTROLS, NO TRIALS... they just tell you it can happen we didn't know until this very day but now that it happened 3 times in one day we're sure that is what happened.\n\nThat isn't evidence to me anyway... that is blind trust in an official narrative.\n\nIn my stage hypnosis shows.  I gain consent of peoples mind first by asking simple suggestions like stand and place your hand here or there.  Gaining authority so that in the moment I say sleep their mind is in an unquestioning response.  Building up over the next 30 minutes suggestions get harder to follow but the conditioning makes their mind ready to simply accept what I say as true in that state of mind.  And I usually end the show asking which of my guests hate lemons.  I present them with fresh lemons and tell them they are oranges.  They also fight tooth and nail showing me all the proof that what they are eating is the sweetest juiciest orange.  They KNOW IT.  The evidence is right there... until I snap my fingers and say wide awake and they throw it to the ground in disgust.\n\nHuman minds all work that same way.  You are influenced in a way in which you believe you are seeing evidence.  I don't give authority to Bush's cabinet and friends to give me testimony as I said I question the whole body of investigators on the comittee and I question how much of the meeting was \"for our safety\" omitted.\n\nI question why they would omit all the safety specs of the building that allow their model to take place.

Oh was that trump?\n\n Completely ignoring information because of a source is willful ignorace. I even turn on fox news here and there to try things from a different angle. You shouldn't limit yourself or your reasoning so much.\n\n>First he trashes Trump for having lots of money, as if Frei doesn't make well into six figures. Then he turns around and trashes his for not having as much as he says. So is Trump's capitalism too much and evil? Or  does he not have enough?\n\nAs a journalist, you have to take a third party stance. The wealth of the reporter is irrelevant to the argument. So he says he doesn't have as much as he says, forgive the horrible sentence.  Pointing this out is drawing attention to his inflation of character, or his branding, which is shown to be almost entirely a ruse as well as enlightening about his narcissism. He is not rich because of smart business, he is rich because he was given everything. His dad was in real estate before him, and he rode his dads coattails through the housing bubble. then when it popped he pushed his debt onto the lenders. That's not good business, that's taking advantage of people, and exactly what the big banks did in 2008.\n\n Is his capitalism too much and evil or not enough? This is classic black and white thinking. You cannot put him in a box as either good or bad capitalist. It's an economic system, it doesn't have morality. The person who uses the system to his advantage, however, is morally responsible for the boon or harm he creates. Trump seems to leave plenty of harm in his wake, ie, the golf course and bankrupt businesses.\n\n>Trump destroys him when him and Frei  talk face to face, then whimpers and pouts to the camera because he was \"insulted\" by the man who's reputation he's trying his darndest to smear.\n\nI assume your talking about this video\nhttps://youtu.be/MWAvJepn40o\n\nI don't see what your talking about. Trump really came off weak in that interview, and all he could say was \"you don't understand economics\". He gives no details about the issue. I'm not convinced he knows anything about it. If anything, Frei destroyed trump.\n\n>Even tries to harp on the alleged \"rape\" comment made by Trumps ex-wife, which she very clearly took back. But he tries his best to blow it up when grasping at straws.\n\nI don't think it is grasping at straws at all. It is very indicative of his character and in line with everything we know about him. He doesn't like being told no. He can't handle it. she said that stuff under oath. Yeah she said she didnt want it interpreted criminally, but that could be part of the divorce process. part of that deal was that she cannot talk about their marriage once divorced. Unless you think you can't rape your wife, which is wrong on so many levels, then trump is by definition a rapist. The video he says putin would just give Snowden back of he asked. There's no way that would happen. Putin is more stubborn than trump. What would trump do in response to being told no by an even larger than life figure than himself? Increase tensions by imposing trade restrictions? That the last thing we want to do. Think this shit through.\n\n>This faux doc is pure tripe and bullshit. Frei can't believe that a rich and doesn't subscribe to the same high society that he does. Trump is unapologetic and speaks his mind?? ***GASP***\n\nOkay so all of it is false? Or none of it, and it's all taken out of context. At what point can you admit that some of this is factual and points to some sort of fault in his character? Whether it be narcissism or divisive personalty, no concern for those that he causes suffering, or his pathological lying, there is something about him that makes him less than admirable. How can you stand behind that?\n\nReally pick any topic brought up in this doc and that makes him unfit for the Oval Office. Makes me want to puke that I thought a trump presidency might not be that bad only a few days ago.\n\n>If this is a documentary and not propoganda, I'm the pope.\n\nAnything that is produced pursuasivly is propaganda, got it. Every expose about culture is propaganda. Every environmental documentary is propaganda because it persuades people towards saving the environment. Education is propagana. Only the bible is real. At some point you have to accept some things that you dont like as truths, but I'll keep this in mind next time I read a pro trump article, if I ever see one.

You start with;\n\n> Is it better or worse\n\nbut then don't offer any comparison and just say they both took part in bribes.\n\nSo I'll give you the comparison. Let's say, Trump has bribed in business, **IN BUSINESS**. Should I clarify to you how significant the difference is between a possible bribe between commercial, civilian entities and that to another political entity or even foreign government? It's magnitudes of significance. A shady business dealing might effect some stock holders, depending on the gravity it could indeed effect a community or group of workers. Political corruption and ineptitude kills people, it effects millions of lives, not just if they have a job or not but if they have to flee their nation, if their home is destroyed, if their children die because they can't feed them. Do you know what's going on in Venezuela since her time in SoS? Honduras? There's plenty of evidence to support her actions led to the rise of ISIS and melt down happening in Syria, following her actions against Assad. Guess what, they started while she was Secretary of State, the leading arm of international relations in the World.\n\nFailed businesses? You obviously have no clue what you are talking about here either. I'm no expert but I know businesses fail all the time. You win some you lose some. Not every business we see on TV or buy products from was the very first business venture it's founders ever started. Often entrepreneur fail many businesses before becoming successful then still have failures thereafter. \n\nLet's compare Hillary's failures in her professional career.\n[let's review](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/435n7f/on_marijuana_hillary_clinton_sides_with_big/czfp01f/)\n\nWhat this list doesn't include is a ton of crap but more importantly her support, as SoS of the coups in South America and the middle East which has destroyed their economies and left **millions** of people devastated.\n\nTrump failed some business ventures and had some disputes which his associates or contractors. Hillary has literally destroyed countries with failed policies and inaction. Comparing the two is an absolute joke.\n\n> We don't hate Trump\n\n\"You\" don't hate Trump, plenty do, you don't speak for Hillary supporters as a group. I don't know if I hate Hillary, I don't know her as a person. I hate everything about her candidacy as president however. She used the DNC to manipulate her primary candidacy.

In 4 years as SoS, she sure had a LOT of influence on the rest of the world, all this toppling governments and other stuff, wow, that's kind of impressive, don't you think?  Why wouldn't you want someone that all powerful as President, compared to little hands Trump?\n\nI know I'm being silly but all this crap about Hillary is just that, silly.  \n\nI'm lumping you in with the rest of the Trump rednecks because that is how you act, you blow off anything Trump did as just BUSINESS and give Hillary god like powers to influence the entire world.\n\nOne final point.

On the other hand, they simply dismiss Trump's many failing as \"just business\" while ignoring the stupid, hateful, vile things he says and does on almost a daily basis.

For me, the political corruption, even if we haven't proven it yet, is too glaringly obvious to ignore and again for me is the capital offense for a politician. She should be held at a higher standard as an elected official. Trump is just getting into the game, his track record is as a civilian, it is different. American is trying to convict before he's even become a politician. His opponent however has been a politician for three decades and is completely shit at it.\n\nI guess what I really want when I post about Hillary vs. Trump is some kind of acceptance from people voting for Hillary that they are aware of what they are getting and just not ignoring it.\n\nLet's have some mutual respect for each and not make assumptions and stereotype each other. I'm not ignoring Trump's idiotic statements, I simply can't reconcile voting for a person who's conspired with the DNC against a competing candidate, who vilified her husbands lovers publicly, who's accepted millions from banks and business's for 'speeches', who co-founded a 'charity' that is almost certainly a front for political bribery, the list goes on. All these actions as an elected or representative official of the United States. Maybe that's just not significant for people or it's a 'right-wing' conspiracy. That 'charity' has accepted money from foreign nations who have received benefits from the United States while she was SoS among a ton of other shady 'coincidences'. There wasn't a thousand other charities already doing the same work, they just felt they needed to create a charity to do what exactly? The last figure I read said less than 10% of their funds go to actual charitable activity. Guess who the real benefactors are? The people they've hired to run that shitshow, the political entities that donate to it and 'coincidentally' receive some kind cleverly disguised kickback. This isn't a new thing, it's 1000's of years old and happens all over the world. The Clinton's are just a little bit better at making the American people believe it's okay.\n\nTrump again, probably no better and may fail a president but I can't vote for someone who has cheated the American people and has been groomed by the scum in the Democratic party. Trump at least is at odds with both parties and that I can stand by and support. Both parties are full of people looking to keep the gravy train flowing and Trump of the two is the only one possibly to go against the status quo and disrupt the engine.\n\nAdditionally I don't want 4 or 8 more years of Obama.

Compare that to just about any other big charity and you'll see how unique that is.  As for Hillary giving away benefits to people who donate, there simply is no evidence of that and if there was even a shred, don't you think all the Hillary haters on the right would be doing the same thing they did with Benghazi?

Even groups of similar people can't get along (Shia vs Sunni, Protestants vs Catholics, England vs France, Serbs vs Croats, hutu vs tutsi, Muslim vs Hindu, Han Chinese vs Uiyghur) All that diversity ever achieves is conflict. Thats all. There is no way to \"solve\" racism. Only coercive force of govt could possibly do that, by being extremely heavy handed. Example: no shia -sunni conflict in Saddaams Baathist Iraq, however after he falls, it's a bloodbath of shia vs sunni. The same effect could be achieved in western countries (suppression of ethnic cultural rivalries) with an extremely repressive govt.

Preferring your in-group (race) is adaptive. The reason there are similar groups and peoples that all look the same is because this is a normal natural human thing that cannot be suppressed.  \n  \n**How to solve it?** Simple: segregation. Keep people that hate each other away from each other. Keep in-groups together and out-groups apart. That's it. By forcing everyone to mix together you create friction between these groups that didn't need to be together and didn't have friction. It's *very* un-PC to say this, and many people would view it as morally wrong. But what is wrong about solving conflict? The more differences people have, the more they have to fight about. It's that simple. However we are constantly bombarded with the orwellian message \"Diversity is our strength\", when from what we can see in the news that is not the case.  \n  \nIf diversity was really our strength, why would an organization like Black Lives Matter exist? If all black people lived together in a political area where all the police and authorities were black, would there be a need for an organization like \"Black lives matter\"?

That is childish fantasy of \"good guys and bad guys\". \n\nThe fact that you and that other user think we did, or used to, is naive. It's rose-colored glasses. We didn't fight Hitler because he was gassing Jews or holding a boot over the German people. We did it because he suddenly became a threat to our allies and perhaps ourselves. \n\nDon't believe me? Explain why we let the Armenian genocide happen. Explain why we let Stalin kill millions. Or Mao? Explain why we basically just *don't give half a shit* about sub-saharan African warlords? Or why we even go so far as to *fund them* by overblown sanctimonious concerts like Geldof's Live Aid? \n\n*We don't* ***really*** *care*. \n\nThroughout modern history leaders have told their people one thing about why we should go to war while honestly reasoning another way. Didn't used to have to though, papal seats and monarchies didn't have to answer to The People. But as people became more free, power had to come up with ways to convince the people they were still free, and more, that they were *good and right and proper*. Enter Propaganda.\n\nIronically the only ones who seem honest in hindsight are those who had the worst motives: Conquest. When Rome sought out new lands, it wasn't to 'free the Gauls'. It wasn't to bring Roman freedom to the barbarians. It was to expand Roman influence and power, and oh, gather a bunch of slaves while we're at it. \n\nIt's the same today. We went to Afghanistan and Iraq, ostensibly in retaliation for 9/11. In reality we built permanent military bases all along an oil pipeline from the Caspian to the Arabian sea. We didn't do anything else. We didn't attempt to secure the rest of the country *except* around those bases. We went in for oil. Oh, and heroin.\n\nHeroin use doubled in the last decade in America. *Doubled in a decade*. It was dropping significantly before that, but suddenly it's back. That's not a small increase. And where is the world's supply of heroin? *Afghanistan of course!* 92% of the non-pharma opium in the world is produced in Afghanistan. And that production has been *rising since the US got there*. \n\nIsn't that *exactly what happened* in Vietnam? Bunch of soldiers leave, bunch of addicts return, along with new avenues of drug trafficking? \n\nNow combine that with the known fact that the CIA has been caught *multiple times* smuggling drugs from other third-world countries into the USA and what are we really seeing here? Just another venue for consolidating money and power. Look at the timeline. Anno 2000 hits, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar *along with the UN* declare that opium is un-Islamic and begins eradicating it. Imagine that! The Taliban and the UN working together! [In 2001 Afghanistan has the lowest Opium yield *ever*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Afghanistan_opium_poppy_cultivation_1994-2007b.PNG). Then what happens? Oh, America suddenly found a reason to go after the Taliban. *Why*? Because the Drug war is more profitable to our country than oil, and we can't have a drug war without drugs. We *need the drugs* to keep the war going. That's the great paradox, that's the great irony. \n\nAnd yet people still believe we go to war to stop some great 'evil'. No, son, stand back and take a look at history and you'll see we *are* the great evil in this world.

Total control ", "id": "d3yz9qg"}, {"comment": "You'll have to make more specific distinctions if we want to go any further", "id": "d3z5qah"}, {"comment": "The main distinction is this: Totalitarianism is defined by the idea that politics is *totalizing*, meaning every facet of life is politicized and the government has authority over all of it. The Nazis' vision of a master race (and policies that required German citizens to further that vision) would be the classic example. But there are others too: Stalin's brutal crushing of dissent, Mao's cultural revolution, Pol Pot's year zero, etc. It's essentially the idea that the state has the power to define the totality of the individual's life, they have absolute authority over every aspect of society. The state also has the power to govern accordingly. \n\nAuthoritarianism is different. Generally, an authoritarian regime lacks the ideological purism that defines totalitarianism, but they still believe in absolute authority. The government can still be anti-democratic, repressive, hawkish, etc., but the scope is generally smaller. Much of that is because they also tend to be weaker governments that are more corrupt. In the 20th century, authoritarianism was most common in poor countries. Examples of authoritarian regimes would be Pinochet's Chile, Putin's Russia, Mobutu's Democratic Republic of the Congo or Idi Amin's Uganda. \n\nThere are a couple of things to note about that though. It's a myth that totalitarian regimes are left-wing and authoritarian ones are right wing. I read comments that say that a lot, but it's really not true. There've been right-wing totalitarian regimes and left-wing authoritarian ones.  Very often, left-wing totalitarian states become authoritarian regimes as they get weaker or lose their revolutionary zeal. \n\nIt's also worth noting that \"authoritarianism\" can mean different things to different political scientists. I'm giving a comparative politics definition of authoritarianism here, that defines authoritarianism as a style of government; but the documentary isn't talking about that per se. They're not suggesting that Trump will have death squads, labor camps, etc. Instead, they're talking about \"authoritarianism\" as a disposition that voters have. And it's pretty much as they define it in the video: Support for a strong government that imposes order (even at the expense of rule of law, civil liberties, transparency, etc.).

STEWART: I think the -- the Constitution would have permitted Congress to apply the electioneering communication restrictions to the extent that they were otherwise constitutional under Wisconsin Right to Life. Those could have been applied to additional media as well. And it's worth remembering that the preexisting Federal Election Campaign Act restrictions on corporate electioneering which have been limited by this Court's decisions to express advocacy. \n>\n>JUSTICE ALITO: That's pretty incredible. You think that if -- if a book was published, a campaign biography that was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, that could be banned? \n>\n>MR. STEWART: I'm not saying it could be banned. I'm saying that Congress could prohibit the use of corporate treasury funds and could require a corporation to publish it using its -- \n>\n>JUSTICE ALITO: Well, most publishers are corporations. And a publisher that is a corporation could be prohibited from selling a book? \n>\n>MR. STEWART: Well, of course the statute contains its own media exemption or media -- \n>\n>JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not asking what the statute says. The government's position is that the First Amendment allows the banning of a book if it's published by a corporation? \n>\n>MR.

That question is obviously not presented here. But the other two things -- \n>\n>JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it were an advocacy organization that had a book.

There would have been more than ample opportunity for separate litigation to address that issue before the situation ever reached that extreme scenario.

The fact is leftists are quick to violence and anger and conservatives are just not as much. Being a leftist stems from an inherent insecurity with ones self for being weak and non-normative. Hence the desire for a larger government to take care of them because they are insecure about being outsiders and weak. This causes the behavior presented in the video. When someone threatens their sense of security they lash out. Conservatives are much more secure and confident in themselves and their ability, hence the desire for limited government. \n\nThere are plenty of psychological studies and brain scan studies that basically confirm this. Leftists and conservatives have different brains. Specifically the amygdala. The part of the brain that processes fear and threats. The leftists have smaller, more deficient amygdalas which cause them to act irrationally when confronted with threats. Think \"not all muslims are like that.\" when any sane person knows all it takes is one. Any rational person would look at the number of muslims there are, their patterns of behavior and conclude that the risk of allowing them into your civilization is not worth the reward. But the leftist doesnt act rationally to threats. The leftist (better called the egalitarian) unconsciously knows they are weak. The beta wolfs of the pack. If the pack starts to discriminate against outsiders who present threats to the packs well being, its only a matter of time before the pack starts to focus on the insider betas that are dragging the pack down with their weakness. This is why the egalitarian feels inherently threatened by any strength displayed by the alphas. This is why leftists are so visibly terrified of Donald Trump and really any conservative in general but especially Trump. They know their power over society is in jeopardy and with that, their social acceptance. And there is *nothing* that causes a leftist more panic than losing social acceptance. Because they are weak and insecure they know that if they lose social acceptance its only a matter of time before the strong, the makers tire of the weak takers. \n\nAlso i want to point out that the NYT video was footage from *inside* the Donald Trump rallies. Any leftist there is deliberately there to agitate and instigate. They are private affairs that are supposed to be for supporters only. A \"safe space\" if you will. People are entitled to be able to socialize and rally with their in-group if they so choose. The blatant hostility we see in OP's video is outside. It is not a pro Hillary rally. It is not a safe space. It is the public space. There is a world of difference between the videos, the people, and the actions presented.

Miles Corak exem- plifies this for the difference observed in the United States for families with children under the age of 18.15 The top fifth of such families have about 12 times as much income as the bottom fifth. If the intergenerational persistence of income was equal to one, that income advantage would be transferred in whole to the next generation. That is, the children of the richest fifth would have 12 times as much income as the children of the poorest fifth. If the intergenerational persis- tence of income were equal to zero, none of that advantage would be present among the children of these groups. Corak reported that U.S. estimates of the elasticity vary in the range of 0.4\u20130.6, corresponding to an inherited income advantage of between 2.70 and 4.44 for the richest fifth compared to the poorest fifth. Elasticity at these levels means that the children whose parents were among the richest fifth (i.e., parents whose income was 12 times that of the poorest fifth) grow up to earn about 3 to 4 times as much as the children whose parents were among the poorest fifth. Thus, their income advantage was roughly half that of their parents.\nhttp://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc262g.pdf\n\n\nIncome correlated to parents\nhttp://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2010/02/mobility1.jpg\n\n\nhttp://www.businessnewsdaily.com/3088-american-dream-wealthy-parents.html\n\nDegree worth less if you're poor\nhttp://www.brookings.edu/blogs/social-mobility-memos/posts/2016/02/19-college-degree-worth-less-raised-poor-hershbein\n\n", "id": "d6h5cda"}, {"comment": "Again, nothing you posted refutes the fact that 80% of 1%ers are first generation.

An additional 20 percent of the wage gap was attributed to differences in occupational distributions between blacks and whites. **Thus, 25 percent of the wage gap was unaccounted for by their model.[11]**\n\nSo if you account for things like education, region, marital status, occupational distributions, and you still have a significant portion of the wage gap unexplained, what's the likely scenario?\n\n* [Minorities overwhelmingly targeted by cops in NYC stop and frisk, but overwhelmingly innocent](http://www.nyclu.org/content/stop-and-frisk-data)\n\n>An analysis by the NYCLU revealed that innocent New Yorkers have been subjected to police stops and street interrogations more than 5 million times since 2002, and that black and Latino communities continue to be the overwhelming target of these tactics. **Nearly nine out of 10 stopped-and-frisked New Yorkers have been completely innocent according to the NYPD\u2019s own reports:**\n\nSo blacks and minorities make up about 85%+ of those stopped and frisked, but 90% of those stopped and frisked are so innocent of any wrong-doing that they don't even get issued a ticket or a citation. No wonder so many minorities go to prison. They're the only ones being shaken down by cops.

Majority black and Hispanic neighborhoods with median incomes of $40,000 to $50,000 had far higher rates, including East Flatbush, where 44 percent of the loans were from subprime companies, and Queens Village (34.6 percent).\n\nLet's summarize shall we?\n\n1.

A white felon has just a good a chance, or better, of getting a job.\n2. Even when hired, blacks are going to get paid less for the same job. Yippee!!!\n3. Minorities and blacks in particular are way more likely to be stopped by police, even when police statistics show they are overwhelmingly innocent.\n4. Minorities are less likely to abuse drugs/carry guns than white people but significantly more likely to get arrested for it. Sweeeet!\n5. If you're black, prepare for a longer prison sentence than a white guy who committed the same crime. Even if you have a similar criminal history.\n6. You're more likely to be wrongly convicted if you're black. Yay!\n7. #5 is explained by the fact that white people tend to support harsher penalties for black people than white people. \n8. White people apparently don't like seeing minorities on TV and movie screens. Seems pretty racist to me. Why should it matter what color the actors are? \n9.

He tried to use the Moore trick of trying to arrange an interview with Moore - and being rebuffed.  A cheap trick, to be sure.\n\nBut along the way, the director interviewed a lot of people who make documentaries, including the Maysles brothers (Grey Gardens) who explained to him that this sort of modern \"Documentary\" (such as \"Supersize me\" or all of the Moore movies) where the director goes in front of the camera and becomes the star, is really not a documentary at all.\n\nThe film starts to change focus at that point, as to what is a documentary anyway, and the director, humbled, realizes that his goal of \"getting\" Michael Moore was pretty stupid.\n\nIf it is still on Netflix, it is pretty interesting.  Less about Moore than documentaries and how they really should be done, not how the likes of Moore and Spurlock do them.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nThe film and its poster are patterned after Moore's film Roger & Me, during which Moore attempts to chase down Roger Bonham Smith for an interview. In this case, Wilson seeks an interview with Moore. Wilson also adopts other aspects of Moore's style in his efforts at satirizing Moore. For instance, Wilson interviews a mix of Americans across the country and well-known figures like conservatives Dinesh D'Souza, David Horowitz and Andrew Breitbart, liberal Albert Maysles and fellow libertarians such as Penn Jillette and Tim Slagle. Wilson revisits some of Moore's shooting locations and subjects from Roger & Me and Bowling for Columbine, and attempts to discredit many aspects of Moore's films.[2]\n\nWilson's main criticism is that Moore misrepresents the truth by staging events and deftly cutting sequences to distort the truth. As an example of Moore staging events, Michael Wilson offers the scene in Bowling for Columbine where Michael Moore gets a gun on opening a bank account. An interview with the bank employees suggests that Michael Moore had arranged for the gun to be delivered to the bank ahead of time so he could walk outside with it immediately after opening the bank account. To show Moore uses deceptive editing, Michael Wilson offers the scenes in Bowling for Columbine of NRA president Charlton Heston speaking. The scenes are cut together from different speeches; however, in the film they may be construed to be from one speech given shortly after the Columbine shooting at a meeting in Denver.[4]", "id": "cy3pvfj"}, {"comment": "Moore isn't a documentarian, he's a polemicist.", "id": "cy48io7"}], [{"comment": "You know how some people are \"gone but not forgotten\"?

Palestine was, first, a historic area along the Mediterranean Sea, encompassing most of where Gaza is today. Palestine was only a country by the mandate of the British, which encompassed all of what is now Jordan, Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank. When the UN established three states they let Jordan take 85% of it, and soon split the rest nearly equally between the Jews and Muslims (no mention of the Christians, of course, but they were mostly culturally aligned with the Muslims, also Arabs, but politically aligned with the Jews, because the Jews treated them better.\n\nWhen Israel declared itself, it was attacked on all sides by it's neighbors and in the war to defend itself, it quickly gained a lot of ground. Many Palestinians left at the behest of the surrounding Arab countries in order not to be caught in the ensuing war and were told (by Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt) that they would return to a Jew-free land. They were wrong so most of those who left were SOL.\n\nA few Palestinians left because they didn't feel safe staying, though thousands, now millions, stayed and now live peacefully as Israeli citizens so you can't really fault people for leaving a war zone but those who stayed are doing much better than their neighbors (in every country) and it's not like the war lasted that long.\n\nSo, there's no way to justify the statement \"Israel claims its enemies want to wipe it off the map, but it has indeed wiped a whole country called Palestine off the map!\" because historical Palestine is now Gaza (and under Hamas' control), the UN's Palestine is still the same 85% it always was, now simply called Jordan, and the rest, which was called Palestine for less than 30 years is now called Israel but has a larger Muslim and Christian population that it ever did before.

I'm talking about his call for \"revolution\" and his implicit promise that all you have to do is unstack the stacked deck and suddenly everything will fall into place.  Anybody who wants to be a responsible politician on the national stage should acknowledge the spectrum of opinion among the American people.  When a politician tells his supporters that their policy frustrations have nothing to do with other citizens disagreeing with them, that it's all about a stacked deck and an elite conspiracy that can be undone if they send an honest man to Washington, then he's misleading them and setting them up for disappointment.

Do we really want that on the left, or do we want to keep focusing on winning policy battles one by one?  Democracy has made big sweeping revolutions obsolete and replaced them with thousands of tiny revolutions every year at every level of government.  The biggest revolutions we see are one party taking control of Congress, or the first black guy getting elected president, or Obamacare.

If we fall for it, we're in danger of creating our own Democratic version of the Tea Party that thrives on sour grapes and self-sabotage.\n", "id": "d28jvpm"}, {"comment": ">Democracy has made big sweeping revolutions obsolete.\n\nIf you think what we have right now is a democracy you haven't been doing your reading. A democracy rests on two principles:\n\n- the voters are educated\n- their interests are represented by their government\n\nWell, on both fronts we have been facing heavy erosion -- 1) the misinformation that a significant portion of the population are fed, and lack of information on other issues, as well as 2) the financial conflicts of interest present at all levels of government. Are you aware of the Princeton study showing that the US is not a democracy but an oligarchy?\n\n>When the preferences of the economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a miniscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.\n\nThat doesn't sound like a healthy democracy to me.\n\nThere is a stacked deck and it manifests itself in all aspects of politics. Huge amounts of capital are driving the machine of our society (and creating policies further sequestering wealth away from the majority creating it). Barring making new legislation, the president can still do quite a bit, provided there is a will to do so. But that's not even the end game.\n\nNo one thinks Sanders is going to fix everything on his own, especially not immediately. He is however the only person who is talking about these issues, who is proposing concrete progressive plans. He has taken clear decisive stances on critical issues facing this generation, and has served on pertinent committees in congress. There are quite a few concerns, climate change only being one of them, where immediate priority is needed. For instance, who the president appoints as the head of the EPA would be just one influential step.\n\nAnd Bernie has been talking about these same issues for years. His foresight on a range of vital decisions has been uncannily on point, and he is pushing for socialist policies and regulation which have been steadily dismantled since FDR helped bring the country out of the Great Depression. It's not so much that we need sweeping change for something new, we need to restore some core ideals to the US government, which have been overturned due to decades of legalized political corruption.\n\nWe've been playing the 'incremental' politics game for decades, and we've only succeeded in moving to the right. The Affordable Care Act has been long overdue yet nothing close to a real progressive healthcare system that the wealthiest country in the world should truly boast about. When your progressive candidate's healthcare plan was first similarly proposed by the Republican opposition, that's a bit telling. This congress has been the absolute worst, yet despite that Bernie has managed to get progressive amendments passed with bipartisan support.\n\nIf Bernie gets his support, that same wave of support can do something about it together down the line. That's where it's a revolution: empowering people to make a change. But for that to happen, we need an inside man, so to speak. Bernie has been that so far. He's not going to wave some magic wand. But we're going to get some political representation back as the populace that voted him in.\n\n>We're in danger of creating our own Democratic version of the Tea Party\n\nThat's an interesting point. It's possible and something to be wary of. I think that cycle of overpromise and underperformance has essentially been happening anyways, which is what has lead to such enormous dissatisfaction across the two parties. Because when the government isn't really representing you policy-wise, but the officials rely on your support to get elected in the first place, we will always have that cycle.\n\nNow I don't think it is a fair equivalence in this case, given that the points on the right fundamentally scapegoat and misinform in order to keep people in that cycle.", "id": "d28lh36"}, {"comment": "Hillary is NOT a good person at all, all the republicans are fucking nutcases and evil rich bastards.

They think all arabs hail from Bedouins just like all irish are drunks\n\nAnd when you have the \"angry arab\" stereotype from hollywood and you watch the news. What do you see? Tens of thousands of people going apeshit over drawings of the prophet. And that's not some single incident, that happened in many arab countries many times. That does more to negative arab stereotypes than hundreds of fictional movies.\n\nAlso, who takes True lies seriously? It's an Arnold movie from the 90's. EVERYONE in his movies from that time were bad jokes, stereotypical characters. Half the movies from that time has aliens and future robots that Arnold has to fight. Accuracy, historical or not has never been a hollywood strongpoint. Movies that takes place in some sort of historical event generally has historians that acts as consulents and mentioned in the end credits. The lesser known thing is that these consulents are very often just plainly ignored because the realism collides with entertainment value or the directors ideas.\n\nAlso, due to american lack of knowledge of anything not american, Hollywood does not differenciate between persians and arabs. The rules of engagement movie plot that he points out as most racist of them all seems to be based on Iranian breach of the vienna convention in it's utter failure to protect the US embassy and the following hostage crisis. So, while wrong, it's losely based on an actual event that seen with american ignorance belongs in the arab world.\n\nThen there is the argument that arab terrorists does not represent all arabs, like actions by KKK does not represent all americans. That is true, but when terrorist attacks create celebration in certain countries then there is a reason for concern.\n\nHow about the Lockerbie bomber.

How can someone celebrate a man like that?\n\nSo, when drawings of the prophet makes the arab world boil with rage, but when terrorists kills lots of people in the name of Allah, then there is almost nothing? Some officials make an official statement denouncing the attack. What does that imply?\n\nIt's awesome to see an arab standup comedian, his points about airports security was funny and on point. I think it's really important that you can joke about issues.
