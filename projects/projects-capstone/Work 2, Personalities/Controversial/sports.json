No one else has been able to do that, hell no one has even been able to keep Cousins personality as in check as Cal did in one year at UK. \n\nNot to mention that he advises kids to go pro for the betterment of themselves and their families when it is appropriate. He allows pro scouts to practices to get other players that are not as high profile as UK's blue chips to get attention from the pros (see Josh Harrelson being drafted). He doesn't try to get the kids to stay longer than needed for his own benefit (see Coach K, Bo Ryan, and Jim Boehim). \n\nI just don't understand the rap Calipari gets. I understand hating the one-and-done system, it is bad for college basketball but it's not Cal's rule. He's publicly stated that he would love to see it changed but somehow it's his fault?

On the other side you could go to the Acropolis, which is also a strip club, but the owners own a ranch and they sell steaks super cheap, like reeeally cheap. Sassy's is also always a great time if you like strip clubs.  Union Jacks for your alt/suicide girl type look.  I think Sassy's might be my favorite.  \n\nIf you're going the strip club route and do check out Casa Diablo, I'd check it out first, and then go to another club because Casa Diablo is kinda' in the middle of nowhere.  Sassy's and Union Jacks are more centrally located, so getting some food or hitting another bar would be easier and you wouldn't have to drive or uber around as much.\n\nThere are more rec weed shops than you can throw a stick at, so I wont get into that, find one, buy weed, get high.\n\nI'm mostly a food guy though so I can name a few of my favorite spots to eat, some more touristy than others:\n\n* Pine State - Reggie Deluxe all day. Get there before 11am otherwise there's usually a crazy line.\n\n* Salt and Straw - huge tourist draw. The lines can get ridiculous. But the ice cream is good. Plus its right across the street from Pine State if you go to the one on Alberta.  Also, if you go here, go to the one on Alberta, the location on 23rd always has a ridiculous line.\n\n* Brunch box - burgers where the buns are grilled cheese sandwiches, need I say more.\n\n* Podnah's Pit - best brisket in town imo.  If you go here you have to get the black-eyed-pea side.  I'd go there just for that side its so good.\n\n* Food carts galore!\n\n* Little Big Burger - the truffle fries are pretty good\n\n* Ox - if you like meat and wanna eat somewhere a little more upscale\n\n* Tasty and Alder - if you like meat and wanna eat somewhere even more upscale.  This would probably be my choice for a *special* meal.\n\n* Portland City Grill - Happy Hour. Best view of the city while drinking.  30th floor of the pink building downtown.  A little cliche for locals, but for people visiting, I'd say its pretty fun. Just be ready to vulture for a window table during happy hour, it gets really busy. \n\n* Departure - Bar on the top of the Nines hotel. Equally great view while drinking with an outdoor patio.\n\n* Killer Burger - the name says it all\n\n* Tilt - Burger place downtown in the pearl.\n\n* Salty's - If you're here on the weekend they have a great buffet brunch with a view of the river.  I think its one of the best brunches that we have here in Portland, plus its a buffet!  Its not cheap though.  \n\n* Authentica Mexican - upscale Mexican, which is constantly highly rated.\n\n* The People's Pig - great bbq'd pork sandwiches.  The sliced pork has amazing bark and smokey flavor!  I would also bathe in the vinegar condiment that they have at the tables its so good.\n\n* Basilik - Great chicken Sandwich\n\n* Bollywood Theatre - Indian food.  Although slightly expensive for their portion sizes.  But the chutney that they have there is soooo fucking good!\n\n* Pok Pok - (Touristy because it has been featured on multiple food shows) Authentic very unique Thai food.  Don't think pad thai. Its good af.  Although can get really busy.\n\n* Screen Door - (Touristy) The lines never seem worth it to me.  The food is good, but not if you have to wait in a long ass line.  If you happen to drive by and there isn't a line, or you go in the middle of the week you'll enjoy yourself.  \n\n* Toro Bravo - Great tapas place!  I've never not been happy with a meal there.\n\n* Sake - (http://www.sakethaior.com/) All you can eat Lunch buffet for $12.95!  Even if it was shitty (its not), that would still be a great deal!  \n\n* http://www.wweek.com/restaurant-guide-2015/ for more restaurants.\n\n\nIf you must go to Voodoo, go to Voodoo Too (1501 N.E. Davis St), not the one downtown. The one downtown is never worth the fucking wait.\n\nIf for some reason you decide to catch a movie while you're here, I'd recommend Cinetopia. The Beaverton location is probably the nicest, but the Vancouver Mall location has a shit ton of beers on tap. And if you're seated in the 21+ area you get in theatre service.\n\nIf you have a car...Edgefield. Go there. Its fun. They even have a cigar bar there too.  You may be able to get an Uber out there too, so theres also that.  But remember to bring a jacket, because all the bars out there are spaced out around the property.  \n\nIf I was visiting (and smoked weed) I would find a shop, get high.  Then go to Pine State for breakfast, maybe hit up Salt and Straw across the street (if you go to the one on Alberta) and finish off the nite with a drink at Portland City Grill overlooking the city.\n\nGround Kontrol and the new Quarterworld are both barcades.  Just don't hit up GK on a weekend nite, its usually packed.  GK has sooooo many pinball machines.  Haven't been to Quarterworld yet so I can't really comment on them.\n\nPittock Mansion has a great view of the city, and if you're up that way you could check out the Japanese Gardens and the Rose Gardens as well.\n\nIf you like books, and have read anything about the tourist spots in Portland, I'm sure you already know about Powells.  And even though its like the number one tourist spot in Portland other than Voodoo, its still pretty fun.  \n\nIn terms of bars it really depends on what sort of scene that you're going for.  Are you looking for a \"bro\" type atmosphere?  Henry's in the pearl, Blitz or any of the bars in Oldtown.  Alt/punk type scene?  Star Bar, East Burn.  Shitty dive bar?  Yamhill pub, Kelly's Olympian, Suki's.  \n\nEither way, if you guys are visiting I would for sure try and check out the Bar at Portland City Grill or Departure.  Definitely the best view you can have of our city while drinking at a bar.  Just know that Portland City Grill Happy hour can get kinda' crazy with people *vulturing* for window tables.  \n\n\n", "id": "d8te67w"}, {"comment": "/r/unexpectedtourguide", "id": "d8tn3qj"}, {"comment": "I think we just found the analyst and talent scout for the american olympic team on strippers. \n\n", "id": "d8tr0vt"}, {"comment": "I must visit from Seattle methinks...", "id": "d8tjavv"}, {"comment": "What qualifies somebody as a professional pole dancer then?

Barbados vs Grenada in the 1994 Caribbean Cup. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados_4\u20132_Grenada_(1994_Caribbean_Cup_qualification)\n\nThere were two rules in place that lead to the bizarre circumstances of this match. It was the last match of Group stage and at this point the only way Barbados was going to be able to move out of the group stage was if they won the game by 2 points due to a loss in a previous match compared to Grenada's wins. The other abnormal rule was that the tournament was using a variance of the golden rule, where the first goal in overtime resulted in a win, but in this case instead of counting as one goal, the overtime goal would count as two. \n\nNow, to the weird circumstances. Barbados was up 2-0 as the game was coming to a close. With five to ten minutes left, Grenada scored and brought the game to 2-1. This result would mean that Grenada would move out of the groups instead of Barbados. After a couple of minutes of trying to score on Grenada, the Barbados team realized something. If they instead score an own goal, they would tie the game up at 2-2 and force an overtime, where if they scored they would be rewarded with *two* points and have enough to move out of the group stage. For the next couple minutes, if Barbados scored in *either* goal, they would either move forward or have a chance in overtime. For a couple minutes Grenada was forced to focus on protecting both goals, and eventually Barbados scored a self-goal, tying the game at 2-2. \n\nThis then flipped the situation. At 2-2, Grenada also had two choices. Score on Barbados and win at 3-2, or score their *own* self-goal and allow Barbados to win at 3-2, but not winning by their required margin and still allowing Grenada to advance. \n\nFor the last couple minutes, Barbados was able to successfully protect both goals, and forced the game into overtime. There they scored the first goal, won the match 4-2, and sent Grenada packing. The only game in history I believe where during the last ten minutes in regular time, both teams had moments where scoring a goal at either end would have acted as a benefit for the team. \n", "id": "d80hhdo"}, {"comment": "What the fuck lol thats amazing", "id": "d80ln3f"}, {"comment": "In 1994, Barbados could advance to the final round of a particular tournament if they won against Grenada by 2 goals, or in overtime.

Deciding to pay the same prize money for a tournament is a bit of a farcry from the supposed double standards that women are allowed more money than men for a job but men aren't allowed more than women.

I don't understand why you don't want to fix something that is unfair.\n\nBecause it isn't. It isn't unfair. It harms nobody. The whole point of equal pay is because people would take advantage of it not existing and pay certain people less. In an office job for example, paying person A less than person B despite them doing the same job and having the same role is wrong because it is exploitative. This is prize money, it's not a wage, person A is not being paid less than person B despite doing the same thing. They are doing different things and they chose to give both set of people the same money. If Serena Williams was being paid less than Kerber when they both reached the final that would be unfair. (Although of course the winner of the game deserves more). Being paid the same as mens tennis which is separate from womens tennis isn't the same thing. It quite simply isn't. Most people don't complain about it, it doesn't hurt anyone plus there are actual laws in place over equal pay. In the UK there is the equal pay Act, the prize money for Wimbledon does not violate that, common sense tells you why that's not the case. It doesn't break the law and it is perfectly fine, it doesn't need to be fixed. \n\nI'm assuming you're American, I don't know about American sports but I will use football (soccer) as an example, if you don't watch football this might be lost on you so I won't refer to specific instances. But a team can have player A and player B, they both play the same position and role but player A gets paid \u00a390k p/w and player B gets paid \u00a330 K p/w. Player A plays 17 games for his club, player B plays 35 games for the same club. How is it fair that player B is playing more games but getting considerably less? And this isn't a prize money, this is weekly wages. Equal pay doesn't just refer to gender, it refers to race, what if player A is white and player B black, in fact it just applies in general regardless or race, gender, etc. But guess what? Nobody cares if player B doing more work is getting paid less. And certainly most people don't care about the tennis situation because it literally is not a big deal.

What you're saying makes no sense and is deluded.\nYou completely fail to understand how equal pay works. It exists so in a workplace people aren't payed less for a reason such as sex, race, etc. Womens tennis and mens tennis isn't even the same thing, they are two different jobs considering one is for women, one is for men. If Serene Williams was paid less then Kerber for reaching the final that would be unfair and against the equal pay act. If Federer gets paid less than Murray for reaching the final that would be unfair and a against the equal pay act. But two people in two different jobs, no matter how related they are are not affected by equal pay in that way. And most people, most normal people don't complain about it because it isn't a big deal.

Unlike American sports, with European football, if a team in the upper league does poorly enough, the entire team gets sent down into the weaker league starting the following season -- this is called relegation.  Similarly, weaker teams doing well can move up a league, this is called promotion.  Leicester played in the lower leagues below the Premier League for ten years until they were promoted for the 2014-2015 season, however they struggled last year and were in danger of being relegated again.\n\nUsually, in most leagues in Europe, the top teams in the top leagues are four of five of the richer teams, usually with long histories of dominance (EDIT: there are many reasons for this, which I won't go into for the sake of brevity, but some comments below discuss it). The Premier League isn't that different, particularly in recent history. For the past 20 years, only Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, and Chelsea have ever won the Premier League -- and usually many times over.  In English football, there are a few teams with long and storied histories of victories, these include the teams mentioned above (some with longer histories than others) as well as Liverpool and Everton, others were better in earlier eras, and then there are few teams like Leicester (established in 1884) that are just smaller, poorer teams with mostly regional support, who had never won anything.\n\nIt is as if an American team that had one of the worst seasons in Major League history the previous year, a team that had never won anything or even come close, had the best record in the league for the entire season and swept every playoff and then the World Series to win it.

I'm no soccer fan but this is an amazing underdog story indeed.", "id": "d2q5stc"}, {"comment": "To put it simply, the Premier League has been around for 23 seasons. Before today, only five different teams had ever won it: Manchester United (who have won an astonishing 13 of those titles), Blackburn Rovers (who won only one title in the league's third season before falling off), Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City.\n\nBecause of the way club finances work in soccer, it's very hard for a team to suddenly compete for a title. The best clubs make significantly more money than all of the rest because of the attention they get, allowing them to pay the world's best players much more money than other clubs can, which works out well because the best players will want to play for the best clubs all else being equal, giving top clubs a sort of monopoly on success. Chelsea, City, and even Blackburn to a lesser extent, spent years in a process where each offseason they would spend massive amounts of money from their billionaire owners to attract players who were the caliber of a team slightly higher up in the standings. When they reached a league position that reflected the quality of their players, they would dump them, and reload with even better ones at an even higher price, and on and on for a few years until they finally worked their way up to being Champions.\n\nEnter Leicester. Last year was their first season in the Premier League, having been promoted by virtue of being the best team in the league below it. More often than not, teams that are promoted are immediately sent back down by virtue of being one of the worst teams in the subsequent Premier League season, simply because the jump in the quality of play is so high that the teams don't have the resources to compete. Leicester last year very narrowly avoided this fate by winning almost all of their games in the last two months of the season, which was already near-miraculous. Then, in the off-season, they fired their manager and hired a guy who had just been dropped from coaching the Greek national team within four months of being hired because he lost to the Faroe Islands (pop. 50,000). \n\nThey were widely tipped to go back down a league this year. Instead, they somehow won the title. They never made any big player transfers, never even gave the possibility of competing any serious consideration until a few months into this season, nothing. They just went out and did it. It's completely unprecedented. There are a number of teams that have spent billions of dollars over the course of decades just hoping to make fourth place on a consistent basis and have come up short. There are players on Manchester United's bench that cost more than the entire title-winning Leicester squad.

Unlike American sports, with European football, if a team in the upper league does poorly enough, the entire team gets sent down into the weaker league starting the following season -- this is called relegation.  Similarly, weaker teams doing well can move up a league, this is called promotion.  Leicester played in the lower leagues below the Premier League for ten years until they were promoted for the 2014-2015 season, however they struggled last year and were in danger of being relegated again.\n\nUsually, in most leagues in Europe, the top teams in the top leagues are four of five of the richer teams, usually with long histories of dominance (EDIT: there are many reasons for this, which I won't go into for the sake of brevity, but some comments below discuss it). The Premier League isn't that different, particularly in recent history. For the past 20 years, only Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, and Chelsea have ever won the Premier League -- and usually many times over.  In English football, there are a few teams with long and storied histories of victories, these include the teams mentioned above (some with longer histories than others) as well as Liverpool and Everton, others were better in earlier eras, and then there are few teams like Leicester (established in 1884) that are just smaller, poorer teams with mostly regional support, who had never won anything.\n\nIt is as if an American team that had one of the worst seasons in Major League history the previous year, a team that had never won anything or even come close, had the best record in the league for the entire season and swept every playoff and then the World Series to win it.  I think that is only thing that would come close to how amazing this is, and it still doesn't do it justice.", "id": "d2q5xuq"}, {"comment": "> Leicester played in the league below the Premier League for ten years until they were promoted for the 2014-2015 season\n\nActually no.

Moreso than the professional counterpart.  This is due to rivalries between specific schools forged over many years of hard fought games between highly competitive colleges.\n\nThe picture here shows a game from Michigan versus Ohio State, arguably the biggest and most famous rivalry in all of American sports, including professional sports.  Ohio State is a massive, massive school and their stadium can hold upwards of 110k people, and indeed set a record for it with this game.  Michigan is just behind OSU on the magnitude chart.  On top of that Michigan and Ohio State are both competing for 1 of 4 coveted spots in the College Football Playoffs.  Whoever wins probably gets in, as they are both ranked 3 and 4 out of all the teams in the FBS division of college football (128 total).  I mention this so you can get a picture of how important this game is to sports fans.\n\nAnyway, so the picture shows the Ohio State QB, J.T. Barrett, crossing the first down marker late in the game in order to keep Ohio State's hopes of winning the game alive.  It was fourth and short, which meant that had he not crossed the yellow line (superimposed on the TV broadcast, it's not actually there in real life) then Ohio State would have lost.  When J.T. Barrett was approaching the first down, he was hit by several Michigan players and pinwheeled across the first down marker.  In real time it looked as if he was blatantly short, but was called for a first down anyway.  When Michigan challenged the play, there wasn't enough evidence in stop footage and slow motion to overturn the call without a question of doubt, thus giving OSU the ball.  OSU then scored later in that drive, forced overtime, and eventually won in overtime, thus pissing off all of Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nNow this is a controversial call.  In the original picture it looks as if Barrett crossed the plane, but there are several angles to this shot that show the ball not crossing the yard marker (the ball's position is what matters, not the player).  However, because it's not 100% conclusive, the refs couldn't overturn the call.  This is on top of a long game of one sided officiating and favorable spots for OSU.\n\nIn my opinion I think Barrett crossed the plane.

The restaurants don't give a fuck if you tip or not, they already get their money when you pay your bill (which you are legally required to do, obviously). If you really wanted to protest the industry's practices of requiring tips for a waiter to make a living wage, the only real way to do that would be to not eat out.\n\nIn general, waiters make a pretty decent living because the vast, vast majority of people tip when they eat out.

In practice, however, it doesn't. Studies have shown that people tip at a basically uniform rate except in *extreme* situations of exceptionally bad or exceptionally good service. \n\nIt's a stupid system, I agree, but if you're in the US, just be aware that not tipping at all will make you look like an enormous asshole because wait staff literally require tips in order to make a living wage.
