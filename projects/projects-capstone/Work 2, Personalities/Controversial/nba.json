But to be fair, if he cared *only* about winning he would have passed the ball more at the end of games. Since his % was really poor. But I think Kobe trusted only himself in those situations, and he had a bit of an ego. He also *could* hit a shot from pretty much anywhere over anyone, so he took them, and the Lakers lived with it. They did win 5 titles, so it looks like it worked out pretty well.\n\nBut I do think the clutch thing is a bit overrated from Kobe, simply because he hit some RIDICULOUS shots that were super clutch.

So he naturally became more of a loner. He would just play ball and take out all of his rage and frustration that way. And this guy would practice like no other. Very few players in the history of the game can match Kobe's work ethic. So naturally he was very confident in his game because of the amount of work he had put in. And he had said that he had never viewed practicing as much as he did as work or a chore. He did it because he loved it. \n\nWhen he finally came to the NBA and saw how his work ethic compared to some of his peers', he finally realized how what he was doing was more drastic in terms of practicing on his craft. So he always felt that he would have a better chance at hitting a baseline fadeaway over one or two players than having an open teammate take a contested/open shot. He would be willing to take the blame if he missed, but wouldn't want someone who hadn't worked half as hard as him to miss it. But in the earlier years when they had the 3peat team, Kobe would be willing to defer to an open Rick Fox or Robert Horry for example. He would still rely on himself more, but he at least passed it up more often. Once he fully came into his prime, and his team sucked, he started giving it up less and less and that kind of stuck.\nOn the 08-12 team, he still would attempt most of the shots himself but would be willing to give up the ball to D-fish and Ron Artest/MWP sometimes (NBA Finals game 7).

You act like the Warriors of last season had control over their opponents injuries. You act like adding 2 straight up bad defenders means the Cavs would have been so much better they could have taken down the clear favourites (remember how much credit Delly got for slowing Steph?). In fact, it's been brought up many times since last season how the Warriors would have feasted if they had gone up against the 2 worst defenders on the Cavs. Now don't take that as me saying the Cavs wouldn't have been better with those two, but that brings me to my next point. This is something that is rarely mentioned (unsurprisingly considering the topic is usually started by people who want to discredit the Warriors), but the two wins Cleveland had that series, they won by a *combined* 7 points (one win in OT). Golden State then proceeded to crush them in 3 straight\n\nNow if the Warriors had come out this season and been unspectacular, I'd understand - but still disagree with - people saying it was due to luck.

Greatness is a function of opinion; what people think of you and what people think you provided for your team. The fact that a large majority of people think that he took an \"easy\" way out is an argument that he took a direct step in the opposite direction of greatness.

In-fact, Oladipo's lack of efficiency is why he ended up on Orlando's bench last season in favor of guys like Fournier.  So hoping for 44 wins might be a bit optimistic if Durant leaves the THunder.

He commits an absurd number of fouls and turnovers. He regularly takes plays off throughout every game, usually to argue with referees. He also is incredibly inefficient for a big man, as many of his shot attempts are simply flailing at the basket to get a foul. He also takes a lot of dumb midrange jumpers, and took WAY too many 3s for a Center last year.\n\nHaving said that, a locked-in DeMarcus Cousins is close to a Top 5 NBA player. When he is committed on both ends, works in the paint, and keeps his cool, he is damn near unstoppable. He is a threat to go for 30+ points and 15+ rebounds on a nightly basis. IMO he's the most dominant big man since Shaq when he's locked in and focused. The problem is that those times have been pretty rare during the last 6 seasons.\n\nI think if he had the right personnel around him, not only on the floor but in the Front Office and coaching staff, he would be unstoppable. The problem is getting him there. It seems like he values having control nearly as much as he values the production on the floor. During his time in Sacramento, it seems as though the only times when Cousins has been truly locked in are when he was getting exactly what he wanted from the franchise, which is a bad precedent to set. \n\nLastly, bringing up Rondo's comments is pointless.

His reputation as a locker room cancer, immature etc is just a product of the Kings' unstable situation throughout the years he's been there and media people overreacting.\n\nThe first coach to ever reach him was Malone. The Kings fired Malone and Cousins who was supposed to be their franchise player learned it via Twitter. Then, the Kings hired George Karl who amid trade rumours said that nobody is untradable on the Kings' roster. What exactly would you expect Cousins to do? Let me ask you another question. Name a top 20 player who would not get mad at his coach if he declared him tradeable in a media session.\n\nMy final point, if you play your home games in Oakland you are considered the heart and the soul of a championship contender, a vocal leader and a true fighter.

WTF do you expect??)"], [3, "He is overrated in some ways and underrated in others.\n\nHis post game is overrated among general NBA fans, and some Kings fans. He is above average in the post, but not the best. This past year he attempted to drive to the basket from the 3pt line, and he got stripped a lot as he was going to the hoop.\n\nI have a few problems with how he acts. First, if there is a bad call, get back on defense for goodness sake. I don't need you sacrificing defense for the sake of an argument with a referee. We need you on defense. Second, just cut down on the techs. Again, we need you on the court. That's about it.\n\nI chose to be a Kings fan beginning 2 seasons ago, and I can confidently say that the firings of Michael Malone, Tyrone Corbin, and George Karl was *not* the fault of DeMarcus. But *was he a factor* in at least *one* of these firings? Yes. It is clear and obvious that DeMarcus had *nothing* to do with the firing of Michael Malone and Tyrone Corbin. Heck, DeMarcus said that, during the Corbin era, he chose not to comment about any replacement coaches to the media because that would be disrespectful to Tyrone Corbin. But George Karl... it's somewhat debatable as to whether or not DeMarcus should be labeled a \"coach killer\" because of that. The fans have always questioned and sometimes even hated Karl's schemes throughout the entire season, long before he was fired. Our switching scheme made it so that it was a normal sight to see Rondo getting backed down in the post. We would also occasionally see Rudy Gay as our center, when we weren't tall enough to play Warriors small-ball. This scheme also featured DeMarcus at either the 3pt line (where he would get stripped on drives), or Marco Belinelli fadeaways that Rondo liked to call often (Belinelli wasn't that good at floppy sets). Caron Butler said that Karl lost the locker room by All-Star break, and that the team was disappointed (? I don't know if \"disappointed\" was the word that he used) when they discovered that Karl wasn't fired by All-Star break. So yes, of course there would be tensions between DeMarcus and Karl, between the team and Karl, when you have a scheme that didn't really work out, except for the fastbreak parts. We got some easy points that way.\n\nDeMarcus was grossly misused this season. He should have been used at the mid or elbow range from either the pick and pop or the mid-post feed. Instead, he was placed at either the 3pt line (ew) or in the post (O.K.) but wasn't used to his full potential. Now, if he returns to the mid-range area, will he be as effective as he once was? Maybe not, if he forgot how to operate in the mid-range. That's a concern.\n\nThis year, I have a feeling that we will be seeing a lot of mid-range/elbow feeds to Cousins, based off of the sets that our players ran during summer league. We tried to post up WCS, Skal, and others, and failed miserably for the most part.

Keep in mind though, Tim Duncan is notorious for whining to the refs. LeBron very obviously took a lot of plays/games off on defense during the regular season. This stuff alone isn't automatically damning.\n\nI think its actually a bit telling that he hasn't demanded a trade though. You have to think that if it was really mostly the organization/coaching staffs fault and he really wanted to win, play the right way, and possibly not be \"the guy\" that gets to do whatever he wants he would have done that by now.\n\nI think its a combination of Cousins lacking discipline and being stubborn and an organization that has empowered him too much. Ultimately his problems and the organizational problems have just fed off each other, making the team so incredibly dysfunctional.\n\nIf he was traded to Boston or whatever today, he wouldn't immediately become the perfect player with none of those problems. But he probably wouldn't turn the Celtics into the Kings either.\n\nIf I were a team with a strong culture/coaching staff in place I would 100% trade for him.

I looked at Centers, Power Forwards, and Combo Forwards. Since you brought up career TS% to compare Boogie to Hakeem, I went ahead and used the same metric to compare Boogie to other \"bigs\" that shot similar TS% and also ranked in the Top 20 in PPG. Here's the list:\n\n[Boogie](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/couside01.html#advanced::none): 52.6%\n\n[Rudy Gay](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gayru01.html#advanced::none): 53.1%\n\n[Andrea Bargnani](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bargnan01.html): 53.1%\n\n[Al Jefferson](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jeffeal01.html): 52.7%\n\n[Zach Randolph](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/randoza01.html): 52.4%\n\n[Antawn Jamison](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamisan01.html): 52.3%\n\n[Al Harrington](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harrial01.html): 52.3%\n\n[Michael Beasley](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/beaslmi01.html): 50.9%\n\n[Josh Smith](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithjo03.html): 50.4%\n\nOne notable thing I gathered from this list is that there are no Centers that scored lower than Boogie in career TS%. Al Jefferson is the closest one, but even he has Boogie beat. Also, 2 of these guys were primarily SFs for most of their careers, and not exactly great examples of efficient scorers (Josh Smith and Beasley). Hell, even Rudy Gay, supposedly the premier inefficient chucker in the NBA, has a higher career TS% than Boogie.\n\nAnother things I noticed is that nearly every one of the true big men on this list had multiple seasons shooting >50% FG%. Boogie and Al Harrington are the only ones I could find without a 50% or greater FG% season.\n\nSo, again, I don't really understand why you're bringing up Hakeem in this conversation.

He also is incredibly inefficient for a big man, as many of his shot attempts are simply flailing at the basket to get a foul. He also takes a lot of dumb midrange jumpers, and took WAY too many 3s for a Center last year.\n\nHaving said that, a locked-in DeMarcus Cousins is close to a Top 5 NBA player. When he is committed on both ends, works in the paint, and keeps his cool, he is damn near unstoppable. He is a threat to go for 30+ points and 15+ rebounds on a nightly basis. IMO he's the most dominant big man since Shaq when he's locked in and focused. The problem is that those times have been pretty rare during the last 6 seasons.\n\nI think if he had the right personnel around him, not only on the floor but in the Front Office and coaching staff, he would be unstoppable. The problem is getting him there. It seems like he values having control nearly as much as he values the production on the floor. During his time in Sacramento, it seems as though the only times when Cousins has been truly locked in are when he was getting exactly what he wanted from the franchise, which is a bad precedent to set. \n\nLastly, bringing up Rondo's comments is pointless.

He is above average in the post, but not the best. This past year he attempted to drive to the basket from the 3pt line, and he got stripped a lot as he was going to the hoop.\n\nI have a few problems with how he acts. First, if there is a bad call, get back on defense for goodness sake. I don't need you sacrificing defense for the sake of an argument with a referee. We need you on defense. Second, just cut down on the techs. Again, we need you on the court. That's about it.\n\nI chose to be a Kings fan beginning 2 seasons ago, and I can confidently say that the firings of Michael Malone, Tyrone Corbin, and George Karl was *not* the fault of DeMarcus. But *was he a factor* in at least *one* of these firings? Yes. It is clear and obvious that DeMarcus had *nothing* to do with the firing of Michael Malone and Tyrone Corbin. Heck, DeMarcus said that, during the Corbin era, he chose not to comment about any replacement coaches to the media because that would be disrespectful to Tyrone Corbin. But George Karl... it's somewhat debatable as to whether or not DeMarcus should be labeled a \"coach killer\" because of that. The fans have always questioned and sometimes even hated Karl's schemes throughout the entire season, long before he was fired. Our switching scheme made it so that it was a normal sight to see Rondo getting backed down in the post. We would also occasionally see Rudy Gay as our center, when we weren't tall enough to play Warriors small-ball. This scheme also featured DeMarcus at either the 3pt line (where he would get stripped on drives), or Marco Belinelli fadeaways that Rondo liked to call often (Belinelli wasn't that good at floppy sets). Caron Butler said that Karl lost the locker room by All-Star break, and that the team was disappointed (? I don't know if \"disappointed\" was the word that he used) when they discovered that Karl wasn't fired by All-Star break. So yes, of course there would be tensions between DeMarcus and Karl, between the team and Karl, when you have a scheme that didn't really work out, except for the fastbreak parts. We got some easy points that way.\n\nDeMarcus was grossly misused this season. He should have been used at the mid or elbow range from either the pick and pop or the mid-post feed. Instead, he was placed at either the 3pt line (ew) or in the post (O.K.) but wasn't used to his full potential. Now, if he returns to the mid-range area, will he be as effective as he once was? Maybe not, if he forgot how to operate in the mid-range. That's a concern.\n\nThis year, I have a feeling that we will be seeing a lot of mid-range/elbow feeds to Cousins, based off of the sets that our players ran during summer league. We tried to post up WCS, Skal, and others, and failed miserably for the most part.

Keep in mind though, Tim Duncan is notorious for whining to the refs. LeBron very obviously took a lot of plays/games off on defense during the regular season. This stuff alone isn't automatically damning.\n\nI think its actually a bit telling that he hasn't demanded a trade though. You have to think that if it was really mostly the organization/coaching staffs fault and he really wanted to win, play the right way, and possibly not be \"the guy\" that gets to do whatever he wants he would have done that by now.\n\nI think its a combination of Cousins lacking discipline and being stubborn and an organization that has empowered him too much. Ultimately his problems and the organizational problems have just fed off each other, making the team so incredibly dysfunctional.\n\nIf he was traded to Boston or whatever today, he wouldn't immediately become the perfect player with none of those problems.

That seems like a reach to me. Am I off base here?\n\nI'm not saying Lebron can't be offended by the word, but I'm trying to understand what context makes it offensive. Because, to me, it seems like the word is just kinda secondary to the context its in. Like if the old racist granny sees her neighbors walking by and calls up the police and says \"There is a suspicious group of black men walking down the street\" is the word \"group\" racist? No, its a racist person using a non-racist word. I'm not saying Lebron's experiences with the words are invalid, but his experience doesn't invalidate everyone else's and means that word is racist.\n\nThis whole thing just rubs me the wrong way. Saying that stuff about Phil seems like bringing a nuke to a spitball fight. I'll buy that he was dismissive of his friends and their relationship, but their relationship wasn't the subject he was talking about. And I still don't see how its racist.\n\nI know you said I'm just defending Phil because I'm a Knicks fan, but I've lived my entire life in Ohio and Lebron is huge here. He's one of my favorite players to watch and he's done a lot of good for the communities here, but this seems *extremely* petty.", "id": "da3hdak"}, {"comment": "What are you even talking about? His point is literally that Phil used *posse* with a clearly negative connotation. \n\n>their posse's, who fetch their cars and their girls\n\nI'd get offended too if my business partners were called that way. \n\nThe message Phil tries to convey is fine.

Most rich people have a bodyguard that doubles as a driver and is part of the group. He's friends with his business partners. He is in business with his friends. That in no way denigrates their friendship or business acumen, it isn't even a commentary on that. The message is that Phil was worried about whether or not Lebron is surrounding himself with good people. This is from 2004 and nobody had an issue with it then. \n\nThe people who you surround yourself with are part of your posse. The managers at my company go to lunch with each other and its \"Tim's posse\". I have cousins flying in for the holidays and we asked if the rest of their posse are coming.

Watch a few of the Portland games last series closely, he played great defense on Lillard, especially in crunch time. \n\nKlay is also large and fast enough to be able to switch. While he's not at the same level defensively as guys like James, Leonard, and George on the wing, he allows the Warrior's defensive schemes the versatility it needs.\n\nOne thing that you sorta touched upon in your comment is that Klay isn't a great off-ball defender- this is true, its probably his only weakness on defense. Sometimes he's not quite quick enough to catch the fastest guards running around screens. However, I'd say that he's still pretty good at playing this brand of defense in comparison to a lot of his peers. That shit is hard. He makes up for his lack of speed in great footwork and strength. \n\nYou also said that most stats say that he's below average. I don't really like defensive stats that much because good defense can be hard to quantify. However, I did look up some stats after I read your post, and I noticed some interesting figures. Klay's opponents shoot worse against Klay on average on every type of shot. They shoot significantly worse on long jumpers, but they also tend to shoot more of these types of shots against Klay, presumably because of his ability to stay in front of them and run them off the three point line. There's no other way to put it: that's really good defense. Its not great (like the d of Lebron and Kawhi), but its enough to propel the Warriors into a consistently top ranking defense. \n\nOne of the things I actually really like about defense is that its not usually a superstar stat- you need multiple contributors, and Klay is one of them on the Warriros. \n\n", "id": "d3nueyp"}, {"comment": "I think you make some valid points. Klay works well within the system the Warriors have in place on D. However the great defenders in the league create turnovers and extra possessions, which are some of the most valuable during a game.

He can guard smaller guards though, which is incredibly useful and frees Curry up to help off of weaker defenders and gamble more for steals.

It's not a number that's going to make teams respect your spacing.  And you don't have any one particular player who is going to command a ton of gravity.

Did you even think to look that up? God damn. \n\nMorrow, Ilyasova, and Kanter have all shot way over 33% for their careers (37%+), Oladipo has shot over 33%, Cam Payne was 32.4% last season, and I expect him to improve if he can stay healthy (he's got a sweet stroke, and he was a good shooter in college, but his foot was really a problem last season). Abrines and Sabonis are rookies, but I expect both of them to shoot over 33%, Sabonis didn't take many 3s in college, but he shot well enough when he did, and he shot well in the preseason. Hopefully Abrines will get close to 40%, as he shot over 40% in Europe the last 3 seasons and shot very well in the preseason. There's my 7. \n\nThen I'm seeing improvement from Singler (who by the way is a 37% career shooter), his confidence seems to be back, and he's a great shooter when he's on. Josh Huestis also shown he was a decent shooter last season, but he only played 5 games so obviously I don't expect him to shoot 66%, but I think over 33% is definitely reasonable. Those two I'm iffy on, but if they remain comfortable and confident I think they'll do well. \n\n\nJoffrey Lauvergne has shot very poorly from 3 thus far, but he has improved a little every year, and he was taking them in the preseason, so I don't know what to make of that. (I'm not really counting him here, though his midrange game is pretty legit, and that can help to space the floor)\n\n\nThese players are all getting rotational minutes, and most of the guys I mentioned have shot over 35% for their careers, I just went with 33% because that's league average (and if you shoot lower than that, you probably aren't going to be shooting many 3s). 33% is equivalent to 50% from 2, so if defenders aren't guarding that, they're making mistakes. \n\nIf they clog the paint, we'll be shooting open shots.

Yes, I looked everyone's numbers up.  I forgot about Singler because your fanbase has shit on him so much I honestly have a hard time believing he's playable.  If he figures things out, that could be huge though.\n\nKanter has taken 0.2 3 pointers per game in his career, so that's not exactly a data point.  \n\nWith rookies, it's tough to tell, but in general it's a tough spot if you're expecting them to be some of the better shooters on the team.\n\nPlus, how many of these guys will be rotation players?  Most teams don't go much more than 9 or 10 deep. Sabonis, Abrines and Huestis are unlikely to get meaningful minutes.  And as I said, Donovan seems hesitant to play Morrow.  \n\nIlyasova is the one guy who will get a lot of playing time who's already proven himself as a shooter.  Oladipo is improving every year, so you're probably more correct about him than I am.  \n\nStill.  That's two pretty reliable shooters that will be getting a decent amount of minutes.  Three if Singler gets plenty of playing time, and one elite shooter if Morrow gets more minutes than last year.\n\nI'm not trying to rain on your parade.  I just don't think that it's a great shooting team in the ecology of the NBA.  Most teams have better shooting cores.  You'll be battling it out with the Grizzlies, Rockets, Blazers, Jazz, and maybe (big maybe) T-Wolves.  \n\nThe Grizzlies and the T-Wolves are the worst shooters of the bunch and they each at least have a couple elite shooters that can be relied on night in and night out.

I do expect all 10 of the players I talked about to get meaningful minutes. With Russ and Adams making 12, which is a little much, but it's not unheard of. If anyone is sitting nightly it's probably Huestis and Morrow. Though I do like what Huestis brings defensively, and I hope Morrow gets some minutes when we don't need defense. Maybe Lauvergne will sit too if we're playing with shorter rotations. \n\n\nOf course all of this is conjecture at this point, but I'm fairly confident we've got enough shooting.

Dangerous move from WB. Lucky he didn't hit Iggy or should have been a flagrant\n\n2. Klay stumbles off of the Adams screen and Westbrook sees Klay is going to hit him as he shoots so he exaggerates the contact so the refs call it. Players do this all the time, if they don't they might not get the foul. Klay was stumbling head first into Russ as he hit the shot, but good job making it sound like Russ initiated that whole thing so he could kick Klay in the face\n\n3. Livingston fouls him by pulling his shirt as he drives to the basket, so Russ counters by jumping back into him for the foul. He can feel Livingston is all over him so he takes the shot. He was being fouled already and it wasn't being called. Fuck him for making his own luck right?\n\n4. Seriously, is this post a joke? Bogut LEANS ACROSS while they are both moving to impede him. Are his feet set? No because he's not even in front of him. He sees the contact and tries to turn it into a shooting foul. It's smart basketball. Bogut was fouling him first. Are you just watching Russ and no one else?\n\n5. This is why people talk about Russell's insane athletic ability. Steph jumps in front of him. No feet set. No charge. He literally just tries to slow him down at the risk of having a foul called and Russ manages to literally drive through him to still get to the rim. Do you even understand how fouls work in basketball? He doesn't even flail on this shot he demonstrates great body control, why did you say he \"flails into Steph\".\n\n6. Refs fault not sure what it has to do with Russell. Russ fades on the shot and falls backwards. Sure you might be able to argue it was a flop, I'm not sure that it isn't just him protecting his ankles by falling back naturally. Steph does this on fades a lot so he doesn't roll his ankles. \n\n7. Yeah I could see this being an offensive foul for him trying to draw contact.

I promise you that you'll gain some study buddies if you mess up the curve again on Exam #2. \n\nGame respects game, and disrespect is excused in the name of entertainment.\n\nBitchassness is never excused.

Our coaching, defense, transition play- is still going to be good without Steph. Our offense will suffer but we have options and the players will still be comfortable and play their game. We lost the best bail-out option and decoy in the league, but we can still win games.\n\nThe Cavaliers need LeBron to be their emotional and basketball leader. Without him, they are just plain bad.

Lebron is put on people all the time to slow them down. Not all of that is good, it doesn't even make him a better player, I'm just saying quantitatively he does more.

I would say of all time if it wasn't for Wilt(never got to see him play). Shaq could just bully anyone, his shear weight and strength were too much for anyone and he had a couple strong hook/pivot moves after he put someone off balance. \n\nBut, if you're asking who is the best center ever(or even of the 90s) I don't think it's as cut and dry.

Kyrie is hurt by the fact that Harden (a top 5 overall player) is now a de facto PG for the first time. (This is based on official position. He's run point from time to time before but he's never been officially listed as PG until this year as far as I know.)\n\n2. If you add Conley, Kemba, and Lowry to your list, you have a solid 10.  Looking at total BPM, Kyrie is 10th this season, with 9th OBPM and 8th in DBPM.  He's pretty clearly not top 6 if you look at the advanced statistics. \n\n3.  He is, however, 7th in usage, with most of these PGs handling the ball and being otherwise involved in a huge proportion of total team possessions. More possessions will almost always translate to higher BPM, especially when you're the go-to guy on your team. \n\n4.  I can't quantitatively rank with regards to which players specifically sacrifice personal stats due to team construction, team play style, position logjams, etc. but qualitatively, the argument could be made for Lowry, Conley and CP3 as the only players with less of a 'green light to get their stats' than Kyrie, and in the case of Conley and CP3 their team style actually compliments their styles. \n\n5. Not everybody gets to play with Lebron, KD, and Griffin, sure, but Kyrie, Curry, and CP3 on a different level with regards to team record. It's one thing to get awesome stats and win moderately, it's another thing to be the primary PG on a conference-leading team.  \n\n6. Back to subjectivity, Kyrie, subjectively, has some incredible handle. He finishes well around the basket, and he shoots well.  He may be slightly less efficient this season, but the sample size is extremely small right now.  Relative to other PGs (and regardless of rank) his deficiencies are not so material that he's OBVIOUSLY in any given tier. These things are nuanced and while I tend to think he's probably ranked 7th on my own very subjective list, he could easily fluctuate as high as fourth or fifth.  That said, I think if you could simply drag and drop all these PGs to other teams, you'd see very little differentiation from God-tier (RWB, Harden, Curry) and the rest of these guys, with the exception of CP3 who in my opinion is alone in his \"pass-first-past-his-prime-superstar-veteran\" tier, which is Tier 2A while the rest of these guys are Tier 2B."], [2, "The stats are one thing, but what puts Kyrie over the top for most of those players for me is his clutch factor.

I believe westbrook or a harden would be detrimental to the Cavs, while a Lilliard, Lowry, Wall, CP3 or Steph would flourish in the Cavs.\n\nI feel Kyrie is asked to play two different roles be a facilitator or play shooting guard. Some gamed or quarters he passes the whole time. Other times, Lebron plays point so Kyrie is used as the shooter while Lebron gets doubled or calls the play. Kyrie would be dominant in any other team and for critics sake be a top 5 guard. Cavs have several good players so stats or their responsibility is diminished due to the talent. \n\nCurrently, we have the best point guards to ever play the game similar to how there were so many elite power forwards in late 90s 2000s ball.

Kyrie is hurt by the fact that Harden (a top 5 overall player) is now a de facto PG for the first time. (This is based on official position. He's run point from time to time before but he's never been officially listed as PG until this year as far as I know.)\n\n2. If you add Conley, Kemba, and Lowry to your list, you have a solid 10.  Looking at total BPM, Kyrie is 10th this season, with 9th OBPM and 8th in DBPM.  He's pretty clearly not top 6 if you look at the advanced statistics. \n\n3.  He is, however, 7th in usage, with most of these PGs handling the ball and being otherwise involved in a huge proportion of total team possessions. More possessions will almost always translate to higher BPM, especially when you're the go-to guy on your team. \n\n4.  I can't quantitatively rank with regards to which players specifically sacrifice personal stats due to team construction, team play style, position logjams, etc. but qualitatively, the argument could be made for Lowry, Conley and CP3 as the only players with less of a 'green light to get their stats' than Kyrie, and in the case of Conley and CP3 their team style actually compliments their styles. \n\n5. Not everybody gets to play with Lebron, KD, and Griffin, sure, but Kyrie, Curry, and CP3 on a different level with regards to team record. It's one thing to get awesome stats and win moderately, it's another thing to be the primary PG on a conference-leading team.  \n\n6. Back to subjectivity, Kyrie, subjectively, has some incredible handle. He finishes well around the basket, and he shoots well.  He may be slightly less efficient this season, but the sample size is extremely small right now.  Relative to other PGs (and regardless of rank) his deficiencies are not so material that he's OBVIOUSLY in any given tier. These things are nuanced and while I tend to think he's probably ranked 7th on my own very subjective list, he could easily fluctuate as high as fourth or fifth.  That said, I think if you could simply drag and drop all these PGs to other teams, you'd see very little differentiation from God-tier (RWB, Harden, Curry) and the rest of these guys, with the exception of CP3 who in my opinion is alone in his \"pass-first-past-his-prime-superstar-veteran\" tier, which is Tier 2A while the rest of these guys are Tier 2B.", "id": "daa5tds"}], [{"comment": "The stats are one thing, but what puts Kyrie over the top for most of those players for me is his clutch factor.

No one is going to deny that the Adams kick was one or both of those things, but I suspect there's a fair number of people around here willing to excuse some of the other stuff, which makes them a bit more likely to give him the benefit of the doubt than you seem to be.  This doesn't make you wrong or them wrong, but its a thing to keep in mind as you look at discussion on this topic.\n\nBut I think the real issue is: it kind of seems like LeBron didn't decide he got hit in the nuts until after he saw the replay.  When the initial contact was made, LeBron - who has been known to embellish contact - did not in any way react like he'd been hit in a sensitive area.  He could have easily been turning around based on something that Draymond had said rather than the contact, and if you look at the replay, while its clear that Draymond did make contact, its not clear how hard it was, and its very hard to tell if he actually hit James's LeBrons, or just hit butt or thigh.  So based on that alone, you kind of wonder if significant contact was made.\n\nAdditionally, if LeBron had said, at the time, right when the double foul was called \"hey, he punched me in the dick\", you kinda think the refs would have looked for it when they checked the replay, and handed out at least *some* sort of discipline, because if you know what you're looking for, its kind of hard to miss.  The fact that they did not assess a tech, or flagrant, or any other discipline whatsoever at the time kind of implies LeBron did not say anything to that effect, and you'd think he might have mentioned it if it happened.  Even in the post-game press conference, LeBron seemed more focused on things Draymond had said than Draymond's actions.  And then, suddenly, well after the event, it a clear and unambiguous dick punch for which he clearly should be suspended?\n\nLook, there's no disputing that Draymond's flailings were a bit reckless, and I get why people don't want to give him the benefit of the doubt.  And I don't think anyone would have batted an eyelash if they'd given him a tech, either at the time or after the fact.  But assessing a flagrant means the league office concluded unambiguously that Draymond punched LeBron in the dick, and the lack of conclusive evidence on replay, coupled with the lack of any reaction from LeBron until well after the event, makes that conclusion a bit debatable."], [1, "This place is less consistent than Soviet engineering.

No one is going to deny that the Adams kick was one or both of those things, but I suspect there's a fair number of people around here willing to excuse some of the other stuff, which makes them a bit more likely to give him the benefit of the doubt than you seem to be.  This doesn't make you wrong or them wrong, but its a thing to keep in mind as you look at discussion on this topic.\n\nBut I think the real issue is: it kind of seems like LeBron didn't decide he got hit in the nuts until after he saw the replay.  When the initial contact was made, LeBron - who has been known to embellish contact - did not in any way react like he'd been hit in a sensitive area.  He could have easily been turning around based on something that Draymond had said rather than the contact, and if you look at the replay, while its clear that Draymond did make contact, its not clear how hard it was, and its very hard to tell if he actually hit James's LeBrons, or just hit butt or thigh.  So based on that alone, you kind of wonder if significant contact was made.\n\nAdditionally, if LeBron had said, at the time, right when the double foul was called \"hey, he punched me in the dick\", you kinda think the refs would have looked for it when they checked the replay, and handed out at least *some* sort of discipline, because if you know what you're looking for, its kind of hard to miss.  The fact that they did not assess a tech, or flagrant, or any other discipline whatsoever at the time kind of implies LeBron did not say anything to that effect, and you'd think he might have mentioned it if it happened.  Even in the post-game press conference, LeBron seemed more focused on things Draymond had said than Draymond's actions.  And then, suddenly, well after the event, it a clear and unambiguous dick punch for which he clearly should be suspended?\n\nLook, there's no disputing that Draymond's flailings were a bit reckless, and I get why people don't want to give him the benefit of the doubt.  And I don't think anyone would have batted an eyelash if they'd given him a tech, either at the time or after the fact.  But assessing a flagrant means the league office concluded unambiguously that Draymond punched LeBron in the dick, and the lack of conclusive evidence on replay, coupled with the lack of any reaction from LeBron until well after the event, makes that conclusion a bit debatable.", "id": "d475cbz"}, {"comment": "What?

Its a technical foul.  And I'd argue that patting someone on the butt - even if that's not what you intended - is in a similar category.  Patting someone on the butt has never been a flagrant in the history of the league, nor should it be.\n\nAgain: I'm in no way arguing that Draymond shouldn't be disciplined.

My point is merely that if you're disciplining him for unnecessary contact - as a flagrant implies - its kind of important whether contact actually occurred.", "id": "d47gosv"}, {"comment": "See but that's the problem.

Bill's sports opinions have gone down hill the past couple of years, because analytics and other stats have killed a lot of silly \"bar argument\" type stuff I suppose he specialized in.\n\nIt doesn't bother me at all it isn't sportsy enough for some. I don't need to only read sports and follow sports, I like the balance between other current stuff that is going on.\n\nObviously, there just aren't writers with quite the depth of Zach Lowe, Bill Barnwell, Ben Lindbergh, or Wesley Morris at this site. And that certainly hurts it. Grantland did a lot of silly \"for fun\" stuff, specifically the \"shootarounds\" after big NBA nights, that I thought were great, but it probably helped by the fact it was shaped around having deep well thought out articles to balance it out as well.\n\nAnd that certainly goes for pop culture as well, most of their movie and TV reviews haven't quite been up to par with what Grantland offered. \n\nSo in that regard, I guess it disappoints me Bill didn't focus moreso on having more sports writers for \"smart fans\". With that said, Jason Concepcion, Sam Donsky, and Shea Serrano are all phenomenal troll writers, who have posted some of the funniest content I have seen on the internet the past few months. Their Game of Thrones coverage was mostly spot on as well.\n\nSome of their podcasts are ok. The Ryan/Greenwald pop culture one is good (although it is one of the few Ringer properties that is a direct facsimile of a Grantland item) and I just wish their NBA pods had more diversity. You can have your silly/goofy NBA show but also try to have one that focuses more on the sport from a serious perspective. \n\nThe hope is, it will get better. It certainly seems popular enough, they have written some great stuff and still are stacked with writers comparatively to most websites. It's an infant, and it certainly can grow, and they certainly have a lot of things going in the right direction enough to believe it will continue to grow and improve.\n\nBut my biggest worry is actually Bill himself. He is spending way too much time on a TV show no one cares about, his podcasts are really not appointment listening at this point (Joe House is the only NBA guest he has had in 6 months, and while I understand he lost all the ESPN people, the fact he can't book a single NBA guest or even use OTHER RINGER EMPLOYEES on his pod just boggles my mind.) but at least he will have his normal football routine (I assume) coming up shortly. And he isn't writing. And I am dubious that at this point I wouldn't roll my eyes at most of what he writes, but at least it would be something. \n\n"], [1, "well I used to constantly visit Grantland but I only visit the Ringer when I'm extremely bored, so yeah..."], [0, "It's a Bill Simmons website, not an ESPN website.

Grantland did a lot of silly \"for fun\" stuff, specifically the \"shootarounds\" after big NBA nights, that I thought were great, but it probably helped by the fact it was shaped around having deep well thought out articles to balance it out as well.\n\nAnd that certainly goes for pop culture as well, most of their movie and TV reviews haven't quite been up to par with what Grantland offered. \n\nSo in that regard, I guess it disappoints me Bill didn't focus moreso on having more sports writers for \"smart fans\". With that said, Jason Concepcion, Sam Donsky, and Shea Serrano are all phenomenal troll writers, who have posted some of the funniest content I have seen on the internet the past few months. Their Game of Thrones coverage was mostly spot on as well.\n\nSome of their podcasts are ok. The Ryan/Greenwald pop culture one is good (although it is one of the few Ringer properties that is a direct facsimile of a Grantland item) and I just wish their NBA pods had more diversity. You can have your silly/goofy NBA show but also try to have one that focuses more on the sport from a serious perspective. \n\nThe hope is, it will get better. It certainly seems popular enough, they have written some great stuff and still are stacked with writers comparatively to most websites. It's an infant, and it certainly can grow, and they certainly have a lot of things going in the right direction enough to believe it will continue to grow and improve.\n\nBut my biggest worry is actually Bill himself. He is spending way too much time on a TV show no one cares about, his podcasts are really not appointment listening at this point (Joe House is the only NBA guest he has had in 6 months, and while I understand he lost all the ESPN people, the fact he can't book a single NBA guest or even use OTHER RINGER EMPLOYEES on his pod just boggles my mind.) but at least he will have his normal football routine (I assume) coming up shortly. And he isn't writing. And I am dubious that at this point I wouldn't roll my eyes at most of what he writes, but at least it would be something. \n\n", "id": "d5cx0h3"}], [{"comment": "well I used to constantly visit Grantland but I only visit the Ringer when I'm extremely bored, so yeah...", "id": "d5d73s3"}], [{"comment": "It's a Bill Simmons website, not an ESPN website.

But the thing is, same can be said of lillard as you mentioned and Kyrie is younger and shown fucking amazement the last two seasons in terms of getting better. and could easily pass them both soon as I said above. and as it is now they are like .0001 apart in my book whereas the major difference is just leading on your own.\n\nI just have seen lillard and wall led teams make the playoffs, would klay be able to do it on his own?

I was just responding to the claim that Wall and Lillard have led teams to the playoffs while Kyrie has not.\n\n(It is interesting that you have Westbrook in \"group A\" even though he has never led a team to the playoffs either; he's always had KD = to Kyrie having LeBron). \n\nThe reality is that Wall never made the playoffs in his first three seasons either, because his team wasn't good enough (which is why Kyrie never led the Cavs to the playoffs, not because he's not a good enough leader). The Wizards made it when there was playoff talent around Wall -- not because Wall's leadership suddenly improved (just like the Cavs made it once Kyrie was surrounded by playoff talent). Of the three, Lillard came into the NBA in the best position because he had Aldridge from jump (remember, Lillard wasn't even the best player on his team the first time he went to the playoffs; Aldridge was). Once Kyrie had playoff talent around him, the Cavs lost in the NBA Finals.\n\n(If you're going to give Westbrook credit for being the second best player on a title contender, Kyrie deserves comparable credit for being the second best player on a NBA Champion.)\n\nTo me, the better measure is asking whether each had a meaningful role in helping his team maximize its potential. If so, they should all get comparable credit; if not, they should have have it count against them similarly. If the Cavs have the talent to be title contenders, Kyrie helping them win a title should count for at least as much as Wall or Lillard helping their respective teams make the playoffs (and even win a series).

It also doesn't help you trying to get a job in the same field when the first thing that comes up when you search on your name is you saying something about your boss.\n\nHinkie didn't have time? He had 3 drafts and the first guy he picked (MCW) was sent packing. He also drafted a draft and stash (Saric), 2 centers who weren't able to play their first year (JE and Nerlens) and another who didn't fit their play style (Okafor). He essentially drafted guys on the phrase \"when they're healthy they'll be good,\" although Noel is a monster on D he and Okafor can't play together and even in the best case scenario, what's the end rotation? Which one of those 3 comes off the bench? And if one of them is truly good, what does that make one of the other, trade bait. \n\nIt was well known what Hinkie's plan was when he was hired. He was going to create a cheap team where he could flip guys for assets, waive guys when they cost more then was acceptable. All of these things Taken at their word are fine, but think of the effect it has. Essentially, Hinkie would keep bringing in guys on the cheap, offer them crap contracts and inflate their value looking for a sucker. If you're a player you might be more inclined to work on some individual skills (proving outside range) instead of team play, because essentially the guy at the top has no idea what the finished product of this team is because he's banking on a superstar in the draft (some 19-20 year old) to unite the team or, hoping he pulls a Harden deal.

There has to be some individual \"prior\" that lowers Klay's number so much, but it's not that easy to guess what. \n\nComparing different SGs, I think it's probably the number of steals in big part. Obviously, a lot of the best \"short\" defenders are the ones who also have a lot of steals. It could be a big part in ESPN's prior. What confirms my guess: the SG leaders of DRPM are the ones with the most steals - Tony Allen and Randae Hollis-Jefferson. Manu Ginobili is also very high, 4th, separated by Andre Roberson, who has a little less steals, but obviously enormous +/- numbers.

Are we discussing putting the actual Wilt Chamberlain, born in 1936, in a time machine and asking him to compete against athletes from the 80s or the current day? Or are we talking about an alternate universe Wilt Chamberlain, born with all his physical and mental attributes, but in a different era? It makes a **big** difference.\n\nIf Wilt Chamberlain had been born in the 1980s and spent the last 20 years competing against the guys who would be his peers today, with all the benefits of modern training, sports science, and so forth combined with his natural aptitude and frame, it's entirely possible he'd be one of the greatest players of all time (again, sort of). Hell, maybe he'd even be a gigantic wing player like Kevin Durant or what appears might happen with Shaq's son Shareef.\n\nThe problem is, the only way to make these comparisons 'fair' is to somehow give Wilt access to all the benefits today's players have access to, and since you can't the whole scenario is imaginary. Hypothetical modern Wilt can be anything you want him to be, so what's the point?\n\nAt least the actual Wilt Chamberlain has a record you can point to. It's not apples to apples but it's something. However, if you put that 1960s Wilt in a time machine and dropped him into today's NBA he could hang, he might even be great, but he wouldn't be dominant. The athleticism required to compete at the highest levels has increased so dramatically in the last 50 years that many of the advantages he had then partially or entirely neutralized. Take a look at this [highlight reel of Wilt's dunks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHh-Kh5UxI4). Wilt is estimated as having had a standing reach of 9-6\u2014an inch more than Shaq and two or three more than Dwight\u2014and he's barely getting above the rim. Does anyone honestly watch that video and think players like DeAndre, Dwight, Tyson Chandler (not to mention Shaq, Hakeem, Alonzo, Dikembe, etc.) would be incapable of defending those plays?\n\n60s Wilt's speed/agility is an especially interesting aspect of this discussion as his first love was track and field, and he competed in numerous events at the high school and collegiate levels. Objective comparisons are much more plausible in that sport, keeping in mind the caveat above about modern sports science practices. Once again, Wilt was dominant at the time, but his reported personal records (11 sec 100m, 49 sec 400m, 10'6\" high jump) wouldn't have won him a single event at last year's California *High School* Championships. And this is slender, young Wilt we're talking about. The Wilt Chamberlain who averaged 50 and 25 in the early 60's had already begun to put on weight, and the 76ers/Lakers Wilt you most likely picture in your mind was significantly heavier and slower than he was as a young man.\n\nThe one aspect of 60s Wilt's athleticism that I believe would translate to today's game is his strength. He is almost indisputably the strongest person to have played in the NBA, and the list of challengers may be [only Shaq](http://i.imgur.com/Ij7HJtd.jpg). Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, who obviously was himself and spent time over the years with many of the greatest power lifters of all time, [recalls Wilt as being one of the strongest people he ever encountered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STXbuXGPdoY).\n\nLet's turn the hypothetical on it's head. Imagine that every player in the history of the NBA were 21 years old and being drafted this June. All of them reap the benefits of modern training and sports science, and one would imagine certain intangibles (intensity, discipline, soft skills/leadership) translate across eras. On the other hand, guys who happened to be the fastest or the best leapers of their time probably see the value of those traits diminish, likewise players who happened to be the first to play a style that the league later adjusted to (like Dirk as an outside shooting 7-footer) probably have less of an impact. Obviously, everyone has to contend with how their skills and attributes translate to the rules and style of play of NBA basketball in 2016.\n\n1. We would need about 60 expansion teams to accommodate all that talent.\n2. Next year's NBA season would be the most amazing thing ever.\n3. Wilt would undoubtedly be taken in the first round (top 90), but if you wanted a big as your first pick I think you'd have to at least consider taking Kareem, Russell, Shaq or Olajuwon over Wilt, not to mention David Robinson, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Anthony Davis, Karl-Anthony Towns, as well as some interesting hypotheticals like healthy versions of Ralph Sampson or Bill Walton.\n4. I think it's interesting to think about how that draft would play out, I could easily see at least the top 5 picks being made with every center still available."], [10, ">  I think we not only ignore that it was much more difficult to play offense back then\n\nI'm curious, why do you think that?

If you swap Wilt and Russell, it seems like the Celtics would have about the same number of rings.\n\nOverall it kind of reminds me of Lebron pre-Decision, if he'd stayed with the Cavs and kept getting eliminated by the Celtics, Spurs or Warriors every year. \n"], [4, "**Here's why Wilt Chamberlain isn't in my top ten All-Time**\n****\n**Warriors**\n\n* '60 - Lost 4-2 in the Conference Finals\n* '61 - Lost 3-0 in the First Round\n* '62 - Lost 4-3 in the Conference Finals\n* '63 - Lost 3-2 in the First Round\n* '64 - Lost 4-1 in the Finals\n\n**76ers**\n\n* '65 - Lost 4-3 in the Conference Finals\n* '66 - Lost 4-1 in the Conference Finals\n* '67 - **Won 4-2 in the Finals**\n* '68 - Lost 4-3 in the Conference Finals\n\n**Lakers**\n\n* '69 - Lost 4-2 in the Finals\n* '70 - Lost 4-3 in the Finals\n* '71 - Lost 4-1 in the Conference Finals\n* '72 - **Won 4-1 in the Finals**\n* '73 - Lost 4-1 in the Finals\n\nListen, I'm with you on the 'out of his control' issues that people are blaming him for.

Is Lebron in the top ten if he never wins another? probably so, but most likely 6-7 range rather than 3,4,5.\n\nThe fact is that Wilt rarely won. His accomplishments were incredible, but even today if you put Kevin Durant on the Kings and set him on chucker-mode, averaging 40+ seems pretty possible to me when he doesn't try and win, only to score.\n\nI'll agree wholeheartedly that Wilt was one of the greatest athletes that ever lived. But he should've dominated every single game. How do you lose if you're that good? And with the exceptions of Russell, West, Robertson, and a little later Kareem, there wasn't a player in his stratosphere around him.

Hell, maybe he'd even be a gigantic wing player like Kevin Durant or what appears might happen with Shaq's son Shareef.\n\nThe problem is, the only way to make these comparisons 'fair' is to somehow give Wilt access to all the benefits today's players have access to, and since you can't the whole scenario is imaginary. Hypothetical modern Wilt can be anything you want him to be, so what's the point?\n\nAt least the actual Wilt Chamberlain has a record you can point to. It's not apples to apples but it's something. However, if you put that 1960s Wilt in a time machine and dropped him into today's NBA he could hang, he might even be great, but he wouldn't be dominant. The athleticism required to compete at the highest levels has increased so dramatically in the last 50 years that many of the advantages he had then partially or entirely neutralized. Take a look at this [highlight reel of Wilt's dunks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHh-Kh5UxI4). Wilt is estimated as having had a standing reach of 9-6\u2014an inch more than Shaq and two or three more than Dwight\u2014and he's barely getting above the rim. Does anyone honestly watch that video and think players like DeAndre, Dwight, Tyson Chandler (not to mention Shaq, Hakeem, Alonzo, Dikembe, etc.) would be incapable of defending those plays?\n\n60s Wilt's speed/agility is an especially interesting aspect of this discussion as his first love was track and field, and he competed in numerous events at the high school and collegiate levels. Objective comparisons are much more plausible in that sport, keeping in mind the caveat above about modern sports science practices. Once again, Wilt was dominant at the time, but his reported personal records (11 sec 100m, 49 sec 400m, 10'6\" high jump) wouldn't have won him a single event at last year's California *High School* Championships. And this is slender, young Wilt we're talking about. The Wilt Chamberlain who averaged 50 and 25 in the early 60's had already begun to put on weight, and the 76ers/Lakers Wilt you most likely picture in your mind was significantly heavier and slower than he was as a young man.\n\nThe one aspect of 60s Wilt's athleticism that I believe would translate to today's game is his strength. He is almost indisputably the strongest person to have played in the NBA, and the list of challengers may be [only Shaq](http://i.imgur.com/Ij7HJtd.jpg). Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, who obviously was himself and spent time over the years with many of the greatest power lifters of all time, [recalls Wilt as being one of the strongest people he ever encountered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STXbuXGPdoY).\n\nLet's turn the hypothetical on it's head. Imagine that every player in the history of the NBA were 21 years old and being drafted this June. All of them reap the benefits of modern training and sports science, and one would imagine certain intangibles (intensity, discipline, soft skills/leadership) translate across eras. On the other hand, guys who happened to be the fastest or the best leapers of their time probably see the value of those traits diminish, likewise players who happened to be the first to play a style that the league later adjusted to (like Dirk as an outside shooting 7-footer) probably have less of an impact. Obviously, everyone has to contend with how their skills and attributes translate to the rules and style of play of NBA basketball in 2016.\n\n1. We would need about 60 expansion teams to accommodate all that talent.\n2. Next year's NBA season would be the most amazing thing ever.\n3. Wilt would undoubtedly be taken in the first round (top 90), but if you wanted a big as your first pick I think you'd have to at least consider taking Kareem, Russell, Shaq or Olajuwon over Wilt, not to mention David Robinson, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Anthony Davis, Karl-Anthony Towns, as well as some interesting hypotheticals like healthy versions of Ralph Sampson or Bill Walton.\n4.

Here in the real world, KAT doesn't even turn 21 until November, and he's already demonstrated a variety of skills Wilt never got close to having at any point in his career. And all of these guys are going to be playing in a 2016-17 Super NBA, which means more or less a modern playstyle. I think you absolutely have to consider taking KAT over Wilt, given the importance of outside shooting and perimeter P&R defense. Your alternative is banking on Wilt being just as effective against peak Russell, Unseld, Abdul-Jabbar, Walton, Sampson, Olajuwon, Robinson, Mutombo, Mourning, Shaq, Yao, Duncan,  Garnett, et. al as he was against all that elite big man talent playing in the 1960s NBA.", "id": "d5j7azu"}, {"comment": "The only skill he has that wilt didn't was a better mid range jumper.

Draymond may never have to do as much as Larry had to, because he's got such a deep bench and a plethora talent around him. But I like Draymond Green and I like the fire he stirs.

LeBron, OTOH, can do really accurate no-look passes and has better court vision/awareness when it comes to finding the open player.\n  \nWhat bothers me is that people describe LeBron's passing as Magic-esque, and his passing is elite. I don't think of it as elite. Elite to me is CP3, Nash, Kidd. I think of LeBron's passing as the same level as Chris Webber and Lamar Odom.\n  \nWhat might be the case is that LeBron's certainly capable of making the right pass 99% of the time, but nothing about his passing screams unique, amazing, or superior to me consistently. Rondo, for example, is someone that really leaves me speechless when it comes to passing.\n  \nUnrelated but, I have no shame that I've always rooted against LeBron so that Kobe's legacy can seem better. But LeBron's done wonderfully to bring a championship to Cleveland. However, I think not enough credit goes to Kyrie, who on multiple occasions closed out those games when LeBron was too tired to (for good reason).\n  \ntl;dr LeBron is better, but the gap is a lot closer to me than what other people seem to believe. Their passing styles are also different.", "id": "d5e0q8q"}, {"comment": "Shouldn't being able to make the right pass 99% of the time be considered elite passing though?

Meyers Leonard is another player who would likely fare well under this rubric.

It's true, Leonard doesn't neccisarily excel in the same ways as your typical NBA big man (back to the basket post game, rebounding, blocks, etc) and he has trouble with a lot of defensive matchups (although it must be said, as a man to man post defender against traditional big centers, i.e. Cousins, M Gasol, Howard, etc he is extremely underrated), but as a stretch big (esp as a 5) he has a measurable effect on the spacing and the opposing team's ability to play certain types of defense. He was hobbled last season but even then, and more so the season before, Meyers was able to be active setting and using screens, pulling his big defender out of the paint and making them choose between protecting the rim or sticking to their man. Either choice opens up a gaping hole for the Blazers offense to penetrate, either with our guards cutting and driving or Meyers getting an open look from 3.

Ray Allen for his career (well, unfortunately bball ref only goes back to 2000) **shot 63% from 0-2ft, 40% from 3-10ft, 44.4% from 10-15ft, 43.6% from 16<3, and 40.3% from three**.

If a player is shooting lights out from every zone on the floor, including damn near 50% on the shots you supposedly WANT him to take, there's really nothing you can do to stop him offensively. \n\nCompare to Lavine: for his career he's shooting **69.2% from 0-2ft, 33.7% from 3-10ft, 31% from 10-15ft, 37.5% from 16<3, 37.8% from three**. He's all layups and threes, he has no in-between skill whatsoever if defenses take away his primary scoring areas. You can live with Lavine taking the midrange shot, whereas with Allen he would kill you from midrange just as bad as anywhere else. \n\nThere's still a chance for Lavine to develop more skill in his scoring beneath the arc, but the chances of him approaching the levels of one of the top 3 most proficient midrange shooters of all time, doesn't seem likely.

And before we get into the details of the trade let's just acknowledge the fact that GarPax are the reason Derrick and Joakim don't want to play for us anymore. We wouldn't be in a position where we are forced to trade Derrick if it wasn't for them. We traded Derrick because we knew he wouldn't re-sign, and we got a replacement center for Joakim because we know he's not coming back either. If we had a competent front office, we would have had a strong chance of re-signing Derrick and Joakim to reasonable deals. And I would take that any day of the week over Jerian Grant and Robin Lopez. But unfortunately, we do not have a competant front office, and this is not the situation. \n\nAs far as the trade itself, I don't think we got anything of real value. I don't think Grant will be good. I was a little quick to call RoLo overpaid, because it's kind of hard to tell with the new cap. He's not overpaid, but at the same time if we're going to do a rebuild around Jimmy I'd rather just keep the flexibility and either draft another big guy or sign one for cheap and keep Felicio as the backup. Instead of having 28 year old Robin Lopez on a team that's supposedly trying to get more young and athletic according to Gar Forman.

Apart from turnovers and free throws, he made a big jump from the first 28 games to the last 54. There's no reason to think that this year won't be the same.\n\n> Team doing bad.\n\nHarden does not play all 5 positions. Harden is not responsible for the whole team shooting abysmally from everywhere the first third of the season. He is not responsible for injuries causing Trevor Ariza to start at the 4. The first few weeks of the season, if Harden didn't have a monster game, the Rockets lost, which shows how reliant they were on him.\n\n> Turnovers.\n\nTOV% is pretty much unchanged year-over-year. He is a high usage player and thus he will turn the ball over more.\n\n> Not being a good leader.\n\nThis is subjective. You have no idea how Harden leads behind-the-scenes. I could just as easily claim that without Harden in the locker room, this team would have already fallen apart with players looking for trades. Not a peep has come out of players wanting to be traded or moved or disgruntled. All the crap you've read is fabrication from very questionable sources that people love eating up because it is shitting on the Rockets (best example of this is the Sheridan article).\n\n> Fucking up the offense by being extremely ball dominant.\n\nNo one else on the team can create for themselves. I don't know if you noticed but we don't have a Gregg Popovich designing our offense. The Rockets are many years into this style of offense and it's clear that it is what Morey wants.

A few more points to the above . . . \n\n2 (b) - Kareem was the ultimate offensive safety valve, if the grab-and-go did not work, they had a reliable offensive weapon (high-percentage shot), even with the shot clock winding down.  You could build your team around a fast-break because Kareem was an effective half-court offense all by himself.  (Note: this is sort of the inverse of Lebron, who is effectively a fast-break offense all by himself).\n\n3 - One of the reasons Kareem's statistical productivity went down in the mid-80s was because there was plenty of other fire-power on the team.  You had Jamaal Wilkes, Bob McAdoo (both HOF-ers), Norm Nixon (who started ahead of Magic for some time) among others who were excellent half-court players, all of whom dragged down each others' offensive stats.\n\n\n4 - Defensive statistics don't really do a good job of telling the story either.  Kareem was the all-time blocks leader (until Hakeem passed him, who is another of my favorites), but blocks were not a stat that was kept by the NBA until several years after his career started.  He didn't have tremendous rebounding numbers after his \"peak\" because he always was paired with good rebounding role players - like AC Green, Kurt Rambis, Mitch Kupchak, and a pretty good set of rebounding guards (like Magic).  (A digression - just from looking at the stats, the Showtime Lakers don't look like a very good rebounding team as a whole.  However, they quite good when you consider how high their shooting percentage was - well above 50%.  There simply were not a lot of opportunities for offensive rebounds).\n\n4(c) - Furthermore in the \"stats don't tell the whole story\" category -  Unless your are Shaq, most offensive-post players are not in a good position to rebound the ball if they were the ones taking the shot.  This is especially true with a hook, where you are giving up offensive rebounding position by turning sideways into your shot.  Again, this is why the team usually paired Kareem with a rebounding forward (or three).  This is the same reason Hakeem worked so well with Otis Thorpe, until the league moved the three point line in and everyone ran behind the arc.  (Another digression, in the early years before he had refined his post-game, Akeem played the rebounding/weak-side role for Ralph Samson who played in the high and low post).\n\n5 - For better-or-worse, Kareem's statistics declined because the Lakers had the luxury of resting him.  As the 80s team matured, Kareem averaged just 30-35 minutes a game.  A team with less talent probably would have relied on him more.  The team had a lot of blow-out wins (games Chick Hearn would \"put in the refrigerator by the mid-3rd quarter), but that depressed gaudy stats.  The Lakers' Luxury went so far as bringing in another Overall #1 Pick, Mychael Thompson, to serve as Kareem's backup (and play along-side him against the twin-tower Chief-McHale Celtics) in '86.  Regardless, \"Cap\" was always in the crunch time, which is why his minutes went up (to 35+ a game) in the playoffs.  (Another digression - the Lakers' always used to get slack from the media for resting players for whole games before the playoffs, especially Magic.  It was Pre-Popovich, but most seem to laud this practice now).\n\nTLDR: The Lakers had an all-time team where everyone's stats were suppressed; Kareem's statistical productivity declined in part because of specific strategies and personnel that the Lakers' applied to extend his career and keep him fresh for important games; the Lakers still relied on KAJ a great deal even at an advancing age.\n edit: formatting/numbering", "id": "d76yn9a"}, {"comment": "Wow, this is some really interesting tactical analysis. Thank you. I never watched complete games of Showtime, let alone chronicling their development over the years. I just watched clips of them on Youtube, and did some number crunching.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI definitely noticed the minutes and rebounding decline, but I chalked it up more to his age FORCING them to rest him, rather than their dominance affording them the luxury.

People say Mike D was the inventor of the modern offense, but in many ways, Magic Johnson was.  And the beauty of those Lakers teams was, if the other team beat you down the court and took away your steam, you could just dump the ball to Kareem.  That swing left, shoot right sky hook had a release point that was nearly ten feet high, and he had his entire body and the half the length of his right arm, between you and the ball.

I'm not saying he wasn't dominant, nor that the skyhook wasn't deadly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm just pointing out he didn't do much winning. He won like 3 or 4 championships as a good player. He picked up another 2 or 3 as a crappy, totally replaceable backup.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYes, NO ONE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS ALONE. LeBron and Jordan both got lambasted for not being able to, and they were basically gods from the get-go. (I made that point in there somewhere, sorry if it's hard to notice.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut Kareem barely contributed for at least his last two rings. He was washed-up and should've just stepped aside. The Lakers could have easily replaced his production at that point, they probably would have been even better. How differently would he be perceived if he'd won 4 titles in 17 seasons, rather than 6 in 20?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd yeah, in the first 10 years of his career, when he was actually a dominant MVP-caliber force, he'd only won a single championship and made it to one other Finals.

Like a full decade and a half of LeBron's frustrating struggles in Cleveland before he left?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA 6-time MVP with only 2 rings? Even if it's totally unfair, wouldn't that be perceived as an embarrassment and underachievement rather than an accomplishment? Wouldn't he be seen as an even bigger disappointment than Wilt, or Karl Malone, or Barkley?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat was my point. We can separate \"talent\" from \"legacy\".

Then again, if there is a lineup that can sweep these Warriors: it's Rodman at C, Kukoc at PF, Pippen and MJ as wings and Harper/Kerr as the point. They do matchup well. However it's so difficult to play lockdown D on a guy like Klay who is not iso heavy and doesn't really create his own shot often. He's bound to escape MJ off a screen or get open because MJ would play help defense every now and then instinctively as well. Also Curry's bound to pass 20 points in a game or two, and even if he doesn't, Pippen also needs to hold him around 6 or 7 assists at most. I still think the Warriors have a better bench, legends and stars can argue which era's were better, but one thing is for certain, role players are much better today than ever. Both Curry and Klay can have off nights, but the rest of the team can still score enough to get a W to avoid that sweep. \n\nHere's my take: If the Dubs win 5 out of their last 6, they get home court. If they have home court, I'd say they even have a shot at beating the '96 Bulls if it's today's rules. Bulls definitely win even without home court if the 3pt line is shorter and hand-checking is allowed. If the Bulls have home court, they can probably sweep either way, but I still think the Warriors can steal at least two games if Seattle did.

That's 3 of some of the greatest defenders of all time + Harper who was a damn good defender himself.  Steph has never faced anything close to that sort of defensive pressure.  If it's just Harper on him (again, a damn good defender in his own right), which would be the normal match up, and he forces Steph to drive and kick... then he has to worry about 2 passing lane master thieves in Pippen in Jordan to worry about - at the same time.  Rodman is a black hole of his own.  It could potentially become an easy 2 the other way for the Bulls with their fast break game.\n\nIf that Bulls team *wanted* to individually shut your ass down, then they were shutting your ass down - though they rarely ever needed to resort to focusing their defensive pressure to that extent.\n\nWhen it comes to the bench the Warriors take it, but the Bulls would match up so well against what the Warriors want to do I think it makes up for it.\n\nI don't know about a sweep but I'm definitely going with the Bulls here.  In both eras assuming their physical playstyle would be toned down for today's era so they don't foul excessively.  If it was 90's rules with no zone defense, a lot more physical play and hand-checking allowed, then yeah, lol I could see a sweep.

However it's so difficult to play lockdown D on a guy like Klay who is not iso heavy and doesn't really create his own shot often. He's bound to escape MJ off a screen or get open because MJ would play help defense every now and then instinctively as well. Also Curry's bound to pass 20 points in a game or two, and even if he doesn't, Pippen also needs to hold him around 6 or 7 assists at most. I still think the Warriors have a better bench, legends and stars can argue which era's were better, but one thing is for certain, role players are much better today than ever. Both Curry and Klay can have off nights, but the rest of the team can still score enough to get a W to avoid that sweep. \n\nHere's my take: If the Dubs win 5 out of their last 6, they get home court. If they have home court, I'd say they even have a shot at beating the '96 Bulls if it's today's rules. Bulls definitely win even without home court if the 3pt line is shorter and hand-checking is allowed.

He's going to eat Klay's lunch on both sides of the court then pour salt in the wound by talking major shit while he's doing it.\n\nI'm taking Rodman all day in a match up against Green.\n\nBetween Harper, Jordan, Pippen and occasionally Rodman (might be the best in history at guarding 1-5) switching on Steph I like the chances of them bothering the shit out of him.  That's 3 of some of the greatest defenders of all time + Harper who was a damn good defender himself.  Steph has never faced anything close to that sort of defensive pressure.  If it's just Harper on him (again, a damn good defender in his own right), which would be the normal match up, and he forces Steph to drive and kick... then he has to worry about 2 passing lane master thieves in Pippen in Jordan to worry about - at the same time.  Rodman is a black hole of his own.  It could potentially become an easy 2 the other way for the Bulls with their fast break game.\n\nIf that Bulls team *wanted* to individually shut your ass down, then they were shutting your ass down - though they rarely ever needed to resort to focusing their defensive pressure to that extent.\n\nWhen it comes to the bench the Warriors take it, but the Bulls would match up so well against what the Warriors want to do I think it makes up for it.\n\nI don't know about a sweep but I'm definitely going with the Bulls here.

It is this model he's taking, with his inimitable talents, to the Golden State Warriors this fall, leaving behind **the team he built from splinters into a perennial title contender,** the Oklahoma City Thunder. In so doing, he's knowingly placed in jeopardy his richly earned brand as the game's kindest star, opening himself up to a **barrage of criticism usually lobbed by alt-right trolls.** And why all this hatred for a guy who did things right, **carried a franchise on his back for nine years while it tried to win a championship on the cheap?** Because, for the first time in his life, Durant prioritized himself, chose to pursue his own joy, not his sense of obligation to millions of strangers.\n\nTwo unnecessary shots at OKC plus a bizarre reference to the alt-right. OKC wasn't trying to win a championship on the cheap. OKC was trying to avoid the punitive repeater luxury tax when KD and Westbrook got their new deals. This topic has been beaten into the ground. \n\n> Since Durant quit Oklahoma at the beginning of July, all anyone had wanted to ask him was why he'd ditched his boys there for the squad of supervillains on Golden State. **He'd been called everything but a radical Muslim by otherwise mannerly Oklahomans,** their presumption being that Durant was basket-hanging in pursuit of a ring. That seemed, to put it kindly, ungrateful.\n\nAgain, more shots at OKC. \n\n> And he held his tongue when, summer after summer, the Thunder declined to add a proven third option \u2013 think Ray Allen in Boston, or Love in Cleveland. \"Where other teams went out and got that veteran guy, we kept getting younger,\" he says with a sigh, pushing around a sausage link with his fork. **Apparently it's exhausting, even in memory, to carry a team on your back.**\n\nLet me break out the world's smallest violin. How can Durant claim he carried that team on his back when he had Westbrook next to him? \n\n> Though he's too shrewd to say it, that series of betrayals eventually broke his heart. \"For nine years, he refused to speak a word against that team \u2013 he loved those guys and that city,\" says his mom, Wanda Durant, who's been his best friend and confidante since he started his b-ball journey at the age of eight. \"But this summer he said, 'Mama, I can't do it anymore. They're not in this thing with me, we're not together like we were \u2013 I feel like I need something different.'\u2009\" These past four years, he'd gamely shouldered the burden of heading a one-horse, two-star franchise, going into battle with just his point guard, Russell Westbrook, as a dependable second scorer. \n\nGood thing I broke out that violin, it's getting a ton of work. \n\n> He acquitted himself better in Game Seven, but Westbrook was strictly on fumes then.\n\nAh, so losing the Warriors series was Westbrook's fault. Glad we got that cleared up. \n\n> Try as it might with draft picks and trades, management there was never going to fix what it had broken with the Harden deal. \n\nOKC had their best team ever the year after the Harden deal, and they reached an even higher level in the playoffs last season. C'mon. \n\n> One team particularly drew his notice: the ball-don't-stop, breakneck-tempo, blowout-happy Warriors. *These dudes play just like I do*, he thought. *They see the floor the way I see it*.\n\nWhat? Durant was every bit the ball-stopper Westbrook was during his time in OKC. He may like the way Golden State plays, but let's not act like he wasn't a core part of the ball stagnancy problem in OKC. He wasn't out there trying to play Warriors ball. \n\n> There, he could \"set picks and get hockey assists,\" the small-ball things he'd likely never get to do as long as he played with Westbrook. \"It's an open secret that the fun had stopped there and it was never going to flow with Russell,\" says a highly placed source in the league. \"Russell's a my-turn, your-turn kind of guy, and don't think defenders don't know that. When Russ had the ball, KD's guy would leave him to go and help guard Russ.\"\n\nIt's fucking disgraceful how KD's camp is determined to throw Westbrook under the bus. \n\n> As close as people presumed he and Westbrook had been, they were never much more than work friends, he says.\n\nBull fucking shit. That's a man KD has described as a \"brother\" on numerous occasions, \"closer than family\". \"Work friends\"? Sure. \n\n> All his life, he'd been walking alone, a party of one in the desert. Now, at last, his tribe called out to him. Who among us could have said no?\n\n...\n\n> He texted Westbrook the news, but didn't call him \u2013 they hadn't really talked through the process. Asked why, Durant gives a shrug. They'd had those years together, fought as hard as two men can when they're outnumbered. Sometimes, when it ends, you let the silence speak; words just don't seem adequate, for better or worse.\n\nThey didn't really talk throughout the process? We know that's not true.

Right after they finally made the finals and got things rolling, injuries constantly set them back in the playoffs. Literally every series for the next few seasons, one of the crucial pieces (Ibaka, Westbrook, Durant), got hurt. In any of those seasons they were going to have a much easier time in getting to the finals and possibly winning them. By the time everything got put together in 2016, they had to go through the 67 wins Spurs and 73 wins Warriors and unfortunately KD's free agency popped up right after that. Imagine if KD had one more year left on his contract at this point in time; that extra shot at redemption might have changed the whole scope of things.\n\nBeyond that I think OKC made some great moves to support KD but, again, in 2016, the league was dominated by TEAMS. It's not just that there were 3-4 stars on a team (which OKC arguably had with Ibaka, Durant and WB, with Ibaka being a little further off than the rest), it's that the role players were making all the difference. After dealing with Curry, Lebron, Klay and Kyrie you have to go through savvy vets like Iggy, Barbosa, Livingston, Frye and Jefferson. To top it all off you have dudes like Thompson eating rebounds. If KD or WB sit, no one's even going to throw a nice pass to Kanter/Adams and you have to pray that Singler or Morrow don't get eaten alive on defense. That's entirely what KD meant when he said the team was getting younger I'm sure; specifically in 2016, there were no vet guys (like Perkins, Fisher) around for stability and promising guys like Payne, Waiters, etc. were just too young to compete with ridiculously experienced teams like the Spurs and Warriors. \n\nI also cannot imagine how frustrating it is to play with WB for 9 years in a row and I think that is a huge factor in why KD left. WB is a great player and has grown each and every year in the league, but there's no way KD and WB were meant to function together. They got to 3-1 playing at their best possible level and lost that lead because it simply was not sustainable; WB needs dudes who are more pure off-ball players and KD is simply too good to wait on the wing while WB drives and kicks. They just need different teams at the end of the day. \n\nLastly I'm just happy for KD. In spite of all the shit going on it seems like he's a lot more at peace with everything than he used to be, from previous interviews. Sure he might have had a role in losing that 3-1, but at the end of the day I understand his decision. It might not be the decision that every NBA star would've made in the exact same circumstances, but it's the decision that makes KD happy and in the end everybody's just trying to make life better for themselves.\n\n"], [-3, "I actually really enjoyed the article, but obviously I'm biased.

It is this model he's taking, with his inimitable talents, to the Golden State Warriors this fall, leaving behind **the team he built from splinters into a perennial title contender,** the Oklahoma City Thunder. In so doing, he's knowingly placed in jeopardy his richly earned brand as the game's kindest star, opening himself up to a **barrage of criticism usually lobbed by alt-right trolls.** And why all this hatred for a guy who did things right, **carried a franchise on his back for nine years while it tried to win a championship on the cheap?** Because, for the first time in his life, Durant prioritized himself, chose to pursue his own joy, not his sense of obligation to millions of strangers.\n\nTwo unnecessary shots at OKC plus a bizarre reference to the alt-right. OKC wasn't trying to win a championship on the cheap. OKC was trying to avoid the punitive repeater luxury tax when KD and Westbrook got their new deals. This topic has been beaten into the ground. \n\n> Since Durant quit Oklahoma at the beginning of July, all anyone had wanted to ask him was why he'd ditched his boys there for the squad of supervillains on Golden State. **He'd been called everything but a radical Muslim by otherwise mannerly Oklahomans,** their presumption being that Durant was basket-hanging in pursuit of a ring. That seemed, to put it kindly, ungrateful.\n\nAgain, more shots at OKC. \n\n> And he held his tongue when, summer after summer, the Thunder declined to add a proven third option \u2013 think Ray Allen in Boston, or Love in Cleveland. \"Where other teams went out and got that veteran guy, we kept getting younger,\" he says with a sigh, pushing around a sausage link with his fork. **Apparently it's exhausting, even in memory, to carry a team on your back.**\n\nLet me break out the world's smallest violin. How can Durant claim he carried that team on his back when he had Westbrook next to him? \n\n> Though he's too shrewd to say it, that series of betrayals eventually broke his heart. \"For nine years, he refused to speak a word against that team \u2013 he loved those guys and that city,\" says his mom, Wanda Durant, who's been his best friend and confidante since he started his b-ball journey at the age of eight. \"But this summer he said, 'Mama, I can't do it anymore. They're not in this thing with me, we're not together like we were \u2013 I feel like I need something different.'\u2009\" These past four years, he'd gamely shouldered the burden of heading a one-horse, two-star franchise, going into battle with just his point guard, Russell Westbrook, as a dependable second scorer. \n\nGood thing I broke out that violin, it's getting a ton of work. \n\n> He acquitted himself better in Game Seven, but Westbrook was strictly on fumes then.\n\nAh, so losing the Warriors series was Westbrook's fault. Glad we got that cleared up. \n\n> Try as it might with draft picks and trades, management there was never going to fix what it had broken with the Harden deal. \n\nOKC had their best team ever the year after the Harden deal, and they reached an even higher level in the playoffs last season. C'mon. \n\n> One team particularly drew his notice: the ball-don't-stop, breakneck-tempo, blowout-happy Warriors. *These dudes play just like I do*, he thought. *They see the floor the way I see it*.\n\nWhat? Durant was every bit the ball-stopper Westbrook was during his time in OKC. He may like the way Golden State plays, but let's not act like he wasn't a core part of the ball stagnancy problem in OKC. He wasn't out there trying to play Warriors ball. \n\n> There, he could \"set picks and get hockey assists,\" the small-ball things he'd likely never get to do as long as he played with Westbrook. \"It's an open secret that the fun had stopped there and it was never going to flow with Russell,\" says a highly placed source in the league. \"Russell's a my-turn, your-turn kind of guy, and don't think defenders don't know that. When Russ had the ball, KD's guy would leave him to go and help guard Russ.\"\n\nIt's fucking disgraceful how KD's camp is determined to throw Westbrook under the bus. \n\n> As close as people presumed he and Westbrook had been, they were never much more than work friends, he says.\n\nBull fucking shit. That's a man KD has described as a \"brother\" on numerous occasions, \"closer than family\". \"Work friends\"? Sure. \n\n> All his life, he'd been walking alone, a party of one in the desert. Now, at last, his tribe called out to him. Who among us could have said no?\n\n...\n\n> He texted Westbrook the news, but didn't call him \u2013 they hadn't really talked through the process. Asked why, Durant gives a shrug. They'd had those years together, fought as hard as two men can when they're outnumbered. Sometimes, when it ends, you let the silence speak; words just don't seem adequate, for better or worse.\n\nThey didn't really talk throughout the process? We know that's not true.

Right after they finally made the finals and got things rolling, injuries constantly set them back in the playoffs. Literally every series for the next few seasons, one of the crucial pieces (Ibaka, Westbrook, Durant), got hurt. In any of those seasons they were going to have a much easier time in getting to the finals and possibly winning them. By the time everything got put together in 2016, they had to go through the 67 wins Spurs and 73 wins Warriors and unfortunately KD's free agency popped up right after that. Imagine if KD had one more year left on his contract at this point in time; that extra shot at redemption might have changed the whole scope of things.\n\nBeyond that I think OKC made some great moves to support KD but, again, in 2016, the league was dominated by TEAMS. It's not just that there were 3-4 stars on a team (which OKC arguably had with Ibaka, Durant and WB, with Ibaka being a little further off than the rest), it's that the role players were making all the difference. After dealing with Curry, Lebron, Klay and Kyrie you have to go through savvy vets like Iggy, Barbosa, Livingston, Frye and Jefferson. To top it all off you have dudes like Thompson eating rebounds. If KD or WB sit, no one's even going to throw a nice pass to Kanter/Adams and you have to pray that Singler or Morrow don't get eaten alive on defense. That's entirely what KD meant when he said the team was getting younger I'm sure; specifically in 2016, there were no vet guys (like Perkins, Fisher) around for stability and promising guys like Payne, Waiters, etc. were just too young to compete with ridiculously experienced teams like the Spurs and Warriors. \n\nI also cannot imagine how frustrating it is to play with WB for 9 years in a row and I think that is a huge factor in why KD left. WB is a great player and has grown each and every year in the league, but there's no way KD and WB were meant to function together. They got to 3-1 playing at their best possible level and lost that lead because it simply was not sustainable; WB needs dudes who are more pure off-ball players and KD is simply too good to wait on the wing while WB drives and kicks. They just need different teams at the end of the day. \n\nLastly I'm just happy for KD. In spite of all the shit going on it seems like he's a lot more at peace with everything than he used to be, from previous interviews. Sure he might have had a role in losing that 3-1, but at the end of the day I understand his decision. It might not be the decision that every NBA star would've made in the exact same circumstances, but it's the decision that makes KD happy and in the end everybody's just trying to make life better for themselves.\n\n", "id": "d8yyqpb"}], [{"comment": "I actually really enjoyed the article, but obviously I'm biased.
