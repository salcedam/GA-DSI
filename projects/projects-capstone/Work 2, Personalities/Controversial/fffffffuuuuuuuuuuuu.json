Our time) \"And forgive us our sins\"\n\nThese are the same language, hundreds of years apart. The changes happened as people standardized words, spellings, and alphabets across the world, adapting the language and adding words to suit their needs. In a similar way, Yoga had its beginnings with simple stretches, balance, strength training, and flexibility training. As things progressed and the idea spread (albeit slowly and rather locally), the form became more complex, more varied, and more efficient. The base forms are still the same.

Since Yoga came to the west in the mid 1900s it has been warped and bastardized a lot and westerners have stripped it down to being a workout method that will make you flexible and look good naked. It is much, much more than that.\n\nYoga has been practiced for thousands of years, and thousands of years before, say, when Christ was born. Yoga in Sanskrit means union. When you practice yoga, you are practicing bringing the body into full unity with itself, unity between the body and consciousness and, if you want to go the full monty, unity between body, consciousness, and God.\n\nBut if you're not inclined to believe in God, that's fine. Just practicing yoga and mindfulness can be extremely beneficial in your life. Yoga will not only make you more flexible, it opens up your airways and improves cardio, it improves strength without the use of weights, it improves circulation of blood through your vessels and it will help teach you how to move through problems in life like dealing with stress, anger, and other emotions that we get wrapped up in.\n\nIn practicing yoga, you will experience your body being able to move and function in ways you never knew were possible, which I guess may not seem interesting to the Frito gnawing, mountain dew guzzling, I-live-in-my-moms-basement-playing-video-games-all-day, neckbeard stereotypes that tend to this subreddit, but you should never throw out the idea that it is vastly beneficial to your body and mental health just because our society thinks it's something only for women or that you have to believe in God to practice.\n\nGive it a try sometime.", "id": "d77xfes"}, {"comment": ">since the 60's\n\nyoga has been a thing since before 29**60's** (BC) -- some scholars even estimate it's 10,000 years old.", "id": "d78ahk7"}, {"comment": "Aleister Crowley was writing about yoga in the 1930s, if not earlier.

Our collective consciousness is being externalized, made concrete and now available on tap. We literally cannot put this toothpaste back in the tube. This ball is motherfucking rolling and everyday a more perfect repository of the human experience is added to and refined. \n\nI can carry the equivalent of the greatest library in the history of humankind around in the back pocket of my blue jeans, pull it out and tap the well of knowledge of millions in mere seconds. It's only a matter of time before we jack in completely and start contributing to this consciousness without even realizing it. Then it'll be seamless. We'll all resonate together and know everything and everyone perfectly without realizing we're even doing anything that isn't in our most basic nature. Even rage comics are a step. When done right (rarely), something so vital about the human experience is projected in a way that largely supersedes language and cultural barriers.\n\nShe would say \"why would I even want that?

That the lack of at least an, \"I've heard this quote:\", it's plagiarism.\n\nThis is mostly wrong; at least it's a dangerous way to assess criminality.  There very well could be cases where somebody explicitly quotes another person and only claims that they don't know where they heard it, but that's just unlikely. Also, there are many quotes, that have become _memes_, right?  That still resemble their original to an uncanny degree, that are spoken so commonly that it's actually unreasonable to assess the use of such a quote without citation regarding a single person, as theft of intellectual work.  IMO the people who find students guilty of plagiarism just because they didn't cite thoroughly enough are in violation of the spirits of all the safeguards and relaxing provisions of copyright law.  I think they are factually and legally wrong.  But you can be penalized as such within academia even if not legally.\n\nFinally, what the teacher did couldn't possibly affect the original author.  J.R.R. Tolkien has been dead for 43 years.  The scriptwriters who wrote extra things into the movies are just not affected by this kind of thing.  I said that the teacher could still be in violation of _copyright_ if what she did had a negative effect on the original author.

My husband and I had one child and he had a good upper management job and I was working a decent job that allowed me time at home with my son while I worked on finishing my teaching degree (I had to leave my senior year originally to take care of my mother after her heart transplant). I found out I was pregnant and everything looked great we were financially stable, had a nice home and two good cars. The whole American dream.   Then two weeks after we found out we were pregnant my husband's company suddenly shut down overnight.  We went from doing well to suddenly having only one income.  \n\nMy husband looked everywhere for a job even applying at McDonald's.  However in our small town no one would hire him because his degree was in computer programming from ten years prior and he had been working in a management position outside of his degree area. We looked at moving but because of the economy if we sold our house we would actually end up owing money.  So we were stuck. We had savings and my husband received severance pay so we pulled our son out of daycare until he could find a job and I picked up double shifts at work.  \n\nAfter five months of working doubles and eating slowly at our savings I was put on bed rest and suddenly no one was working.  My job offered insurance but it was terrible and our hospital bills were around $25,000 after insurance. We went through our savings and pulled from our 401(k).  Two weeks after our son was born I went back to work.  About two weeks later my husband was offered a job.  The position was in another state for a manager position.  We worked out with my parents to take over our home loan and they bought our house for what we owed on it so it came out a wash.  We used what we had left to move across country.  \n\nWe had exactly two days to find a place to live.  Once we did move the owners informed us that the position was for assistant manager.  However, at this point there is no turning back.  I couldn't work because I was not accredited due to having to put school on hold so I stayed home with our two kids.  It was really hard to go from making 110 thousand a year with savings, 401(k) a nice home and vehicles to renting a two bedroom apartment, one vehicle and making $25,000 a year.  The best planning means nothing.  Luckily now we are in a much better place.

Everything we own has planned obsolescence and can just be replaced, and we tend to adopt the same attitude with marriage.  So we get married until the honeymoon is over, then divorce and repeat, never realizing that it's a reinforcing loop.\n\nBecause we view marriage as disposable, we feel no incentive to put significant effort into the marriage, which causes the marriage to go into the tank.  Sometimes being in love and married is easy.  Sometimes it's not.  Being willing to put in the work when it's not easy is what makes the difference.", "id": "d5kbi3n"}, {"comment": "Which begs the question though.... is marriage itself obsolete?\n\nI mean we come from hunter-gatherer groups in which there was no marriage, sex just happened and the females took care of the young while the males provided.\n\nThen marriage was instituted as a tribal 'treaty' sort of, where I make a pact with you by giving you my daughter to your son, and we are now bound by family.\n\nThat's where it came from. I have to ask is it still relevant today? I'm not one to follow social conventions just because everyone else is, or because \"that's the way it's always been done\".\n\nAnd thank you for your insightful response! I totally get the disposable concept there; I just took it in the other direction.\nAlso, may I ask your gender, age, and marital status?\nThank you.", "id": "d5kcrzf"}, {"comment": "Marriage evolved as a social construct because it was beneficial for society to formalize those relationships.  It wasn't merely tribal treaties, but also having a pact between spouses made it less likely that the provider husband up and abandons the caregiver wife and kids, which meant the tribe was less likely to die off.\n\nAlso, by supporting monogamous relationships, the risk of spreading infections is reduced.  I don't know if early societies figured that out, but it wouldn't surprise me if they did.  After all, they figured out that moldy bread helped heal wounds.\n\nI don't think marriage is as relevant today from a health standpoint, but from a societal cohesion standpoint, I think it's absolutely critical.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between single parent households and juvenile delinquency.  That may have less to do with the absence of the parent and more to do with absence of the increased economic stability that comes from having a two parent household.  Nevertheless, the research is clear that children in dual-parent households tend to do better in life.\n\nEven if children are excluded from the analysis, I think marriage still has a place.  Yes, all of the most obvious benefits of marriage can be had outside of marriage.  You can use tinder to get laid.  You can get a roommate to save money on housing.  You can share the burden of caring for children if you did have them (with each other or otherwise).  But what you lack there is stability.\n\nIt's like the difference between a renting and owning a home, or between being a contractor and being an FTE.  Without the \"vows\" there is nothing binding you together other than your choice to be bound together at that particular moment, and if in the next moment you decide otherwise, \\*poof\\* off you go.  The institution of marriage straddles the line between Safety/Security and Love/Belonging in Maslow's Hierarchy.  Without the commitment, it's difficult for a party to the relationship to feel secure, and that feeling is important for our overall well-being.\n\nI would argue that while technology makes the world \"smaller\", it has also had the impact of isolating us from those around us.  Here I am talking to you, some unknown person from who knows where about a significantly deep subject, but if I'm honest, I don't have many friends \"in real life\".  Tinder may get someone laid, but does it foster meaningful interpersonal relationships?  Not particularly.\n\nI wouldn't say that marriage and deep, meaningful relationships are congruent, as it's certainly possible to have deep, meaningful relationships while unmarried, or with people other than one's spouse, and it's certainly possible for spouses to not have a deep, meaningful relationship (especially given the developments in society's attitudes toward marriage over the last several decades).

You are a man and therefore not destined for precise feeling-based manoeuvres. Go train in that area however you can and you will magically succeed.   \n\nExample: Guess why loving yourself results in self esteem and girls? Because girls often lack self esteem. If you love yourself, you act like a confident man. You are attracting low self esteem girls this way.  \n\nAnother example:  \n\n* Be fat and a depressed = You walk, act and talk bad = What girls don't like, because they don't like bad feelings.\n* Be fat and laughing (despite depression) = You walk and act confident and fake laugh = Most Girls see a teddy bear who understands feelings\n* Be slim and depressed = You'll attract bitches and be stuck with short relationships\n* Be slim and smiling = You'll attract bitches set onto your money (might even marry to get it)\n\nPoint is: Women act on feelings and will find reasons for it. Play their game to control it. It sounds bad, but women really seek for security. When you make them feel secure, they will stick to you.  \n\nFinally, look up \"The 7 laws of Hermes\". It looks like spiritual bullshit first, but these rules simply describe our existence. Get yourself ordered, watch out how these rules fold out in real life, and fall in love over and over again with her. It's natural to not love each other for a while - just to fall in love again.

You give her confidence by that for free. \n\nSome more random advice that worked for me, a previously VERY fat depressed basement dweller with no friends IRL at all: \n\n* Try /r/keto to get slim. Gets your blood works right and your fat down - by eating bacon, meat and sick breakfasts. Keep a daily diet diary via online food apps. \n* Do sports in the gym and get yourself to at least 2 sessions per week, each 1-2 hours, get at least half an hour of cardio training (at least!!!).  \n* Listen to music while training. Understand training is about switching off your brain from EVERYTHING. You and that crosstrainer are what matters. Everything else is whatever. Try watching episodes on your phone while training for long sessions, so learn to convert those for your phone.  \n* /r/howtonotgiveafuck \n* Listen to \"Wear sunscreen\" or read the text it's based on at least once\n* You are your own nemesis, or god.

Spirituality seems like a vehicle to me for these things. The content, however, mostly works out.  \n\nThe other thing has either a [low background](http://i.imgur.com/PmxD4.jpg) or a large, [almost scientific background](http://www.laddertheory.com/). Basically to get a girl - and this applies to getting sex as a married guy with the wife as well - become a man worth it. Understand how she works (read the first link of this post) and how dating actually works (second link, not mandatory though). \n\nI am a very fucking happy puppy with my girl. Two and a half years after our first kiss we still fall in love with each other. I started as a depressed neet before meeting her. Get your shit together, start training and just pretend to be the guy you want to be. Just like with presentations, almost nobody notices you're nervous.\n\nBut I think love is outside of all these games. It's natural. But to get it, you need to be able to see it, reach out for it, grab and hold onto it. But it's a natural thing and therefore swings in an out (hermes laws). If you stick to it too hard, you'll remove the energy the love needs to swing back to you. It can get stronger by swinging more - just like on a playground swing. Want more love? Be ready to drop it temporarily. Trust.\n\n...yeah, these \"spiritual laws\" aren't so stupid as one might imagine.

You have sheetrock walls, which can easily be breached, you have glass windows, which any child could break, and your door locks use 19th century technology that was completely defeated a century ago. However, there is no way to remotely attack thousands or hundreds of thousands of houses simultaneously, so you only have to worry about burglars that are physically present.\n\nWith computer security, that whole equation is inverted. Your biggest threats are from remote attacks and fishing social engineering targeting your employees. You control your facility, presumably you also control access to the rooms where these computers are, and as such the threat of a Chinese hacker walking into the building and sitting down at an open computer is extremely low compared to the threat of some sort of remote attack. \n\nLocking the screen basically only protects the computer from other people who already have physical access to the computer... Which, the vast majority of the time, is people you already trust; employees who already have their own accounts and their own computers. And, supposing you do for some reason let non-trusted people have physical access to your company's computers, they could bypass the screen lock and access your data by removing the hard drive or by using a live-disk on a thumb drive.\n\nThe screen lock might keep your cube-mate from joking around with your email, but it isn't keeping your data safe from hackers any more than closing the dining room window keeps bullets out of your house.", "id": "d363xef"}, {"comment": "I think it depends on the industry.

Something that has actually happened many times in medical facilities is a coworker, who maybe wants to learn more about her ex-husbands new girlfriend, will seize an opportunity to jump on a coworkers computer and look up that persons record when they get up to go to the bathroom or something.\n\n5. This is such a huge issue that some places have security cameras installed to have evidence in these situations, because if it shows a person accessed a record that they had no reason to access, it's typically immediate termination.

I do think you shouldn't be marked down for wrong answer as it's part of learning process. If you mess up the homework but learn from it. Then you'll do well on the test and your class grade well be reflected accordingly.\n\nBut if these teachers don't actually check the work/answers and only give a grade that is: attempted=%100. Then the earnest student won't even know they've made a mistake and thus won't even have the opportunity to correct their errors prior to exam.\n\nI had a teacher who would mark mistakes/wrong answers. You'd then have to make the corrections and resubmit to get a %100. Which I understand is taxing for the teacher who now had to grade and regrade assignments but at the very least mark the mistakes and still award a %100. Allowing a self motivated student to ask questions and make necessary adjustments prior to the exam.\n\nI also had a great teacher who'd grade exams where each problem was worth 5 pts. Attempting to solve would be 2 pts, using the right method to solve would be 2 pts, correct units/sig figs for the answer would be 1 pt and arithmetic errors (that resulted in the wrong answers) would deduct 1/2 pt each. So if you did everything right but accidentally had 5/2 = 10 (woops multiplied instead of divided) in one step of the process you'd still get credited 4.5/5 for the problem. As long as you carried out the rest of the steps correctly using the wrong \"10\" from your earlier mistake. I thought that was an excellent way to grade as it emphasised comprehension of the underlined theories.

The amount of hyperbole on this website, and the Internet as a whole, is so great that if half of the stories were 100% true, this world would have burned down long ago.\n\nI highly suggest you go approach a cop and just talk to them, ask how their shift or their day is going.

Those are some of the most boring, loneliest posts, I'm sure they'd be super grateful just to have someone to talk to and carry on a conversation with.

My experience includes my family being threatened by a cop (though thankfully nothing came of it), news stories, friends who've had their homes raided for crimes they did not commit\u2026 More than reason enough to be scared.\n\nAnd unlike you, I'm not stupid enough to ignore the experiences of others, nor to assume that it won't happen to me.

You have to be paranoid about cops and how they perceive you, or they might decide to fuck you over for how you look.
