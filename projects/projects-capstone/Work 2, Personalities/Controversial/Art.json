", "id": "cz3jgle"}, {"comment": "Many people think he's a pop culture apologist because the surface of his interviews (and art media) was very plastic.  Take for example this [1964 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr8NE7r1szU) where his only response to questions is \"Yes/No.\"  This is arguable of course, but he antagonized the media at times to get his point across.  We're talking about the man who once said something along the lines of \"Good and bad press should be measured in inches,\" as any sort of printed material, he considered, in his favor.  \n\nThe un/fortunate part of some post modern and contemporary art is that it's very difficult to pull out a \"singular\" meaning or interpretation to work.  Generally, it takes a little more analysis into the *body* of work being produced by the artist.  So in this case, consider that Warhol's first professional job was to draw [shoe advertisements](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xLZFYIlosOw/UpSDwwNt9WI/AAAAAAAALAg/uNDXcyuKphw/s1600/03_1955_Warhol_Palizzio_S.jpg).  His background aligns him with advertisements, products, and commodified objects as his area of interest.  Also, think back to what's happening in American history at the time.  Men are returning from war, and the consumption of American products is at its high.  \n\nIn 1956 [The Miracle of the Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e61omDYJdeU) promoted the circulation of canned goods as something consumable in any season, available at any time.  Military men would have already been accustomed to accessibility to food from a can.  Warhol's 1962 prints of Campbell's soup cans, came only a few years after that promotion.  His critique *could* be about the rapid accessibility to this commodity and also a reference to the technology of the Atomic Age.  For example, consider the importance of the Atomic Age after the atomic bomb, and how discussion of elements would have largely been a household topic.  The soup cans are presented as an entire work in a grid [The Campbell's Soup Cans](https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-cans-1962).  Now think to the way the Periodic Table is generally illustrated.  Now this is a stretch in interpretation, but it certainly points to a moment in American history where modernism and modernity are found in \"the modernist grid.\"  Many have written about the grid being a symptom of a time when the prevalence of \"logic and rationale\" overtakes lines of thinking after the trauma world wars.\n\nSo, the can isn't a good or bad critique about products; it's just a look at how the everyday (pop) items permeate the artistic realm and vice-versa.  He points to these objects as having a bi-directional influence: on artists, and on the public.  \n\nThis is all to say that its not about what the soup can means, but rather, how you yourself, recognizing the soup can's advertisement AND also recognizing that it's part of artistic production, now possess a dual perception of the object.  \n\n*This* is the mechanism that most art historians point to in his artwork.  It's ironic because most people who don't want this sort of analysis on art, critique it because art shouldn't be over-intellectualized, when in fact, Warhol's work operates through both of these camps.  \n\nIt's absolutely a shame that Warhol died when he did.  I'm curious to see what his thoughts would have been or how he would have worked with our new forms of social media.   \n\nThanks for asking /u/bryondouglas !\n\ntl;dr Andy Warhol looked at marketing and contemporary life to provoke a complicated view of everyday life.", "id": "cz47fsa"}, {"comment": "Thank you for this, I really appreciate it.

Your eyes also react to different colors at different rates, For instance the eye will usually pick out bright reds first(hence stop signs, lights) you can use this to help guide the eye through the piece more intentionally. Noticed a lot of people giving you shit for doing a marilyn portrait, it is a bit tired subject matter but when you are trying to develop your work it can be good to tackle things with a lot of reference material to compare to, so don't let it get you down. Most important to remember is the motto of one of my first professors, \"art is not fun\". Keep challenging yourself and listen to all constructive criticism before deciding whether or not you think it's worth trying.

Aren't the big ones female? Anyway) so the center of her mass is about 1/3rds of the way into the canvas. This is refered to as the [rule of thirds](http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/) and is the backbone of successful composition. \n\nMy second note is while your gradient is beautiful, it doesn't lend itself well to suggesting distance or scale. How big is the fish compared to the human? How far away are they from each other? Adding some texture to the sea above would help establish distance, as well as darkening up the highlights on the fish. If the fish is more subtley placed, you can \"direct\" your viewer into seeing the diving human, AND THEN the fish. \n\nI (very very quickly) threw together a photoshop concept.

That's nice. The fish, unfortunately, distracts from this overall feeling since it draws your eye down rather than letting it drift down naturally (like the falling man). Removing the fish might be hard given it would be difficult to re-create that particular gradient, but leaving out elements is something to keep in mind for future work.\n\nOther suggestions: Keep practicing proportions on people.=) He's pretty close for a shadow but could use a bit more balancing out since his head seems just a wee bit too large in relation to the body.

You also build the color up in layers, so you have much more leeway. If you decide you don't like the color you just applied, you can wipe it off, and the underlying value structure and face will still be there (the base layer of oil paint has already dried).\n\nAdditionally, you can use cool techniques like loosely rubbing out the glaze so that the color is removed from the surface, but still remains inside of the cracks and crevices of brushstrokes.

Serotonin is the happiness chemical in your brain (I don't know if that's common to everyone, it's a special interest of mine). Often depression, as I understand, is correlated with serotonin deficiency. You want to be happy and can't understand or justify your depressed feelings logically. For instance, you have a beautiful wife or girl friend who loves you so much and you love her but your depression keeps you from being able to... I don't know I'm losing focus. Basically you can't love her and express your emotions and make her feel happy and appreciated and you can't even have sex with her when she wants you and she blames her self and because of this stupid chemical in your brain your watching her and your relationship wash away, and it doesn't even hurt as bad as you know it should because you've just become so numb.", "id": "d6j8w06"}, {"comment": "Perhaps noteworthy here, serotonin is *not* actually a 'happiness' neurotransmitter per se the way I've learned it. Instead, its core function is actually inhibitory in most brain regions. The trick is in what processes it actually inhibits: for instance, regions and mechanisms that are involved when people with anxiety and depression spiral into a negative feedback loop that drags them down. Serotonin keeps these regions from spiraling out of control and thus 'keeps people happy'. \n\nIt's inhibitory function can also be seen in what else it does. For example suppose an experimenter gives his participants a task where the participant has to guess which button presses will give him a reward (this is typically done with cents or food that the participant likes). The relationship stimulus->reward/no reward/punishment (take away reward) is not 100% accurate, so you'll need to guess around a bit before you figure it out. Every so often the rules also change so you have to notice that and relearn. If an experimenter gives participants a drug that decreases serotonin levels, participants will engage in 'loose-shift-behaviour': they are more likely to shift to another rule whenever what they currently do, is not rewarded. They are, in a word, much more impulsive, which hinders learning.\n\nLikewise, low serotonin levels have also been associated with increases in aggression and negative thought. \n\nIt was long puzzling for researchers how a neurotransmitter can simultaneously seem to cause depression and impulsivity/aggression. After all, being depressed and aggressive/impulsive are pretty much thought of as being mutually exclusive! What solved that apparent paradox was those studies on learning with mice and humans -- serotonin inhibits behaviors that are currently unadaptive, so low levels of it will produce negative experiences, will make us behave more shifty and impulsive, and so on.

", "id": "d6j5by3"}, {"comment": "It's not unnecessary. It's absolutely necessary to drawing people. Why?\n\nBecause to draw a character with clothes on you have to be able to draw the structure of the human body. Not only do you need a head, arms, torso, etc., but you also need to have them proportioned so they look right. The only way to learn to draw that is to do it hundreds or thousands of times. \n\nWhy not with clothes? Because clothes just add unnecessary complexity and distorts the form of the person underneath, and when you're practicing drawing the human form, it's pretty pointless. Clothing is an exercise all on its own.\n\nBut why not draw just the skeleton and then put stuff on top? Well you do that too. But humans also have a bunch of other pesky stuff on top of it like muscles, tissue, and fat, so it's useful to draw that stuff too. It just so happens to be easier to draw the shape of that stuff with skin on top of it instead of drawing muscles.\n\nBut why do people keep drawing people naked after they're good at it? Because you do it enough and it becomes muscle memory. It's downright easy to draw a basic nude figure after you do it long enough. And when you start drawing people, at least in a classroom, naked people is ALL you draw. Unfortunately for some, that's where they stop. Clothing is hard. All sorts of different textures, materials, designs, etc. So a lot of amateur artists don't go there and stay perfectly content trying to master drawing naked/almost naked human forms.\n\nBut why is it never naked dudes? Well, you draw that too, but it's not shared nearly as often. Why? Honestly I don't know. Maybe because some artists don't like drawing naked guys, or because the ones that do draw naked dudes don't share it, or the ones that do get shared don't gain a lot of attention because other people don't like it/don't want to share it.

Otherwise you can follow a book or just find pictures you like online and copy them. What I did was to find a certain face or posture I liked and to copy it over and over until I got used to drawing different parts of the face, or a body in proportion. \n\nOne book I'd recommend is Charles Bargue and Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me by such and such author (forgot their names). It's a book filled with figure studies that you can copy, as well as pictures of process, as in how to go from an outline to a full realistic drawing. It's expensive but you might find some screens online (i got it from a friend).\n\nSome tips I'd give:  \n1. Don't get discouraged, drawing takes time and often you will try your heart out and end up with nothing. This will frustrate you but always know you might not have something on paper, but you have at least experienced failure which will influence the next time you try.  \n2. Don't get bogged down in details. No matter what you are drawing, be it an eye, or a whole person, work on the macro before you do the micro. Not only will drawing details first tire you out, it will most likely cause you to lose perspective/proportions.  \n3. You don't need to finish everything you start (contrary to many people's belief).

It's not really necessary, since the gold stars and the internment camps already come ideologically packaged with the armband.

We are a part of nature, and we are the ones who built factories, vehicles, refined oil, etc.\n\nThis piece, moreso than the original, conveys that human beings do not hate nature. We can both love nature, and want to build things. The problem arises when our building things harms nature. In that light, the idea of an abusive relationship is much more interesting and nuanced than a gun pointed at nature's head. This is symbolic: we love nature, but at the same time, we do things that hurt nature. How can we reconcile the two?\n\n2: The metaphor of the industrial complex as a \"bad boy\"\n\nThe artist portrays the industrial \"person\" as a bad boy. He has skull rings, and pointed/flaming fingernails. It reminds us of the classic tale of good girl wants bad boy, even though she knows he's dangerous. We even see some hints that this relationship is perilous for nature: dead trees on her head where she gets close to industry, birds fleeing.\n\nAgain, since we are actually both sides of this, it symbolizes our attraction to industry. We like industry primarily because it's different from nature. It gives us things nature can't (cars, houses, buildings, technology, an easier life), but it's also dangerous (global warming, pollution, even things like car accidents, machinery accidents etc.). Does the good outweigh the bad?\n\n3: The romeo/juliet metaphor. There's the idea that nature and industry are fundamentally incompatible. They are two different worlds. And yet, they long for each other. Again, humanity loves nature, but humanity also loves industry. How can we reconcile the two when industry (at least in some forms) harms nature?\n\nOverall, a lot more nuanced than the original, which only had one layer:\n\n\"Nature good, industry evil\"", "id": "d5984lf"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d59dj3s"}, {"comment": "Agreed.

Those particular thought exercises seem quaint today, but by extension, I wonder what things preoccupy us now, which might seem irrelevant to a future more enlightned people. \nIt didn't seem like a stretch to me to combine those two interests, but I also wanted to make it visually compelling, so the wet (maybe gross to some) look of the chicken and hatching eggs are aestheticized.
