The first Bishop of Rome to be referred to as Pope was John I (523\u2013526). All John's predecessors were only ever referred to as 'Bishop'. The Orthodox may accept Peter was the first Bishop, but they would teach that all subsequent Bishops derive their authority from him, not just the one in Rome. \n\nBeing the first Bishop (perhaps) gives Peter a sort of prestige, though many of the other Apostles also had prestige in different ways such as Paul being the first Missionary, etc. But this prestige was considered only in terms of 'first among equals', and they believe all subsequent Bishops were equal in authority under Christ. \n\nIn an early Council the united Church did accept that the Bishop of Rome was first in order of importance, but they only thought this in terms of prestige, not in terms of a hierarchy of authority. And this 'first in prestige' title was later given to the Bishop of Constantinople instead after the Capital of the Roman Empire was moved there.\n\nEdit: to correct information about the title 'Pope' in Orthodox Church", "id": "d05qazz"}, {"comment": "[first pope search on google](https://www.google.com/search?q=first+pope&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS590US590&oq=first+pope&aqs=chrome..69i57j5j0l2.4418j0j4&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8&hl=en-US)\n\nAnd I can see what you mean with Jesus not being Christian.

When we stop shaking the phone, likely the real position of the tile pattern and our perceived position are not perfectly in sync, so we see a slow (jello-like) move back to it's position.\n\nI believe this is described as [second order motion perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_perception#Second-order_motion_perception)", "id": "d85oy0v"}, {"comment": "I didn't notice the dog until I read your comment", "id": "d85vskk"}, {"comment": "Hold up, are you saying there's a dog in there somewhere?!", "id": "d861b78"}], [{"comment": "[For those who can't see it.](http://i.imgur.com/0aG1404.jpg)\n\n[Shake harder!](http://i.imgur.com/2ieP4r4.gifv)", "id": "d85gpos"}, {"comment": "After far to long arguing with myself.

It is made up of about 91% copper.](https://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specifications)\nA gram of 100% pure[ copper goes for about half a cent,](http://coinapps.com/copper/gram/calculator/) so 5.1 grams, or a quarter's worth, would cost you a little over 2 and a half cents.  Now, if pure copper will work, then you can basically make quarters for literally 10% of the cost, assuming you have the capability to shape them into slugs yourself.  If you have to taint the copper with Nickel, it gets a little more expensive, but not by much.\n[Pure Nickel goes for about $7.70 for 100G](http://www.chemicool.com/elements/nickel.html), so about 8 cents a gram.  You'd need about half a gram per quarter, so you'd be adding about 4 cents to your cost, which means you could still be making quarters for about 6 and a half cents a pop.\n\nNot bad.

Might end up costing more than the quarter though.  \n\nEDIT:  Just for fun, here's the math.\n\n[A quarter weighs about 5.6 grams.  It is made up of about 91% copper.](https://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specifications)\nA gram of 100% pure[ copper goes for about half a cent,](http://coinapps.com/copper/gram/calculator/) so 5.1 grams, or a quarter's worth, would cost you a little over 2 and a half cents.  Now, if pure copper will work, then you can basically make quarters for literally 10% of the cost, assuming you have the capability to shape them into slugs yourself.  If you have to taint the copper with Nickel, it gets a little more expensive, but not by much.\n[Pure Nickel goes for about $7.70 for 100G](http://www.chemicool.com/elements/nickel.html), so about 8 cents a gram.  You'd need about half a gram per quarter, so you'd be adding about 4 cents to your cost, which means you could still be making quarters for about 6 and a half cents a pop.\n\nNot bad.

"], [-1, "Well this sure is a totally fair and unbiased comparison.\n\n"], [-1, "My spiel on units:\n\nThe US in general uses older measurements because our industry evolved with them and now it's too hard to change.  The layman might think that changing units would be as simple as making a law, but it isn't.  For example: every machinist in the United States was trained with imperial [feeds and speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeds_and_feeds), and can make nearly perfect educated guesses with these units during the manufacturing process.  They know how .005\" affects a part, but learning everything again in mm would be a pain in the ass and take a long time.  Mistakes would be made.  It's very likely that a part designed today in mm would be converted to inches during the manufacturing process.\n\nThere are more \"common\" screw and drill sizes in the imperial system.  Measurements have become parts of daily life to the extent that changing them would wreak havoc through confusion.  Even on the tires of a BMW you will see 225/45R17 - the last number is the rim diameter in INCHES.\n\n\n**The logic of the imperial system:**  Imperial units are often based off of a common object.  The nautical mile for example came from celestial navigation.  One [nautical mile](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Nautic_mile_definition_v2.png) is equal to a minute of arc longitude.  So you can see that to a sailor, this measurement is much more logical for navigational purposes than km of feet.  ...Guess where \"feet\" comes from?  Some units have built in significant figures - my favorites being \"Fahrenheit\" and \"stone\".  A car thermometer can read the temperature to an accuracy of around 1 F.  When you switch it to C, the shown temperature is more precise than it can actually be measured.  The same with stone - you can look at a guy and say \"he's about 10 stone\" (140 lbs, 64 kg) with a high degree of confidence.  You know he's too small to be 11 stone, but definitely larger than 9 stone.  The margin of error is within a stone, so people know by the unit how the measurement was taken.  This is important because humans by nature, make thousands of assumptions every day (you can assume that the red light still means \"stop\" tomorrow morning, since it's been that way before).  If you said \"I'm 142 pounds\" it can be assumed that you were weighed on a scale.\n\nOften as imperial units get smaller they follow a binary pattern - 1\", 1/2\", 1/4\", 1/8\" or gallon, quart, pint, cup, gill, fluid ounces.  This makes quite a bit of sense for certain types of measurements.\n\nTL;DR - different units are good for different things in different places."], [-4, "Possible arguments for Imperial measurements:  \n  \nImperial is easier for mental arithemetic:  \n  \n1/12 - 1\" - 0.83 cm  \n1/6 - 2\" - 1.66 cm  \n1/4 - 3\" - 2.5 cm  \n1/3 - 4\" - 3.33 cm  \n1/2 - 6\" - 5cm    \n  \nTime is imperial:  \n360 degree circle, divides cleanly into 12 hours, into 60 minutes and then 60 seconds.  \nAll easily divisible by 2,3,4,5 and 6\n  \nAlso estimating times: 60mph (highway/motorway) = 1 mile / minute    \n  \nImperial is also a good \"human\" measurement:\n\n1 yard is roughly a human waist, or a single stride.  \n1 foot is roughly a foot, or forearm length.  \n1 inch is the width of an average mans thumb at the base of the nail.    \n0F is a cold day, 100F is a hot day.  \n\nWhereas, metric is hard to \"visualise\":  \n1 metre = 1/10 millionth of the distance pole to pole through paris.  \n1kg is the mass of 1litre of water at melting point.  \n  \nAlso a pint of beer is bigger than a \"half-litre\".    \n  \nI'm from the UK and am comfortable with Metric and Imperial.

The layman might think that changing units would be as simple as making a law, but it isn't.  For example: every machinist in the United States was trained with imperial [feeds and speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeds_and_feeds), and can make nearly perfect educated guesses with these units during the manufacturing process.  They know how .005\" affects a part, but learning everything again in mm would be a pain in the ass and take a long time.  Mistakes would be made.  It's very likely that a part designed today in mm would be converted to inches during the manufacturing process.\n\nThere are more \"common\" screw and drill sizes in the imperial system.  Measurements have become parts of daily life to the extent that changing them would wreak havoc through confusion.  Even on the tires of a BMW you will see 225/45R17 - the last number is the rim diameter in INCHES.\n\n\n**The logic of the imperial system:**  Imperial units are often based off of a common object.  The nautical mile for example came from celestial navigation.  One [nautical mile](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Nautic_mile_definition_v2.png) is equal to a minute of arc longitude.  So you can see that to a sailor, this measurement is much more logical for navigational purposes than km of feet.  ...Guess where \"feet\" comes from?  Some units have built in significant figures - my favorites being \"Fahrenheit\" and \"stone\".  A car thermometer can read the temperature to an accuracy of around 1 F.  When you switch it to C, the shown temperature is more precise than it can actually be measured.  The same with stone - you can look at a guy and say \"he's about 10 stone\" (140 lbs, 64 kg) with a high degree of confidence.  You know he's too small to be 11 stone, but definitely larger than 9 stone.  The margin of error is within a stone, so people know by the unit how the measurement was taken.  This is important because humans by nature, make thousands of assumptions every day (you can assume that the red light still means \"stop\" tomorrow morning, since it's been that way before).  If you said \"I'm 142 pounds\" it can be assumed that you were weighed on a scale.\n\nOften as imperial units get smaller they follow a binary pattern - 1\", 1/2\", 1/4\", 1/8\" or gallon, quart, pint, cup, gill, fluid ounces.  This makes quite a bit of sense for certain types of measurements.\n\nTL;DR - different units are good for different things in different places.", "id": "czde0sm"}, {"comment": "Who do you think invented the Imperial system and do they still those units now?

More likely than not, you don't use any specialized units for any specific industrial purposes, so you'd fall into the \"layman\" catagory that I wrote about. As a result you don't understand why we use the units we do, which I explained above.  To reiterate a bit more plainly - the U.S. has an economy larger than the UK by a factor of 8.  Industry/design/special manufacturing is also a larger portion of our economy than it is the UK.  The longer we wait before switching, the more it gets dug in.  Since the UK deals with continental Europe frequently, it provided enough pressure to force the switch to metric for most daily life units.  Over in the US we didn't have that pressure, and continued using the imperial system to such an extent that it wouldn't make sense to switch.  Why would we?  We know how to use the system we have, and it works well enough.  Why would we create an economic problem to solve a non existing problem?\n\nThe switch is going to take a generation or more.

Yes metrication was a push from Europe but it was the correct thing to do.  The reason to make the change is that the metric system is massively more sensible and makes manipulation of results much easier in an scientific/engineering setting.

It's hard to quantify how much \"a pain in the ass\" costs.\n\nYou'll find that units are really just arbitrary reminders to help keep track of dimensions, and you'll find specific ones that work for your specific project.  A good engineer can work with whatever.  The US has some of the best engineers and scientists in the world making the most advanced aircraft, best jet engines, satellites, you name it.  We've done all this with a random mixture of units - some imperial, some metric SI, and some metric non-SI.  When I worked in space science our vacuum chambers read out high-vac pressures in Torr.  Why?  Who cares. Why ask \"why\" when it works fine?  Where I grew up we had a saying \"If it's not broke, don't fix it.\".  Essentially - if it works, why risk fucking it all up by changing it?  Why would we even bother spending a single dollar standardizing something that industry already standardizes in its individual sectors?\n\n**Complaining about units simply shows one's incompetence in the ability to work with them.**  At work I use whatever everyone else is using because it's simpler that way.

For ordinary humans who don't want to work out things based on the speed of light, it's just 1 meter.  If you've grown up with it, you know exactly how to estimate it - just as people who grew up with the Euro have no problem working with the cost of things, whereas those who grew up with DM, Francs, Lira etc. and decided to hang on to it by mentally calculating back to those will have a difficult time indeed.\n\nI'm entirely on board with the 12-based system, but your arithmetic only happens to work for the foot and somewhat the yard.  Go to the mile and things fall apart.  Similarly, in engineering, the mil is 1/1000th of an inch, not, say, 1/1200th.  60mph is convenient if that's your speed limit - then again in the U.S. it's often 55, 65, 70.  Try doing the math there.  The same really applies to metric.  If your speed limit is 120km/h then you're going 2km/minute, but when it's 100km/h, 50km/h, etc. you're just going to have to fall back to arithmetic.  Or, more practically, one's satnav.\n\nThe reason for not doing both is because it makes things prone to mistakes.  The reason for keeping both in some situations is because they really do make more sense there.  It'll be a very long time before the electronics industry fully does away with mils or even just 1/10th of an inch for many components, for example.

They were considered white under that system (welcome at white country clubs and the like), but they cared about black issues as well.\n\nAlso, my father and his family live in Miyagi. They live high enough up in elevation that they survived the tsunami, but just ten minutes away from their place (going down in elevation), everything was destroyed. I saw boats on top of gutted buildings. They knew a lot of people who died or went missing. They said the mountains groaned and roared.

Additionally, the lowest category appears to have the least representation on the map, which means the majority of counties are in a situation where *at least* 75% of their population possess a high school diploma.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that this data comes from the American Community Survey, and is a five year estimate of county population characteristics. It includes everyone in the county older than 18. This is important because there are two groups included in the estimates which are more likely than the average average American to lack a high school diploma due to circumstances outside the educational system's control.\n\nThose groups are the elderly and first generation immigrants. It is unlikely that these two groups by themselves explain the percentages of county populations lacking a high school diploma, but they do contribute to those numbers. First generation immigrants, for example, may have grown up in a different nation and come to the US as adults, lacking a high school diploma.

If you captured a wheel rotating 60 times a second precisely, at 60fps it would look like it was standing still, possibly be a bit blurry depending on exposure time.\n\nI think the way to go would be variable rate depending on what the director chooses for a given scene, and we're laying the groundwork for that with adaptive sync on GPU cards and monitors.\n\nFor example, scenes similar to well known gladiator / Saving private ryan scenes could be done at real 60fps instead of faking it by using every other frame or whatever tricks were used, and 30-45 fps for more normal scenes.", "id": "d5gyujh"}], [{"comment": "Is her name pronounced differently because of the \u00eb?
