If it was not under warranty, then that means there was a recall, or there were thousands of complaints of premature wear on the batteries that Apple decided to help you out, as a manufacture should when premature wear is due to design flaws. In college I worked in IT replacing MacBook batteries, screens, bezels, motherboards, etc. I remember at least 3 times a week we would have a MacBook come in with a crack or two around the keyboard. Apple made a recall on this but never made customers aware of it, unless you brought it in and inquired about it. We would send in a notice to Apple and they would send us a keyboard bezel replacement. Then about a year later the iPhone 4 came out, and it had the most laughable problem of any problem a phone could have. If you held the phone and your skin touched the lower left metal part of the phone, you could get drastically reduced signal strength, to the point where your call could drop, or not be able to make calls at all.

I'm not sure how much you paid for the battery but my mindset would be since Apple typically has extremely high prices for replacement parts that the replacement service should be included for free anyway. The current price on their website for \"Apple out-of-warranty battery service pricing for Mac notebook\" is between  $129-$199 depending on what model MacBook you have. I don't know if that includes the price of the battery, I hope so. I remember in college I paid $25 for a new huge 12 cell battery for my Gateway gaming laptop and with the flip of a switch I swapped out the old and new battery. I realize Gateway cannot be compared to Apple by any stretch, but that was one experience where I was grateful I did not have a MacBook. Having a built in battery allows the MacBook to be a hair more slim, so that is one positive. \n\nI just wish the trend in cell phones of non-replaceable batteries would end! Having to send your phone in for repair to be gutted and put back together just to replace the battery is silly to me. If the major mobile carriers are going to stop offering free phones (or hundreds of dollars off) if you switch to their service, people are going to be holding onto their phones for a lot longer.

Apple Stores perform the replacement for free. I don\u2019t know of any other computer manufacturers that do that, especially for out-of-warranty computers for which you don\u2019t have a service contract. And of course, very few computer manufacturers have their own retail stores.\n\n>The current price [...] is between $129-$199 depending on what model MacBook you have\n\nThe model in question is a MacBook Air. I paid $129 for new batteries. That\u2019s quite a competitive price for batteries of that kind.\n\n>I remember in college I paid $25 for a new huge 12 cell battery for my Gateway gaming laptop\n\nYeah, the batteries in those are not comparable at all. It\u2019s like comparing the battery in an old Nokia dumbphone with one in a modern high-end smartphone.\n\n>Having a built in battery allows the MacBook to be a hair more slim\n\nNot only that, but the battery tech is completely different from the Gateway laptop. Also, that laptop was no doubt *a lot* thicker than a MacBook Air.\n\n>If the major mobile carriers are going to stop offering free phones [...] people are going to be holding onto their phones for a lot longer.\n\nThere are plenty of countries where legislation is in place that mobile carriers are not allowed to provide subsidies. In those countries, consumers still buy a new phone every 2 or 3 years.\n\n>And since batteries lose their ability to hold a charge over time, some people will have to get a new phone or send it in for open heart surgery.\n\nThey will end up with no OS and app updates before that happens. I buy a new phone every year (I realize I\u2019m an outlier). Whenever I get the new model, I sell my \u2018old\u2019 phone or I pass it on to a family member. My older sister is still using the iPhone 4 I bought back in 2010. After 5,5 years, its battery is fine, but she can\u2019t use the latest version of iOS.

Lets figure out how much power the LEDs are consuming.\n\n        Power = Current x Voltage\n        Power(LED) = 5 volts x .025 Amps x 5 (LEDS) = .625 Watts consumed by all 5 LEDs.\n\n2. Lets figure out how much 10% of the battery is (the amount of energy we must consume to turn off the 100% LED).\n\n        5200 mAh x 14 volts = 72.8 watt hours battery capacity\n\n        .10 x 72.8 watt hours = 7.28 watt hours\n\n3. Lets use the equation relating energy, time, and watts to figure out how much time we need these LEDs to be on to consume 10% of the battery (7.28 watt hours).\n\n        Energy (watt hour) = Power (watt) x Time (hour)\n     \n        7.28 watt hour = .625 watt x t\n\n        t = 11.648 hours\n\n4. So we now know that the LEDs will consume 10% of the battery (and thus trigger the 100% LED to turn off) when they are on for 11.648 hours.\n\n        If we assume the LEDs stay on for 5 seconds for each button click...\n   \n        11.648 Hours x (60 min / hour) x (60 sec / min) x (1 click / 5 sec) = 8,386.56 clicks\n\n\n\n**8, 386.56 Button Presses to turn off the 100% LED.**\n\n\n\nEEs of reddit, please correct me if i'm wrong!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "czcuabr"}, {"comment": "Holy shit that's impressive.

It also gave several examples of many insights that occurred to scientists during flashes of knowledge or enlightenment. \n\nOne example was probably about the discovery of benzene ring structure. And how equivalent theories are discovered around the world, in slightly different descriptions. \nThe article also argued that given this inherent human ability to produce science from natural inspirations, eventually all science could be discovered by thought experiments alone. \n\nThe article also said that  this applies to other animals also. One of the dogs they researched upon frequently arranged its poop in wavy patterns, making them think that he was signalling to some sort of string theory or loop quantum gravity. \n\nTL;DR: There is no need to work.

It would kill every process after giving them time to close all the files they are accessing etc. etc. to prevent things more important than a photo from being corrupted - depending on how the camera application is coded that may well include \"finishing\" the picture so that it can still be read even if a part of the picture is not there yet.

The physics is the same. \n\nit's light weight, efficient, inexpensive and easy to maintain. \n\nThis makes it an extremely effective and efficient oil filter for a single engine aircraft, a jet ski, speed boat, race car, etc. anything that spends most of it's running tome over 30 MPH\n\nthe big draw back to it is it'e inefficiency it slow speeds. It's effectiveness tanks quickly below 35 MPH and it is essentially useless below 30 MPH.\n\nSo, best air filter you can have on a race car, a prop plane or jet ski.\n\n\nWorst oil filter you can have on a school bus, a garbage truck or a mail truck. \n\n"], [3, "Uhhhh SAE 30 oil is for stuff like lawn mowers and stuff..."], [3, "You can buy this same oil at literally any auto parts store too.

If small amounts of diesel is introduced into a gas engine the engine will still run fine, just smoke a bit. If large amounts of diesel fuel, the engine will not run, but there is no actual damage to it, the fuel system would need to be purged of diesel and the engine will run again. This is why the nozzle on a diesel pump is larger than the nozzle on a gas pump, so the nozzle will not physically fit into a standard gas tank opening. \n\nAdding gasoline to a diesel engine is a different story.

They may interact with each other in various ways through torque converters, fluid clutches and whatever but they are distinct systems.\n\nWorking backwards, lets take a look at a simple 4 stroke. It has a crankcase filled with oil but no oil pump. The conrods have a 'spike' which dips into the oil to splash it around to lubricate the crankshaft bearings and cylinder walls. The splash lubes the cylinder so you dont need oil in your gas.\n\nA 2 stroke is different - it has no oil in the crankcase. Instead, the (oiled) gas is drawn into the crankcase and that is what lubes the bearings and wall/s. The brilliance of it is that it uses crankcase pressure (the piston on its downstroke) to pressurise the fuel charge (somewhat like a blower or turbo) AND uses the oiled fuel to lube the bearings and walls AND makes power on every downstroke.\n\nNow going back to the 4 stroke - what is lubing the cylinder walls and bearings? Oil splash. So all things being equal why would you need to put oil in your gas on a 2 stroke if it had the same setup? You dont. If the engine specifies using oil/fuel mix you can be sure that this is the only way to lubricate those parts and it doesnt have a separate oiling system.", "id": "d365hjf"}, {"comment": "My 2 stroke moped uses sae30 in the transmission.", "id": "d369r9o"}, {"comment": "> \"dollar general auto oil\"\n\n[One result](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22dollar+general+auto+oil%22&oq=%22dollar+general+auto+oil%22&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).. we did it Reddit!", "id": "d362zv2"}, {"comment": "A Google-Whack!", "id": "d364he9"}, {"comment": "google whacks cant be quotes", "id": "d3653q4"}, {"comment": "Thanks captian buzzkill. \n\n;-)", "id": "d365lf4"}, {"comment": ":) soz", "id": "d365v19"}, {"comment": "Apparently they are being sued for the same problem, but with other motor oils too: http://abcnews.go.com/US/gma-investigates-dollar-general-stores-facing-multiple-lawsuits/story?id=36876976", "id": "d367v8t"}, {"comment": "Hence why the rest of the picture is missing.", "id": "d3612j1"}, {"comment": "It actually says right above the circled part what it's supposed to be used for.", "id": "d3694ss"}, {"comment": "Wow, I've never heard of using a different type of oil in small engines.

Bitch please. Some white farmers have been killed but compare this to the amount of blacks killed and it all makes sense. Statistically less whites are killed than blacks even as a percentage relative to the percentage of the population.

Furthermore his bullshit source on that was publicly shown to be a bias bunch of shit by Afrifact which is like politifact and it well respected.  The whites even try propaganda campaigns like \"red october\" to raise awareness of the white genocide. This was publicly mocked. \n\nThe whites are better off by miles. The fact he is on reddit makes him better off than more than half the country. Harder to get jobs? Yes preferance is given to blacks with equal qualifications as part of a transformative approach to the economy. But then look below that and you see that less than 4% of blacks complete tertiary education while for whites it is in the high 60s.

Some damn fine stickin there son. \n\n[caption](http://imgur.com/2mVBhvP.jpg)[caption](http://imgur.com/nrtAvhc.jpg)[caption](http://imgur.com/abDFRLI.jpg)[caption](http://imgur.com/33ufYPX.jpg)", "id": "d3ny5jn"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d3qqpmm"}, {"comment": "Right? It's almost as if the road signs are made of a different material isn't it? Weird! This was directed at the folks who just couldn't believe someone would shoot a gun because they are sooo loud.

I think this post has finally run its course thank goodness. I'll continue to be curious until I shoot it myself, and you can continue to be sure of yourself.

Limes with small scald patches can be set aside for juice or zests, but definitely not garnishes. Also, IMO, they've been wastefully cut. Like all citrus fruit, limes naturally divide into 8-10 segments along their vertical axis. If cut along these segment lines, they lose almost no juice in the process and can be squeezed into the drink--if the customer wishes--or discarded without altering the drink's flavor. They retain their moisture and color. \nCutting a lime along the horizontal axis (like these in the photo) crushes the vertically-aligned segments, which promptly begin to weep juice and rapidly dry out, losing flavor and color. The customer who doesn't want that extra lime juice is also out of luck . In chunk form it can't be squeezed like a wedge. It just floats there, leaking juice until it's retrieved . I say \"floats\", because any bar that cuts its limes like these probably doesn't make that little 45-degree cut on the inside of the fruit that allows it to perch on the rim. Not knowing any better, they just plop 'em in. Kerplunk!.\nI'm hoping that this is from a restaurant prep kitchen, rather than a bar. ", "id": "d80sn10"}, {"comment": "Whoa. Thank you for this.

This has to do with neural edge detection to make the world seem more contrasty around the edges of objects and features.\n\nSo anyway the cells in between two keys get + firing rate due to the grey laptop surface center of the field, and TWO units of - due to the grey laptop space toward the edges in one direction. \n\nWhereas the cells that are responding to the intersections between the 4 keys get + firing for the grey in the center, but FOUR - firing units due to the grey in both directions in the inhibitory surround area. So the net effect is that this area is rendered as darker than the other grey areas, because there is more light immediately around it.

It has to do with center-surround cells in the retina.  These cells fire more when there is stuff in the center of their field, but also fire less when there is stuff close to the edge. 'Stuff' is in this case the grey of the laptop (more light bouncing off of it). This has to do with neural edge detection to make the world seem more contrasty around the edges of objects and features.\n\nSo anyway the cells in between two keys get + firing rate due to the grey laptop surface center of the field, and TWO units of - due to the grey laptop space toward the edges in one direction. \n\nWhereas the cells that are responding to the intersections between the 4 keys get + firing for the grey in the center, but FOUR - firing units due to the grey in both directions in the inhibitory surround area. So the net effect is that this area is rendered as darker than the other grey areas, because there is more light immediately around it.
