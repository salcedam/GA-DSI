", "id": "czddv1k"}, {"comment": "> The carriers adopted Android because it gave them considerable control\n\nWell I think they adopted Android because iOS was exclusive to AT&T and Android was another legitimate option on the table they could actually sell. Verizon pushed Android really hard and put a lot of weight behind motorola with the Droid campaign. \n\nAlso, if you look at what kind of software \"feature\" phones had on them in the early 2000s, it is easy to see that Android backed by Google, would be a big player.\n\nOf course that amount of control was a big deal about fast adoption, but I don't think it is the only element by far.\n\n>which is exactly why everyone except ATT told Apple to shove it their first go-around.\n\nSo you're wrong. The history of the iPhone is pretty well documented. Jobs didn't like the CEO of Verizon. Mobile was unstable and didn't have enough of the spectrum, and Jobs hated CDMA as a technology.\n\n>Steve thought about it and said, \u201cI have already decided that AT&T should be my partner. When I talked with [then CEO] Ivan Seidenberg at Verizon Wireless, he said, \u2018What does Apple know about wireless handsets that we don\u2019t already know?\u2019 T-Mobile was an \u2018unstable molecule\u2019 that didn\u2019t have enough spectrum. Sprint operates a CDMA network and I want GSM so I can launch this iPhone globally. That leaves AT&T\"\n\nHe dint go carrier to carrier and get shut down. He went after AT&T directly and consistently. At first they thought it was too big of a risk, but Apple gave a couple key presentations showing how they could make more money per customer if they did things a certain way, then negotiations started. Apple never really shopped around and got rejected from he other carriers. They wanted to be an MVNO and run their own subnetwork at first, but that plan changed. \n\nAlso, the negotiations over the iPhone happened in 2005-2006. Google acquired Android and five months after the launch of the iPhone. I think carriers were more desperate to catch up and Windows wasn't going to do anything to respond for awhile. I think Google had more leverage but they didn't care. They were not going to sacrifice ANY marketshare, even if it meant they were going to lose control.\n\n>This is the same Apple that was already a successful device maker\n\nAnd EVERYONE in the cellphone and cell industry expected them to fall on their faces. AT&T thought it was a big risk and they barely agreed. Most people were laughing at Apple, especially the established CEOs and companies.\n\n>Where exactly would android be if absolutely no-one adopted it?\n\nConsidering it took years for Microsoft and Blackberry to come around, I think there Android, with Google's backing always had a chance. \n\nLook a the growth in the smartphone market!!!! Blackberry and Microsoft were NOT apart of that in a significant way. That was a vacuum and Android filled that vacuum. If you think All the other carriers and OEMs were just going to wait around until windows phone 7 (November 2011), then you are wrong.\n\nAndroid was the largest mobile OS in 2010, before Microsoft was even had something to compete with.\n\n>The carriers would have found or coopted another OS that they could control.\n\nAs one? Or each with their own app store etc? They were already doing that and it wasn't successful. I think there was enough momentum that Google could have had leverage if they developed and polished android, partnered with an OEM like motorola and then made a phone that could run on the network.

I honestly can't tell the difference in quality between the 12mp picture in my phone storage vs the \"high quality\" up-to-16mp photo backup in Google photos.\n\nGoogle photos compression/image-handling is too good it shoots Google's free, unlimited, original quality marketing in the foot.\n\nI guess video is the other side; anything you shot will be no more than 1080p when it gets backed up to free Google photos backup.  But to be honest shooting 4k is so space-consuming it's not worth it on a 32gb non- expandable device.  I don't even bother beyond 1080p anymore and I have a 128gb sd card in addition.  4k fills up storage fast fast fast.\n\nA minute of 4k takes up around 500mb, give or take.  Assuming the 32gb models have around 24gb of space available, that's only 48 minutes of 4k video and literally nothing else.  That wouldn't even last me a day of a Disneyland family vacation.\n\n> 3) Google is now running the entire phone development process end-to-end which I assume is a lot more expensive than just building a base OS and providing input on design to hardware partners.\n\nI'm really hoping this path holds.  After a couple nexus phones, all I wanted was an integrated experience that always worked reliably with no tweaking.  I went with an s7 edge this time around from a nexus 6 because camera was at the top of my importance Kat since I have a toddler and I missed countless pictures thanks top Google camera.\n\nBut if Google can fix this reliably and make a phone that just works reliably all the time, it will be what I truly want in an android phone.\n\n", "id": "d8gc05c"}], [{"comment": "I haven't reached acceptance, and neither has my wife.

Then we bumped it up to 2GB and everyone complained that was too much, and overfill. A year later, 1GB was hardly optimized anymore. 2GB was the way to go, and then 3GB devices started rolling out. Now we're at 4GB and Nougat is going to start optimizing that amount of RAM. \n\nTrust me, RAM is something you can't \"over kill.\" The more, the better. Imagine a car, for example, idling at a red-light. While idling you can apply gas and immediately take off, (if in gear, of course.) but, imagine the car is shut off. And you want to immediately apply gas and take off? You can't. You have to start the car and put it in gear, apply throttle, and by that time, every other car at the red light is gone, and you're holding up traffic. \n\nIt's the same principle with more RAM. You're already idling apps in the background. They're just waiting to be reopened (apply gas) from their left off point. Do this with multiple RAM hungry apps (Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram) and you can easily transition from app to app. \n\nAndroid will never be as optimized as iOS, for the simple fact Apple can optimize it's software and hardware together. Android is not limited to one specific manufacture. It's basically just like Windows. Different hardware and different brands. \n\nBasically, \nIf everyone has the same mindset as you \"4GB is overkill\" then we'd be permanently stuck in a non evolving technological world. 4GB may be fine for you, but for others, like myself, I want to see the boundaries being pushed to the max. 6GB is already our there, let's try 8GB. That's starting to catch up with some gaming computer statuses. And nothing is wrong with that. You can buy 64GB RAM sticks for PCs now.

Read receipts? Don't offer them for SMS messages. Frankly, all these issues are already addressed relatively well by iMessage or even by Facebook Messenger, which can be set as a default messaging application on Android. Heck, even Hangouts has attempted (albeit clumsily) to address these issues.\n> \n> I get that any company wants to move away from the ugly stepchild that is SMS (and even uglier, MMS) and focus their efforts on the future, but you're not going to do it without a strong user base and a strong foundation. \n> \n> Maybe future releases will reveal that Google plans to make Allo the messenger they referred to in their Jibe/RCS update email.

It can charge the device, output audio, and video at the same time, that doesn't sound limiting\n\nI didn't say \"restrict the cables abilities\", I said \"restricted use of the USB-C port for other things\" -- because in order to charge the device and output audio at the same time, a special cable would need to be used....and if you happen to lose that special adapter cable, you're SOL until you buy a new one.  As long as a device still has a 3.5mm jack, you can use bog-standard cables and everything works completely fine as is.\n\n>Intel DAC? \" while the downsides involve usually-shittier DACs \" ??? What is this supposed to mean?\n\nI said nothing about Intel DACs, I was talking about Intel's proposed method of sending analog audio over USB-C, which is a work in progress and is not part of the USB-C standard.  Which means implementation of that method will most likely not be widespread, and will require yet another special type of USB-C cable.  The USB-C standard allows for sending a digital audio signal over the cable...but to receive digital audio, headphones would need to have their own onboard DAC/amp, which due to size and cost constraints will often be worse than the DAC/amps that phones already have.\n\n>You're telling me that say, a lg phone with a high end DAC would have them put a shittier one in their phone because they got rid of 3.5mm?\n\nThat's not even close what I was saying, but it is a distinct possibility.  Phone speakers are always terrible and obviously do not require a good DAC, so if the only other audio output of a phone is digital, there is absolutely no reason to put a good DAC in the phone.  But then, at that point a bad DAC wouldn't be a downside, since it could not affect the headphone audio quality in any way.  What *would* be a downside is offloading the DAC/amp to the headphones (a necessity with digital-only audio output), because 99% of the time, onboard DAC/amps on headphones are going to be worse due to size and cost restraints.\n\n>Also what is so special about intels implemwntation, other than they havent gone into much technical detail that i know about their plan sounds identical to whats already in spec.\n\nIt's not \"identical to whats already in spec\" -- as I clearly explained, the USB-C specification allows for digital audio over the cable, but Intel's work-in-progress method would send analog audio over the cable.  This a huge difference, and the fact that it's non-standard means that it's an Apple-esque feature that would require special cables, at increased cost due to licensing, just like Apple does with their cables.  Widespread implementation would also be less likely, since it's non-standard and phone manufacturers (in addition to cable manufacturers) would need to pay Intel to implement it.  Unless of course Intel open-sourced it....but it's Intel so that idea gets a big LOL.\n\n>As for consumer cost, thats only for rhe adapter\n\nExcept it isn't just an \"adapter\", it's a dongle -- a little brick, not just a cable.  That is, unless Intel's analog-over-USB method becomes common, but see above for that.  With digital-over-USB and no 3.5mm jack, consumers need either the little dongle, or completely new USB-C headphones.\n\nUSB-C headphones will eventually become common, and possible features like a temp sensor are great and all....but anyone with a USB-C phone (like my Nexus 6P) can already use those, and I'm sure they will once they're available at a reasonable cost.  But removing the 3.5mm jack from phones at this point in time *forces* people to use tech that they aren't prepared to use yet.

If you have say, 20+ diversified stocks what you own, it is unlikely you'll lose everything but there's still no guarantee there won't be some event outside of your control that will tank everything. \n\nInvesting that get emotional (oh, I believe in this company so I'll pour all my money there!) very easily so watch out for that. And if your main aim is to make good money when picking individual stocks, I recommend going in for the long term. Pick something you want to hold/buy more of for 3+ years if you can. \n\nHappy investing! \n\nPS: I was in the same boat about a year ago and started poking around looking for articles and it is amazing how much you can learn for free out there. /r/personalfinance  and /r/investing  are good places but remember not to take recommendations blindly from us random internet people.

There's only two flagship iPhones per year, so less fragmentation on the market. Historically speaking Samsung and Nexus hold their value the best, but they never hold value as well as apple devices. Of course there is a chance that the pixel will be on apples level but I highly doubt it. Unless reviews come out and it's absolutely revolutionary but only Apple and COD brands can release products that are hated heavily before release and still sell like hotcakes. \n\nWith the initial reception that the pixel got from enthusiasts and non enthusiasts alike I don't think it's going to do too well. It's just too generic of a smartphone in terms of hardware for people to get excited about and has some big omissions like water resistance or OIS/dual camera which other similarly priced flagships have. The pixel design also is not very eye-catching especially when compared to the Note 7, HTC 10 and V20. Googles only niche is stock android which is kind of barebones if I had to be honest so if that's their only reason to charge iPhone prices then it better be fucking good (I hope so for their sake). If the phone gets average reviews then sales will plummet and prices will drop fairly quickly. We shall see how it does when people get their hands on it.\n\nThe google phone release time also kinda fucks them in the ass and I was always reluctant to get previous nexus phones cause a few months later Samsung and all the big boys drop new flagships with updated specs and features. With their new pricing as well they will probably lose a lot of previous nexus owners to midrangers like Oneplus or go with another big hitter like the V20 which provide their own unique hardware features and gimmicks to win people over. \n\nTl;dr: speculation but I honestly think it's gonna be a flop and I wish I was as optimistic as you\n\n", "id": "d8f8ovj"}], [{"comment": "I'm not saying it's not better than my 6P.

Prior to the Motorola patents, this wasn't possible for Google. Additionally, without Jobs, Apple hasn't been the same.

Samsung has stumbled with the Note 7 explosions and Apple has slightly less hype than usual, I can agree with that.  But Samsung is also coming off their most complete phones in awhile with the Galaxy S7, some record profits and marketshare, and they'll still the only Android OEM who makes high end components (their screens and SoCs) and money in this industry.  I don't see them falling off their perch anytime soon.\n\nAnd if they did, there are tons of OEMs who have more mindshare in phones than Google who have the pedal to the metal full time.  Especially these Chinese OEMs like Huawei and ZTE.  All they need is one carrier to give them a chance and they can flood the West with cheap, high quality phones.\n\nAnd the popular media line of Apple falling off since Jobs died has been going on for ever and is pretty untrue.  Objectively they've only gotten more valuable and have sold more and more phones.  Hell at this point they'll basically saturated the high end market in almost every major territory.\n\n>I disagree with this because of the strong, out-of-the-gate marketing and because of the touted exclusivity (which means Verizon likely has an incentive to market as well). Granted, this is pure speculation.\n\nI actually missed this.  Exclusivity isn't a selling point.  That's actually a negative.  And it's again due to timing.  Back in the day the iPhone was exclusive to at&t, and that forced people to switch to them.  But we don't live in those times anymore.  The iPhone and every major flagship is available on every carrier.  No one is going to switch to Verizon for a Pixel no matter how much Verizon markets it and the average person isn't going to buy it online from Google.

But they have gotten much better at it than they were.  Take it from somehow who went from saying never again will I buy a non Nexus phone to someone who got the Note 7 and is actually happy with it despite the recall.  Their software is bloated, slower than it should be, and not as good looking at stock Android or the Pixel launcher/skin.  But it has improved by leaps and bounds.  Touchwiz looks fine out of the box (although I switched to a Material theme) and there are a few apps that I actually like.  Samsung Pay, S-Health, and their Game Launcher are all solid apps that I actually choose to use regularly.\n\nWe'll see if software features like Assistant end up lighting the world on fire, but I honestly don't have much hope of that, and that is the big software feature that you can't get on another phone.", "id": "d8furkx"}, {"comment": "And in the grand scheme of things, 3 apps?

The point is that Verizon will steer its *existing* customer base towards it in exchange for the exclusivity.\n\nWhy does that matter? Apple's share of annual smartphone sales fluctuates from 14 to 20%, let's say an average of 17%. Verizon has something like 35% market share: if 1 in 5 Verizon subscribers gets a Pixel this year instead of an iPhone or a Galaxy and pulls equally from both, then Pixel will be at 7% of smartphone sales while Apple only at 13.5%. Which means Pixel will have half of the iPhone's share of sales in its debut year, with only one device. That would be a huge success. Google knows it's all about marketing this phone, and has enlisted Verizon to help the average consumer in the store, who is not subscribed to any tech-themed subreddits, see, try, and finally buy a Pixel.\n\nEdit: and that market is already going to have locked bootloaders and Verizon apps on the phone, so that's not a differentiating factor they care about.", "id": "d8fw5lp"}, {"comment": "This, *yes*.

People see the iPhone as doing everything well, when the reality is closer to it doing everything acceptably, with a few pretty good areas and not a lot of drawbacks (although that seems to be changing now.)\n\nThe problem a lot of power users have is that there isn't an Android phone targeted at power users - that segment isn't large enough to justify that sort of phone, and especially the pricetag it would come with.  A lot of those users just end up going and getting the latest \"best of a bad bunch\" and then making due.  I have a list of features I want in a phone - I've never come across a phone that met every criteria, and I probably never will.  I'll just keep looking for the device that meets the most important criteria and keep looking."], [-1, "If the only thing I'm after is top-tier hardware, Android is - mostly - the place to be. It's gone LTE a few years ahead, it's moved towards OLED for years, bigger batteries are always a thing, more storage options that don't require extremely expensive mFI licensing deals. Oh hell, if I don't care about device updates I can, for under $500, get a phone with the specs of a freakin' ultrabook!\n\nBut all of this assumes I'm fine with the OS often getting in the way of getting things done, that heavy customization is preferred, that it absolutely needs to have flagship everything without similarly flagship pricing, that priorities and needs/wants stay constant over time. Every time I look at Android, I see a marketplace that hates smallness with a passion, where \"more is always better\" regardless of actual usage experience, where the relentless drive towards flagship quality at budget pricing feels more like a race to the bottom than a pursuit for perfection.\n\n4 years ago I came to the conclusion that the only good, usable Windows-based laptop out there was a Mac. Last year, I concluded Android remained a work-in-progress - too many people obsess over specs as the be-all end-all, ignoring every insignificant detail that altogether makes the experience less than satisfactory - and returned to iOS. Those \"little\" things like wakelocks, inconsistencies, vendor apathy... they don't look like much at first glance. Then again, a rolling snowball doesn't seem like much of a threat at the top of a mountain range, is it.\n\nSure, Android is far, far more customizable to your heart's content than iOS ever is. *But at what cost?* It's like paying $10 for a really cheap H&M shirt that shrinks to one size too small because its manufacturer skipped preshrunk cotton to save on its BOM, versus paying $30 for a Denver Hayes shirt that stays put despite repeated machine washing and drying cycles.\n\nWhat a shame. Was led to believe that Android is greener. Turned out it was a sham.\n\nedit: Here's a thinking cap for you guys. \n\n9 out of 10 people in a room shares one opinion that they believe is the \"correct\" one. The 10th has a different opinion. The other 9 tell the 10th that he's wrong, his opinions are irrelevant, he should feel bad for disagreeing with the herd. Who are you going to believe: the majority, or the minority?\n\nA rolling snowball at the top of Mount Everest is nothing to worry about as long as you're also at the top. But if you're lower down on the mountain, that's no small snowball, it's a *life-threatening avalanche*. Android, as a whole, is like that: all these minor inconveniences and niggles do count for something, and it's anything but a good time."]], [[{"comment": "iPhones just work.

Sure, it might not have the BEST battery or the BEST screen, but day to day performance is great, the camera is great, updates are released timely, even for older platforms, and the battery from my experience isn't that much lower than Android phones.\n", "id": "d7uj7tw"}], [{"comment": "For me, looking at the iPhone from a design standpoint, it's usually got less glaring oversights than equivalent Android phones.  Usually being the operative word.  The iPhone 7 is beautiful - it's got the nice form factor of the 6, without the silly antenna bands, no rear glass to shatter (although that's something they had for years.)  But it's not the best phone for me - I hate using the Apple ecosystem, I hate the proprietary connector, I hate the lack of personality and personalization.  (As an aside, I went to a holiday party and everyone had to leave their phones at the door.  There was a line of Apple 5S phones at the end and watching 10 drunk people fumble each other phones trying to find their own at the end was *very* entertaining.)\n\nI think the reason most people are mad at new Android phone launches and harp on things like bezels is because there are Android phones that tick those boxes, while others clearly fail (Like the Sharp Crystal X vs ye olde HTC chin etc.)  There are all kinds of phones that do a couple things great, but fail in other categories that lots of power users find important.  \n\nThere's no such thing as a \"no holds barred\" and \"no corners cut\" phone - not even the iPhone - but a lot of people find that they want an iPhone's hardware without the Apple experience. (And that's probably why there were and are so many iPhone clones.)  People see the iPhone as doing everything well, when the reality is closer to it doing everything acceptably, with a few pretty good areas and not a lot of drawbacks (although that seems to be changing now.)\n\nThe problem a lot of power users have is that there isn't an Android phone targeted at power users - that segment isn't large enough to justify that sort of phone, and especially the pricetag it would come with.  A lot of those users just end up going and getting the latest \"best of a bad bunch\" and then making due.  I have a list of features I want in a phone - I've never come across a phone that met every criteria, and I probably never will.  I'll just keep looking for the device that meets the most important criteria and keep looking.", "id": "d7vm9oa"}], [{"comment": "If the only thing I'm after is top-tier hardware, Android is - mostly - the place to be. It's gone LTE a few years ahead, it's moved towards OLED for years, bigger batteries are always a thing, more storage options that don't require extremely expensive mFI licensing deals. Oh hell, if I don't care about device updates I can, for under $500, get a phone with the specs of a freakin' ultrabook!\n\nBut all of this assumes I'm fine with the OS often getting in the way of getting things done, that heavy customization is preferred, that it absolutely needs to have flagship everything without similarly flagship pricing, that priorities and needs/wants stay constant over time. Every time I look at Android, I see a marketplace that hates smallness with a passion, where \"more is always better\" regardless of actual usage experience, where the relentless drive towards flagship quality at budget pricing feels more like a race to the bottom than a pursuit for perfection.\n\n4 years ago I came to the conclusion that the only good, usable Windows-based laptop out there was a Mac. Last year, I concluded Android remained a work-in-progress - too many people obsess over specs as the be-all end-all, ignoring every insignificant detail that altogether makes the experience less than satisfactory - and returned to iOS. Those \"little\" things like wakelocks, inconsistencies, vendor apathy... they don't look like much at first glance. Then again, a rolling snowball doesn't seem like much of a threat at the top of a mountain range, is it.\n\nSure, Android is far, far more customizable to your heart's content than iOS ever is. *But at what cost?* It's like paying $10 for a really cheap H&M shirt that shrinks to one size too small because its manufacturer skipped preshrunk cotton to save on its BOM, versus paying $30 for a Denver Hayes shirt that stays put despite repeated machine washing and drying cycles.\n\nWhat a shame. Was led to believe that Android is greener. Turned out it was a sham.\n\nedit: Here's a thinking cap for you guys. \n\n9 out of 10 people in a room shares one opinion that they believe is the \"correct\" one. The 10th has a different opinion. The other 9 tell the 10th that he's wrong, his opinions are irrelevant, he should feel bad for disagreeing with the herd. Who are you going to believe: the majority, or the minority?\n\nA rolling snowball at the top of Mount Everest is nothing to worry about as long as you're also at the top. But if you're lower down on the mountain, that's no small snowball, it's a *life-threatening avalanche*.

The majority of the people might be indifferent but there are a few willing to pay a premium for a \"Made in US\" stamp.\n\n* Apple itself wanting to legitimately play a part to help more Americans get jobs vs. outsourcing their work outside. If the costs were the same, they would lean towards American workers and that plays into it a little.\n\nThey have a lot more variables that go into this decision and companies all go through this decision process. Most of the time, the revenue boost gained by adding the \"Made in USA\" is low and the better error rate in the US are not worth it, and the lower costs in China help maximize profits better.

Additionally I believe that they are obviously positioning the pixel brand to go head to head with the Iphone and part of that is charging a premium price. Similar to the iPhone the pixel looks to take on making a premium experience through intensive optimization rather than raw power, and the early hands on reviews seem to support that impression. While I personally can't afford the pricetag, the market segment they're targeting absolutely can. They'll release an updated model next year with waterproofing. My bet is that in addition to the high r and d costs of doing so, they ran the numbers and decided that with time constraints it wasn't worthwhile for this product cycle if they wanted to preserve what are clearly their other priorities: a top of the line camera and heavily optimized, premium UX.

What you most likely saw in that video was left over plastic from the light/heart rate sensor streaking on the back of the phone or perhaps the back of the phone had a thicker layer of olio phobic substance. Or the back glass panel was just defective, which happens because glass manufacturing isn't perfect. Corning's tempering process requires vastly different sizes of glass molecules spread fairly evenly throughout the glass and if the section of glass in question just doesn't have enough molecules that are different sizes, the results will suffer. The larger molecules get pushed to the outside of the glass, to the surface, and the smaller ones get pushed to the inside. This creates tension in the glass, with high pressure on the surface, and low pressure on the inside, making the surface and inside pull agaist eachother. This tension is what makes tempered glass many times more hard than regular glass. \n\nLess size difference means less pressure, means less pulling/tension, means less hardness.

Ok lemme explain it for you. Post-processing is **NOT** done by a camera app, it is done by a software that is built into the OS. The camera takes a picture, but that photo is in complete raw form so it has to be processed by the camera API. The camera API is the one that processes, and the camera API is completely built into the OS, completely separate from the any camera app. That's why if you flash a AOSP rom on a Samsung phone, camera quality suffers greatly, because the camera API that was built into Touchwiz was removed and replaced. EVEN if you use the same Samsung camera app, the quality would be way worse, because camera apps USUALLY don't do any further processing, they just display the image given by the API.

The tagline says it all really, \"great isn't good enough\". There's nothing in particular about the HTC 10 that makes it jump out of the pack compared to the other flagships.\n\nSamsung have always had their AMOLED displays and now they have the S7 Edge. It's also got the jewellery-like allure of the glass and metal sandwich. The G5, flawed as it is, does have the novelty of the attachments and such. The HTC 10 is the phone that seems to get all the basics just about right, no more and no less.\n\nIs that a bad thing? No, I don't think it is. Personally, the HTC 10 is a very compelling phone. I think there are a few big advantages the HTC 10 has over its direct rivals. \n\n* The software is much cleaner than either the S7 or G5.\n* The metal build far outpaces the G5 (whether it betters the S7 is more down to preference, I prefer metal over glass despite owning a Z1)\n* The warranty covers bootloader unlocking, and if you're in the US you also get the advantage of replacement if the screen breaks.\n* The audio output when using headphones seems to be very good. And even over the speakers you at least have a dual-speaker output, even if it's not true stereo.\n* It is the only (?) current flagship that properly supports adoptable storage in Android Marshmallow.\n\nEven compared to the Nexus 6P, which would otherwise be my device of choice, you get the advantage of OIS on the same camera sensor, the extra performance of the Snapdragon 820, a microSD card slot, and some of the small, phone-specific improvements from Sense 8.0 (yes, even if it means slower updates).\n\nFor me, if HTC were to make a \"HTC 10 Max\" or \"HTC 10 Plus\" they would be very, very close to my ideal phone. Give it a 5.5\" or 5.7\" display, Super LCD 5 or Super AMOLED wouldn't phase me.

The tagline says it all really, \"great isn't good enough\". There's nothing in particular about the HTC 10 that makes it jump out of the pack compared to the other flagships.\n\nSamsung have always had their AMOLED displays and now they have the S7 Edge. It's also got the jewellery-like allure of the glass and metal sandwich. The G5, flawed as it is, does have the novelty of the attachments and such. The HTC 10 is the phone that seems to get all the basics just about right, no more and no less.\n\nIs that a bad thing? No, I don't think it is. Personally, the HTC 10 is a very compelling phone. I think there are a few big advantages the HTC 10 has over its direct rivals. \n\n* The software is much cleaner than either the S7 or G5.\n* The metal build far outpaces the G5 (whether it betters the S7 is more down to preference, I prefer metal over glass despite owning a Z1)\n* The warranty covers bootloader unlocking, and if you're in the US you also get the advantage of replacement if the screen breaks.\n* The audio output when using headphones seems to be very good.

Give it a 5.5\" or 5.7\" display, Super LCD 5 or Super AMOLED wouldn't phase me.

I've been so excited about this phone and it is turning out to be more of a disappointment than the G5. No flagship this year has impressed me. The Pixel is over-priced, the S7 has ridiculous software bloat and UI flash, the HTC 10 camera didn't impress me and those chamfered edges were a bit too large. The V20 was my last hope.\n\n\nImpressions: \n\n* The screen is BLUE. Like...really blue.  It has a feature to warm the color temperature, but it is too aggressive.  You're either really blue or really yellow with no true-ish white in between.  Due to the screen's terrible color temperature it is impossible to know whether the photos I took were accurately captured or whether the colors (reds in particular) were as way off as they appeared on screen.\n\n* Camera handled fluorescent lights better than both the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S7 Edge. Manual controls were good, but it was still difficult to reproduce the complex mixed fluorescent/halogen retail lighting accurately and HDR did not really help (I imagine the Pixel would have handled this combination lighting better). One of the volume buttons activates the camera shutter, which is nice. Burst mode took over 30 photos in a matter of seconds (it was super fast), which was impressive and gives me hope that that perfect moment can be captured with ease.\n\n* I completely factory reset the retail display phone and setup was super easy.\n\n* LG has toned down some of its UI nonsense, but I admit that a few icons had me confused. The UI of my G3 seems more simple and functional in many respects.\n\n* The second screen seems pointless so I turned it off.\n\n* Battery removal was super easy. The back panel pops right off and is reapplied with no difficulty.\n\n* The phone gets warmer than I'm accustomed to on my G3.\n\n* The phone is quite large and heavy. It doesn't feel as well balanced as the iPhone, S7, or HTC 10.\n\n\nMy conclusion: the phone's emphasis on photography is really undermined by the screen.  LG did great with screen quality in the G3 as one of the first QHD phones (trailing just behind Oppo) and it had decent color accuracy. They don't seem to learn from their successes or their mistakes.  Unless LG can push an update that addresses the color temperature, I won't buy it. The retention issue also causes me to question the quality of their components.  As /u/wilsonm0624 mentions, the blue color temperature may be intentional to prevent image retention. If that's the case, LG has really messed up here."], [1, "Not sure if I should just ignore all these issues or just ignore the current flagship phones and settle for less.

No flagship this year has impressed me. The Pixel is over-priced, the S7 has ridiculous software bloat and UI flash, the HTC 10 camera didn't impress me and those chamfered edges were a bit too large. The V20 was my last hope.\n\n\nImpressions: \n\n* The screen is BLUE. Like...really blue.  It has a feature to warm the color temperature, but it is too aggressive.  You're either really blue or really yellow with no true-ish white in between.  Due to the screen's terrible color temperature it is impossible to know whether the photos I took were accurately captured or whether the colors (reds in particular) were as way off as they appeared on screen.\n\n* Camera handled fluorescent lights better than both the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S7 Edge. Manual controls were good, but it was still difficult to reproduce the complex mixed fluorescent/halogen retail lighting accurately and HDR did not really help (I imagine the Pixel would have handled this combination lighting better). One of the volume buttons activates the camera shutter, which is nice. Burst mode took over 30 photos in a matter of seconds (it was super fast), which was impressive and gives me hope that that perfect moment can be captured with ease.\n\n* I completely factory reset the retail display phone and setup was super easy.\n\n* LG has toned down some of its UI nonsense, but I admit that a few icons had me confused. The UI of my G3 seems more simple and functional in many respects.\n\n* The second screen seems pointless so I turned it off.\n\n* Battery removal was super easy. The back panel pops right off and is reapplied with no difficulty.\n\n* The phone gets warmer than I'm accustomed to on my G3.\n\n* The phone is quite large and heavy. It doesn't feel as well balanced as the iPhone, S7, or HTC 10.\n\n\nMy conclusion: the phone's emphasis on photography is really undermined by the screen.  LG did great with screen quality in the G3 as one of the first QHD phones (trailing just behind Oppo) and it had decent color accuracy. They don't seem to learn from their successes or their mistakes.  Unless LG can push an update that addresses the color temperature, I won't buy it. The retention issue also causes me to question the quality of their components.  As /u/wilsonm0624 mentions, the blue color temperature may be intentional to prevent image retention.

The phone features the Qualcomm Aqstic audio codec, designed to deliver high dynamic range and high-resolution playback up to 192kHz/24bit to create a remarkable audio experience designed to match the demands of the modern audiophile.*\n\n[HTC 10 press release](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/snapdragon/2016/06/02/qualcomm-aqstic-sets-new-standard-audiophiles)\n\n*there has been no shortage of smartphones featuring Qualcomm Aqstic, including the HTC 10 and Xiaomi Mi5, powered by the Snapdragon 820 processor.*\n\n*The Qualcomm Aqstic audio codec has an integrated DAC (Digital-to-Analog) converter that supports up to 192-kHz/24-bit playback. This is a high-resolution standard that recording studios use to master tracks\u2014it\u2019s how you produce that pure listening experience that satisfies even the most sophisticated ears.*\n\n*Many aspects contribute to the ideal audio experience. Once the analog signal is converted by the DAC, it still needs to be amplified for the headphone experience. The Aqstc audio codec is designed to deliver the amplification performance that is usually captured by impressive SNR and THD+N numbers. For audio geeks, SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and THD+N (Total Harmonic Distortion + N) are specs that determine the dynamic range and signal purity.*\n\n*With the SNR at 115db on the Aqstic codec, you\u2019re getting the best dynamic range\u2014one where you can feel the dramatic change of volume and emotion of something as beautiful as Beethoven\u2019s Third. Ultra-low THD+N at -105db means that the tone of the instruments and vocals you\u2019re hearing is a faithful reproduction of the recording, and no additional noise or signal is needed to give it the most authentic sound reproduction.*\n\n*The Aqstic audio codec also supports dual oscillators; the dual-clock design supports sampling frequencies 44.1kHz and 48kHz independently so your music files can be processed at native sampling rates without any conversion.*\n\n*The Aqstic smart PA (Power Amplifier) is another piece engineered to deliver even more oomph to your external speakers. Your music can be loud and crystal-clear thanks to the wide dynamic range and low noise floor on the smart PA. It also features Speaker Protection that protects your speakers from damage when pushing volumes levels beyond normal range.*", "id": "d991eye"}, {"comment": "I've heard people who have both say the Pixel can't compete with the HTC 10 on audio.

But, I'm going to go ahead and explain.  \n\nPressure, as you hopefully know as a fellow engineer, is equal to stress which equals Force/Area(perpendicular to the applied force).  A capacitive touch screen can only measure whether or not a [finger] is in contact with it and its location.  And based on some measurements of resistance and current, you can do some fancy math and also determine area of contact.  The only other thing you can measure to assist in the aid of a simulated 3D touch is time.  Your method would have to determine pressure as a function of change in area over change in time.  You would have to derive this relationship based on a calibration (which you mentioned).  So this in theory could work, but from what I can see in the developer settings you are only getting about 4 different values of pressure based on input, and it flies through them with very little change in pressure, so it couldn't be used to provide a good quality 3D touch experience anyways without messing with drivers.\n\nUltimately, the best way to do it was done by Apple.  Their method uses the function that Stress = F/A = E*e(epsilon).  Where e is strain, which as you also hopefully know is dL/L.

While not ACTUALLY measuring the pressure you're applying, it's applying varying numbers that directly correlate to how hard you're pressing on the screen.\n\nRegardless of whether or not actual pressure is calculated, we have created an easily distinguishable, qualitative representation for varying degrees of pressure, which is all you need to simulate the same process.", "id": "cxrvx9b"}, {"comment": "There will be way too much variability.

And again, I'm not trying to emulate pressure, I'm emulating \"push screen harder, see message popup\". \n\nThe beauty of programming is you don't need to emulate the exact model, as long as you can find another way to emulate the same result. And that's what happens. As the area of the point of contact increases to a certain threshold, the message preview pops up. \n\nIt's confusing me how this is being made much more confusing than it needs to be.\n\nLiterally all you need to do is record the area of the touch point the second you put your finger on the message subject.\n\nWhen the area increases to a certain threshold (call it 15% larger than it was before) the process is notified, and the message preview shows up.\n\nOnce you remove your finger from the screen, all saved variables are cleared, and the process awaits the next time you touch the screen.

That's basically the major flaw, otherwise for most people the usability is sufficient. I can think of a couple ways to fix this:\n\n1. Make iMessage cross-platform outside of the Apple ecosystem.

It uses your phone number as an identifier. This made sense back in the day with limited text messages, but... why does SMS/MMS need that?\n\nI'm confused about what you're asking. SMS/MMS uses phone numbers as identifiers because it's a carrier service. And even if it wasn't, what would be wrong with using phone numbers as an identifier? It's a unique thing that everyone has, and the concept of phones in general will remain massively popular for quite some time into the future. Whatsapp also uses phone numbers as identifiers because it's a simple method of unique identification. You don't need to remember a phone number anymore, because we have ways to just store that information now. No matter what the identifier is, you have to ask for it and input it initially, so it makes little difference whether you're inputting a phone number or a username. Plus, usernames are far more difficult to use as *unique* identifiers, especially if you want something professional and presentable to the general public. If you're not the first John Smith on a given service, you have to resort to numbers or other junk to come up with a username. Phone numbers level the playing field.\n\nAnyway, personally, I hope RCS catches on and we'll finally get iMessage features in a truly cross-compatible, absolutely bone-stock protocol. Something like Hangouts would be more cross-platform than iMessage is, but it still wouldn't be as easy to get on board as RCS would.

My argument is as follows:\n\n- Seamless integration just keeps SMS alive. Let's kill it already. Very few people out of the US use it that religiously, and it's because of iMessage that iPhone users continue to send Android users SMS. Would this be potentially mitigated by having everyone on iMessage? Perhaps, but how do you accurately predict when an SMS might or might not go out? You have no control of the fallback especially if one user decides to opt out of iMessage in your group chat.\n\n- Different methods of messaging have different meanings. For instance, my friends message on WhatsApp and Hangouts a lot, but we SMS when its serious or we need someone's immediate attention. \n\n- That whole switching to Android and iMessage hell. Honestly, some if it is Apple's fault, but at the same time that's what you get when you want seamless integration. Look at it this way. Alice@gmail.com is communicating with Bob@gmail.com almost like a chat. Bob's email gets hacked. Alice continues sending messages to Bob's old email. Bob gets Bob2@gmail.com and emails Alice. As long as Alice continues on the new thread, Bob gets the new messages; otherwise its hell. Well the same applies here. How does Apple know you lost your phone? Or you switched to Android? It's not that simple. I asked the same questions when CyanogenMod rolled out WhisperPush which was even worse. No de-registration and its aimed at a group that flashes nightlies like no other. What happens when I do a full wipe? They took forever to even come out with a de-reigster tool and even now its some hidden site that I have to dig real hard for.\n\n- Hangouts ESPECIALLY has had its roots as Gchat, which many users use as an IM form because they just leave their Gmail open at work. That's different from mobile chat like WhatsApp or iMessage where most users are primarily on their phones, and so have quick responses. If you look at the few Hangouts chats I have open today, there's hundreds of messages, sometimes in blocks. That would be a pain in the ass to deal with on the phone. That might be more of a why Hangouts has struggled over the years, and interestingly enough how WhatsApp has been so popular despite being a single-device app. People know how to get ahold of you.

DayDream certification as the 6P and 5X lack the sensors).\n\nBut also as a 6P owner its frustrating that there have been demos of Googles Assistant on the 6P (like the IO demo's obviously come from the 6P, as I would say the likelihood of there being a working Pixel units that early on is extremely low), and there were even talks of Google employees running a 7.1 build with Assistant to showcase features at the #madebygoogle event, so the hardware is obviously capable of running it. In this case it's more that Google wants Pixel exclusivity for Assistant, and therefore the 6P and 5X users have been shafted halfway through their product cycle.\n\nHowever, in saying that, I watched the #madebygoogle event, and there was never anything that explicitly said  *\"the Nexus' are not getting Assistant\"*, it said that *\"the Pixel phones will be the first phones launching with Assistant.\"* The same way that the V20 was *\"the first phone launching with Nougat.\"* Yeah, there are the 6P and 5X that are going to get Nougat before the V20 is released, but they weren't \"released\" with it. So arguably in the same way we may see Assistant and the rest with 7.1 on the 6P and 5X, but the Pixels will be the first to \"launch\" with it.\n\nAlthough, the Android Police changelog for 7.1 does explicitly say that Assistant is a Pixel exclusive, although I don't really know how it's going to work for current users in the way of Google Now. All Google Now branding has been gone, so features like Now On Tap and such, are they just going to remain in their current sense, surely not. For Google to see *\"a world where Assistant is accessible from anywhere\"* it needs to be available on something other than 2 Pixel phones, and the Google Home.\n\nEDIT: I would also say that Pixel C users are feeling especially shafted, since they are \"Pixel\" users in every way, yet there seems to be no indication that they are going to get any of these Pixel exclusive features.\n", "id": "d8gasxe"}, {"comment": "My point was that they've not been slighted.

But we have seen proof of the 2015 car running Android Auto, works fine, not a hitch at all, but instead ~~Google~~ the manufacturer is just saying no fuck you buy the 2016 one or don't have Android Auto. While it might change or whatever may happen, right now that looks to be how it is.\n\nI would totally understand if they said hey look Assistant/Auto (going along with your example) needs x, y and z hardware components to work, and the 2015 Nexus'/2015 cars do not have y, therefore they are not going to be able to have access to Assistant. But like I said they've actually shown demo's of it on the 6P/2015 model, and then now they are just not releasing it because buy the 2016 model.\n\nWhile it is just business, it's not the best goodwill that they're going to create for customers.
