After your windshield is warm from blowing the heater on it, the thin frost disappears pretty quickly but you definitely don't want to hit your windshield with the wiper juice as you approach an intersection or take a turn or something.\n\nThat said it is possible to defrost your windshield more quickly using wiper juice.  Here's how:\n\n(1) Idle engine until you're getting some heat from the blower.  Set blower to max heat, full blast, full windshield.  You could also run your rear defroster even if the rear window is OK already; the additional load on the engine will help it heat up a tiny bit faster, and having a warm rear windshield is good.\n\n(2) Run your wipers and squirt some juice.  It will melt the frost.\n\n(3) Keep your wipers running constantly and keep squirting small bursts of juice to work through melting the frost.\n\n(4) Once all the original frost is melted, stop squirting but let your wipers keep running.

Diesel relies on compression to ignite (think of it as a light oil) where gasoline relies on a spark to ignite the volatile and explosive vapor.   The fuels system will need to be flushed and fuel filter changed and the tank cleaned or at least siphoned dry.\n\nGas is a diesel motor is a whole 'nother problem.  Obviously gas is more volatile than diesel.  Then gas will more than likely detonate in the combustion chamber at the incorrect time and cause severe damage to the motor components.

It took me 28 years but forgiving him was one of the best decisions I ever made and has taken a tremendous weight off of my shoulders. It's a long story, more than I know how to type out in this response to your post but I'll try my best to describe what I believe and how it works.\n\nI believe the key concept to grasp regarding forgiveness is \"absorption\".  \n\nI believe if you really want to forgive someone then it requires aborbing the wrongdoing that is done to you by displaying two things: \n\n1. Grace, giving them what they don't deserve. \n2. Mercy, not giving them what they do deserve.\n\nThis means when my dad shouts obscenities at me my response had historically ben shutting down and repressing how much it hurts, angers or saddens me. However, now I find myself responding with patience, displaying the aforementioned grace and mercy:\n\n1. I display grace in the form of compassion, in that I wonder what led him to this place in his life that he would he would think he needs to scream at his children? The phrase,  \"Hurt people, hurt people\" is true. What hurt did my dad go through and how can I, by extending grace to him in his failings, hope to see my dad come out of such a dark place? Without showing my dad grace in his mistakes I have no hope of our relationship improving or healing.\n2. I extend mercy to my father because I've made the conscious effort to not hold his wrongdoing against him but instead to use it as fuel to better love him as his son in hopes that one day we might reconcile and actually have a healthy father-son relationship. When my dad fails me, if I always gave him what he deserved then it would mean I didn't talk to him anymore and our relationship would cease. I don't want that, I don't want my dad to be my enemy\n\nI believe that by absorbing the failures and wrongdoing of your \"enemies\" and in response extending grace and mercy you can forgive them and improve your relationships.\n\nI think you can forgive someone even if they never change. However, reconciliation isn't possible unless both parties are involved. So to conclude with my same example, my Dad might always be the same way and we may never reconcile but I don't have to carry around the weight of bitterness towards him."], [18, "It's not your fault."], [16, "Forgiveness isn't about the other person, it's about you.

The first is a short term fix, and it's one that has come to me second hand. Consider the \"enemy\" and what this person has done to wrong you. Then consider what kind of apology you want that person to give you. Not just having that person say 'sorry'. Consider the specific words you want that person to say, the specific things you want that person to apologize for. In a nutshell, imagine the perfect apology. What would that person have to say to you to make you completely forgive him or her?  \n\nOnce you have considered that, write it down. Then, you will take that paragraph and visualize that person giving that apology to you. Fully immerse yourself into this visualization. Daydream it, and fall deeply into this daydream. Let the picture in your mind be as clear as if it you are simply remembering something that happened yesterday.  \n\nAnd then, wake up from this dream.  \n\nTest subjects who underwent this type of visualization reported stronger feelings of wellbeing afterwards. It makes sense: an apology does not change the person, the listener or the situation. Not in any physical, 'real' way. But we often take an apology as evidence of some kind of internal change, whether or not that internal change has actually occurred or not.  \n\nLike I said, it is something that I heard second hand, and is not something I have used often.  \n\nThe second strategy is to practice a kind of meditation. I don't like the word meditation, because it has a lot of connotations attached to it. Instead, think of it just as taking control over your thoughts. Our minds can often be bedlam. Intrusive thoughts randomly pop in and out. A weird, dark urge beckons you in front of an oncoming train, or off the ledge of a balcony. Cringeworthy moments in our past suddenly pop into our minds for no reason. Temptation, obsession and addiction smolder and burn.  \n\nBut you can get ahold of your mind, and tamp down the strange, impulsive and multitudinous voices that populate it (including the ones that keep you ruminating on this enemy). Practice thinking about nothing. Practice thinking about the thoughts that pop into your head. Practice by letting go.  \n\nYou'll be bad at it at first. But keep practicing. Keep letting go. Eventually, one day, you will be able to take the transgression, pick it up with your fingers, along with the pain that it has caused you, and you can look at it and decide whether to keep it, or whether to toss it aside. Pain may be all you have left of your interaction with that enemy.

Don't look at what they did as right or wrong/good or bad, but just what caused them to do that.

I have to stop other people from gossiping about him with me, because it just gets me going again. \n\nSometimes i just have to let the anger pass. That's tricky, because it's a hair's difference from justified anger and bitterness. Anger has a job to do, but then You have to de-escalate yourself. You don't have to excuse their behavior or wrongdoing. Forgiveness isn't denial; it's accepting the price for someone else's sin. That's why it's called \"being the bigger person\".

It took me many years of introspection and time away from those people and I eventually came to the conclusion that I deserve to be happy and unburdened.\n\nI realized that the reason I held on to such a \"grudge\" for lack of a better word is because I felt that in order to forgive someone, I had to reconcile what they had done to wrong me. I had this idea in my head that forgiveness meant absolving them of their shitty behavior or hurtful actions, pretending it never happened, that people who deserved forgiveness were people who apologized or at the very least felt some remorse, and that as long as I held on to my anger or resentment, they weren't \"off the hook\" for what they'd done.\n\nSo, instead of viewing forgiveness as symbolically saying \"It's okay that you did this to me and never acknowledged your wrongdoing or apologized for hurting me.\", I had to consciously re-learn what it meant and say, instead, \"You fucked up, your actions, intentionally or not, hurt me, I've felt my feelings about it and maybe your behavior still affects me, but I'm not going to let anger and resentment eat away at me as well. I no longer care whether you feel remorse, I forgive you.\" \n\nI never had to confront people with this, I did have to say it out loud to myself a few times, but it has helped me immensely in letting go of pain that I was unnecessarily causing myself. My emotional investment is valuable to me, and I get to decide what I spend my time caring about. I decided I no longer have the time to agonize over whether the people who abused me in my past feel sorry for what they did, because I've left them behind and it's up to them to decide what kinds of people they'll be going forward. It's up to me to heal as a person and treat myself and others with respect.\n\nI also realized that I'm an adult and a free person and I don't have to associate with people who do shitty things to myself and others. I may have to work with these people, be related to these people, or be in the same room with them, but I don't have to let them into my life and invest myself in their actions. \n\nThis isn't a perfect solution, and it's not easy.

In your dream some thing *accepts the role* of being *the bad guy* and does something horrible in the dream to make you hate that guy. Then, you wake up from that dream just as angry as while you were asleep. \n\n\nLook back and analyze the bad guy character. First, that character is just a manifestation of your mind in your sleeping dream, and/or the dream of reality. That Character is volunteering to do something shitty and evil in *your* dream, in *your* mind, in order for you to feel and experience emotions. Anger, or fear and bravery when confronting your enemy, or satisfaction (or possibly the lack of) when being victorious over your enemy are all *feelings*. For some reason, this is what reality is attracted to creating, an illusion to manifest emotions, vice versa. \n\n\nWe are all reflections of ourselves. The enemy rival is specifically tailored into your reality to invoke an emotion, in order to get a response, to create a story in our lives.  Good and bad are perceptions that are subjective. Your 'bad guy' reflection is a reflection of your personal beliefs, hence why the arch enemy is so good at drawing out emotional responses in you. \n\n\nWhat needs to be reminded to ones self is it is just a dream no matter how real it is. Those bad guys, politicians, and other things that are so obviously ridiculous are all there in your dream to create a narrative, a story, or *a human experience for you, as a spirit*\n\n\nHow to forgive: \nThere are only two beliefs here. The Bad Guy in your dreams is either you, or it is not. If it is you, then you are creating your own story obviously. If it is not, then it is an external *entity, who has willingly chosen to be a bad guy in your movie for you to play in so you can feel like the good guy.* Which means, that bad guy who does such an amazing job at pissing you off should receive an Emmy award for best actor for playing the role as the evil doer in your movie. \n\nLife is as magical as it is scientific, it will play both cards to shape your reality to extract the most emotional response, good or bad, it is perception. \n\nHow to remove the 'bad guy'\nIf the bad guy is a reflection of you, you must learn something from them, or about yourself. That bad guy is a concept, if you remove it from you reality, for example, by moving to another city. Another 'bad person' will appear in your new environment, until you have solved or accepted whatever lesson is to be learnt from that experience. \n\nIf you ask the bad guy \"are you real?\", it will likely use whatever beliefs you have to say yes. It may respond with intimidation techniques to distract your thought process of 'is it even real?' to 'uh oh, fight or flight!'. If it were to tell you \"no, I am not real, just a figment of your imagination\", your story would stop being believable. It is like you as Luke asking Vader, \"are we in a movie?\". It would destroy the movie, like it would with a viewers reality. \n\nPeople are saying it is not your fault, *it is your fault*, everything is. As a spirit having a human experience, you are responsible for everything in your movie. With that perspective comes power and responsibility, One has the capacity to change things in ones own reality. Maybe with this perspective you can see life more as a game, and shift your focus to 'How to win' this game, and not be worried, angry, or scared.\n\nYour options are infinite, meditation is a place to start.

How do I love someone who lacks love for me or intends to do me harm?\n\nHis answer was startling to me. He said \"give freedom, liberate them\".\n\nEssentially, if you perceive something or someone to be wrong in anyway, concede them freedom to be wrong, and even surrender yourself to their freedom, if it has been transgressed already. If it happened, you allowed it to happen. If you were some where else it wouldn't happened the way it did, so it was your will to allow that person to wrong you! to free yourself of any anguish caused by their actions, concede that person your intentional consent for them to have their freedom, even if it means they could potentially do you wrong again! \n\nNow your own freedom is yours to decide if you allow it to happen in the future again, but by removing all notion of control over that person, be in in guilt, moral, emotional, financial or any type of debt, that person is no longer a personal issue. they are free to do as they wish.

You have to compromise at some level. whatever wrong was done to you will never be undone in the past, you can however, undo what damage it is still doing this very moment. Its a mental framework, you need to build an internal moral net for your thoughts, to have a floor to land on and argue yourself out of the downward spiral when you feel yourself going down that path.\n\nAll the points I made about personal freedom are simply a thought exercise in 'I wouldnt do to them what I dont want done to me\". If you were wronged, would you say you wanted to be wronged against? probably not. thus, you would not want to have your freedom transgressed. You would say 'no' now that you know the negative outcome that has already transpired, but you likely had something else you were gambling on back when the even happened that made you decide it was worth risking the negative outcome. It didnt play out the way you wanted it to. nothing is perfect and nothing is guaranteed. You lost that time. Youre still sulking over that time you lost, and that just prolonges your emotional 'death'. Youre commiting yourself to purgatory for not giving up on your loses and stopping throwing good money after bad.\n\nBack to the freedom thought. Knowing that you would not want to be wronged, would you then find it fair to wrong another person? Even if it was the person that wronged you? Wouldn't that make you just as bad as them, and thus both deserving of your masochistic exchange in punishments? that's the key to the 'the greater man forgives first'. THAT is why he is the greater man, because he is aware that if he forgives first, he frees HIMSELF from guilt. The wrong in the past is not fixed, but THATS OK! you aren't living in that past anyhow! this requires focus on time, you must be aware of the passage of time for this thought exercise to work.

It's a long story, more than I know how to type out in this response to your post but I'll try my best to describe what I believe and how it works.\n\nI believe the key concept to grasp regarding forgiveness is \"absorption\".  \n\nI believe if you really want to forgive someone then it requires aborbing the wrongdoing that is done to you by displaying two things: \n\n1. Grace, giving them what they don't deserve. \n2. Mercy, not giving them what they do deserve.\n\nThis means when my dad shouts obscenities at me my response had historically ben shutting down and repressing how much it hurts, angers or saddens me. However, now I find myself responding with patience, displaying the aforementioned grace and mercy:\n\n1. I display grace in the form of compassion, in that I wonder what led him to this place in his life that he would he would think he needs to scream at his children? The phrase,  \"Hurt people, hurt people\" is true. What hurt did my dad go through and how can I, by extending grace to him in his failings, hope to see my dad come out of such a dark place? Without showing my dad grace in his mistakes I have no hope of our relationship improving or healing.\n2. I extend mercy to my father because I've made the conscious effort to not hold his wrongdoing against him but instead to use it as fuel to better love him as his son in hopes that one day we might reconcile and actually have a healthy father-son relationship. When my dad fails me, if I always gave him what he deserved then it would mean I didn't talk to him anymore and our relationship would cease. I don't want that, I don't want my dad to be my enemy\n\nI believe that by absorbing the failures and wrongdoing of your \"enemies\" and in response extending grace and mercy you can forgive them and improve your relationships.\n\nI think you can forgive someone even if they never change.

The first is a short term fix, and it's one that has come to me second hand. Consider the \"enemy\" and what this person has done to wrong you. Then consider what kind of apology you want that person to give you. Not just having that person say 'sorry'. Consider the specific words you want that person to say, the specific things you want that person to apologize for. In a nutshell, imagine the perfect apology. What would that person have to say to you to make you completely forgive him or her?  \n\nOnce you have considered that, write it down. Then, you will take that paragraph and visualize that person giving that apology to you. Fully immerse yourself into this visualization. Daydream it, and fall deeply into this daydream. Let the picture in your mind be as clear as if it you are simply remembering something that happened yesterday.  \n\nAnd then, wake up from this dream.  \n\nTest subjects who underwent this type of visualization reported stronger feelings of wellbeing afterwards. It makes sense: an apology does not change the person, the listener or the situation. Not in any physical, 'real' way. But we often take an apology as evidence of some kind of internal change, whether or not that internal change has actually occurred or not.  \n\nLike I said, it is something that I heard second hand, and is not something I have used often.  \n\nThe second strategy is to practice a kind of meditation. I don't like the word meditation, because it has a lot of connotations attached to it. Instead, think of it just as taking control over your thoughts. Our minds can often be bedlam. Intrusive thoughts randomly pop in and out. A weird, dark urge beckons you in front of an oncoming train, or off the ledge of a balcony. Cringeworthy moments in our past suddenly pop into our minds for no reason. Temptation, obsession and addiction smolder and burn.  \n\nBut you can get ahold of your mind, and tamp down the strange, impulsive and multitudinous voices that populate it (including the ones that keep you ruminating on this enemy). Practice thinking about nothing. Practice thinking about the thoughts that pop into your head. Practice by letting go.  \n\nYou'll be bad at it at first. But keep practicing. Keep letting go. Eventually, one day, you will be able to take the transgression, pick it up with your fingers, along with the pain that it has caused you, and you can look at it and decide whether to keep it, or whether to toss it aside. Pain may be all you have left of your interaction with that enemy.

I had this idea in my head that forgiveness meant absolving them of their shitty behavior or hurtful actions, pretending it never happened, that people who deserved forgiveness were people who apologized or at the very least felt some remorse, and that as long as I held on to my anger or resentment, they weren't \"off the hook\" for what they'd done.\n\nSo, instead of viewing forgiveness as symbolically saying \"It's okay that you did this to me and never acknowledged your wrongdoing or apologized for hurting me.\", I had to consciously re-learn what it meant and say, instead, \"You fucked up, your actions, intentionally or not, hurt me, I've felt my feelings about it and maybe your behavior still affects me, but I'm not going to let anger and resentment eat away at me as well.

Then, you wake up from that dream just as angry as while you were asleep. \n\n\nLook back and analyze the bad guy character. First, that character is just a manifestation of your mind in your sleeping dream, and/or the dream of reality. That Character is volunteering to do something shitty and evil in *your* dream, in *your* mind, in order for you to feel and experience emotions. Anger, or fear and bravery when confronting your enemy, or satisfaction (or possibly the lack of) when being victorious over your enemy are all *feelings*. For some reason, this is what reality is attracted to creating, an illusion to manifest emotions, vice versa. \n\n\nWe are all reflections of ourselves. The enemy rival is specifically tailored into your reality to invoke an emotion, in order to get a response, to create a story in our lives.  Good and bad are perceptions that are subjective. Your 'bad guy' reflection is a reflection of your personal beliefs, hence why the arch enemy is so good at drawing out emotional responses in you. \n\n\nWhat needs to be reminded to ones self is it is just a dream no matter how real it is. Those bad guys, politicians, and other things that are so obviously ridiculous are all there in your dream to create a narrative, a story, or *a human experience for you, as a spirit*\n\n\nHow to forgive: \nThere are only two beliefs here. The Bad Guy in your dreams is either you, or it is not. If it is you, then you are creating your own story obviously. If it is not, then it is an external *entity, who has willingly chosen to be a bad guy in your movie for you to play in so you can feel like the good guy.* Which means, that bad guy who does such an amazing job at pissing you off should receive an Emmy award for best actor for playing the role as the evil doer in your movie. \n\nLife is as magical as it is scientific, it will play both cards to shape your reality to extract the most emotional response, good or bad, it is perception. \n\nHow to remove the 'bad guy'\nIf the bad guy is a reflection of you, you must learn something from them, or about yourself. That bad guy is a concept, if you remove it from you reality, for example, by moving to another city. Another 'bad person' will appear in your new environment, until you have solved or accepted whatever lesson is to be learnt from that experience. \n\nIf you ask the bad guy \"are you real?\", it will likely use whatever beliefs you have to say yes. It may respond with intimidation techniques to distract your thought process of 'is it even real?' to 'uh oh, fight or flight!'. If it were to tell you \"no, I am not real, just a figment of your imagination\", your story would stop being believable. It is like you as Luke asking Vader, \"are we in a movie?\". It would destroy the movie, like it would with a viewers reality. \n\nPeople are saying it is not your fault, *it is your fault*, everything is. As a spirit having a human experience, you are responsible for everything in your movie. With that perspective comes power and responsibility, One has the capacity to change things in ones own reality.

Use Dijon mustard and 100% corn flour as your binders instead of the eggs and regular flour. Add whatever else you normally add, but this is the best tasting option (in my opinion). \n\n2. If you are dead set on using 100% beef with no binders place your ground beef into a mixing bowl and blend on low to medium speed for about two minutes. This will cause the hamburger to bind without needing to freeze it. You'll notice immediately that the hamburger will have a more tacky/sticky feel and bind better without breaking apart. \n\nIt's worth a shot, and both will improve the flavor versus freezing the patties.

The amount of CO given off during combustion, in the temperature range of 896 to 986 degrees Fahrenheit, depends on the oxygen to PE monomer ratio. At a ratio of 1:1, a max CO concentration of 9400 ppm (parts per million) was reached after the burning of 10 grams of PE in a 60-cubic-foot closed compartment. But for a ratio of 3:1 oxygen to PE monomer, the maximum CO concentration reached was only about 1410 ppm. Both were achieved in the range of 896 to 986 degrees Fahrenheit after about 20 min. It should be noted that the permissible exposure limit for CO at that time was 50v ppm, and the IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) level was 1500 ppm. In PVC tests, a maximum hydrogen chloride concentration of about 2100ppm was reached after burning of 10 grams of PVC for about 50 minutes, in the range of 500 to 570 degrees Fahrenheit. The permissible exposure limit for hydrogen chloride was 5ppm, and the permissible IDLH level was 100ppm.\"", "id": "cy9iyqf"}], [{"comment": "Teeth, butter knife, pull hard with your fingers, all of these work too", "id": "cy9o982"}], [{"comment": "This legitimately looks like it might be easier than wire cutters", "id": "cy9oa8f"}], [{"comment": "When I first learned this my life changed.\n\nMy work started doing itself, and i Greene rings and God called me a \"cool cat\". \n\nSeriously, for someone who does lots of electrical work on a budget, this is the kitties titties.

This can be serious because cats as a species are very sensitive to dehydration. In fact, that's the reason their pee smells so strongly - their kidneys are adapted to conserve water, and don't excrete it as extravagantly as ours do as they flush out accumulated toxins. Consequently, their urine is very concentrated.\n\n Perhaps your cat is one of the lucky ones whose lactase production hasn't shut down as early as usual, or perhaps you simply don't notice that he is experiencing GI distress, because any vet will tell you that cats are very good at hiding their problems.

But, due to the prevalence of washing systems that *do* damage the cuticle (automated brushing systems, bleaching, high pressure water), European Grade A requires:\n\n> ...'normal, clean and undamaged' shell and cuticle; they will not be washed or cleaned before or after grading, and will be not chilled or treated for preservation...\n\nwhile also saying:\n\n>No epidemiological data on the public health effect of egg washing is available.\n\nThe reason for chilling not being allowed is that if they are ever returned to a warm condition, then, depending on humidity, condensation can collect and lead to things growing on the shell and contaminating the egg. \n\nOutside the realm of microbiological risks, it should be noted that you can expect 7-10 days of freshness from unrefrigerated eggs and 30-45 from refrigerated regardless of cuticle integrity.", "id": "d86rkji"}, {"comment": "Even with washed eggs I get 2 months easily out of eggs and I do water test them before using.
