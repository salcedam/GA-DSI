Let's say he starts kicking your ribs and in the head multiple times and you're now knocked unconscious. Well in a world you've insinuated, DOESNT MATTER you started the fight. So he continues. Kicking punching takes a concrete cinderblock and is about to drop it on your head. I mean after all, you started the fight right? If you wake up and he's about to do that you can definitely shoot him. The thing is that's an extreme example but you have to realize that the only moment that matters is the moment you pulled the trigger. In that EXACT second did you fear for your life? And if you feared for your life and you are not the threat any longer, then you can use deadly force. If the laws weren't set up this way it would break down immediately because of the example I used. You can never tell someone they can't defend themselves SO LONG AS they are not also about to inflict deadly harm as well.

The reason they keep their role quiet is so, in 10 years, when these countries are unrecognizable, they're not held accountable. The exact same open society foundation coordinates and pays full time leaders of BLM. Deray mkesson (leader of BLM) lives in an open society members home in Maryland.

It takes the smart and rich \"chosen\" few to take the reigns and lead society into the next golden era.

They're absolutely not relevant, and would not depict a good view of muslims today seeing as this all happened after 9/11 and 7/7 falllout and the subsequent invasion of afghanistan and Iraq. It seems like this list is a 10 year old copy pasta to crusade against Islam.\n\nYour first source: http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/09/10/muslim-publics-share-concerns-about-extremist-groups/\n\nThis is an article stating how support for terrorism is diminishing. You mention in your bullet points a percentage of people that disapprove and leave the reader to assume that the rest is approving, this is incorrect. Then there is this median % of approval which you present as average, which is obviously incorrect since the countries mentioned do not share the same population amounts so it could never be accurately presented as % of muslims in the world as the poll itself has not presented it like that.\n\nYour second source: http://www.andrewbostom.org/blog/2012/10/31/sixty-percent-of-us-muslims-reject-freedom-of-expression\n\nI see no poll and upon further investigating can't see the actual poll, only the article citing numbers which pretty much oppose earlier polls done in the united states by including one by a source you have mentioned, pew research center.\n\nhttp://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/31/american-muslims-dont-want-shariah_n_1245303.html\n\nYour third source: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/Poll-reveals-40pc-of-Muslims-want-sharia-law-in-UK.html\n\nOnce again, I'd like to see a link to the poll as well, besides just the article.\n\nYes, the surrvey says that 20% have sympathy for the \"feelings\" of the bombers but it also says that 99% of the interviewed say the bombers were wrong to carry out the atrocitties so that's 19% of even the people who supposedly have sympathy.\n\nYour fourth source: http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/\n\nStoning has existed long before Islam came to be. It was practiced by the greeks and the jews. It's not a religious problem, it's a problem of having backwards views. People from different parts of the world are not going to come eye to eye with punishment, and law and even values, unfortunately. The quran doesn't even mention stoning once. It's a manmade punishment, that has mostly turned into a political tool today.\n\nYour fifth source: http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4092/europe-islamic-fundamentalism\n\nDon't really have much to say to this one. It's a 5 year study and has links to the direct poll itself. All I'll give you is a quote from the person that conducted the research.\n\n\"Of course, religious fundamentalism should not be equated with the willingness to support, or even to engage in religiously motivated violence.\"\n\nThere is a concensus that integration in Europe has failed, but this is not a failure that you can purely put on the shoulders of immigrants. This is a failure from the European states as well, who did not even have integration programs AT ALL when the immigrants first came over.\n\nYour seventh source: http://cnsnews.com/node/53865\n\nYou LINKED again, an article mentioning but not linking a Pewglobal polling.\n\nWell, don't worry, look I found it: http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/\n\nUnfortunately this poll debunks your stat of 68% of palestinian muslims supporting suicide bombings against civilians. This is 28%. Only a 40% inaccuracy, don't worry. Hell the majority of palestinians even views Hamas negatively. If you want to make an argument at least back up the data you mention in your bullet points.\n\nYour eight source: http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb09/STARTII_Feb09_rpt.pdf\n\nThe populations of these countries denounce attacks on American CIVILIANS. American soldiers are a different case. These countries aren't US allies, some of the governments might be but the populations certainly aren't. If you're American and you pick up a gun and go to the middle-east you'll get shot at, it makes sense doesn't it? Noone and I MEAN noone wants US troops in the middle-east except the Kurds and the US allied governments. What is the point of your article? This is ridiculous. \n\nYour ninth source: http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/14/opinion/main1893879.shtml&date=2011-04-06\n\n1 out of 4 justifies 7/7/ bombings? Interesting, because in an earlier source you mentioned it said 20% sympathizes with, but 99% still reject and condemn the bombings themselves. It almost seems like these polls do not accurately convey the real state of the muslim mindset in Europe. \n\nYour tenth source: http://www.people-press.org/2004/03/16/a-year-after-iraq-war/\n\nMajorities in all four Muslim nations surveyed doubt the sincerity of the war on terrorism. Instead, most say it is an effort to control Mideast oil and to dominate the world.\n\nAgain there is a sentiment here, especially after the invasion of Iraq and the control of oil. These are american soldiers, the consensus among muslim countries is that these soldiers weren't there to bring peace to Iraq but to secure American interests. Which in 2015 we should look at the peace in Iraq where we can see clearly that the country is in more turmoil then ever the moment the US left. \n\nYour eleventh source: http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/1275/Islam/article/detail/1619036/2013/04/22/Zestien-procent-moslimjongens-vindt-terrorisme-aanvaardbaar.dhtml\n\nThis poll was held in Antwerp. It mentions that 10% of Muslim youths in Belgium find terrorism acceptable. Not 16%. This number rises to 16% when you only count the male youths. It's clear you don't understand the language, yet feel confident enough to post stats from this article presented incorrectly. The article also mentions that 8 out of 10 condemn religious extremism and say that groups like sharia4belgium gives them a bad name. \n\nI'm not going to continue from here onwards, because it's too tiring and I've since realized I'm arguing against a decade old copypaste. \"\n\nCopypasta vs Copypasta", "id": "d4sdj7s"}, {"comment": "Wait... this really a copypasta?", "id": "d4se3jk"}, {"comment": "Well, no, not really.

Geessh. "], [56, "[With thanks to snopes.com]:\n\nThe quote was from a 17 November 1998 speech that Hillary Clinton (as First Lady) delivered at a conference on domestic violence in El Salvador. One of the central themes of Clinton's speech was the effect that war had had on that country (the Salvadoran Civil War had ended a few years earlier), specifically in regards to women and children. Clinton referred to women as the \"primary victims of war\" not just in the literal sense of being injured or killed themselves (as civilian non-combatants), but also as being left without the support and care of their male family members and seeing their own children suffer and die:\n\n\"The experience that you have gone through is in many ways comparable to what happens with domestic violence. Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children. Women are again the victims in crime and domestic violence as well. Throughout our hemisphere we have an epidemic of violence against women, even though there is no longer any organized warfare that puts women in the direct line of combat. But domestic violence is now recognized as being the most pervasive human rights violation in the world. Here in El Salvador, according to the statistics gathered by your government, 1 in 6 women have been sexually assaulted and the number of domestic abuse complaints at just one agency topped 10,000 last year. Between 25 and 50 percent of women throughout Latin America have reportedly been victims of domestic violence.\n\nThe problem is all pervasive, but sometimes difficult to see. Every country on earth shares this dark secret. Too often, the women we see shopping at the markets, working at their jobs, caring for their children by day, go home at night and live in fear. Not fear of an invading army or a natural disaster or even a stranger in a dark alley, but fear of the very people \u2014 family members \u2014 who they are supposed to depend upon for help and comfort. This is the trust-destroying terror that attends every step of a victim of violence. For these women, their homes provide inadequate refuge, the law little protection, public opinion often less sympathy. That's why we have to say over and over again, as Elizabeth has done and as so many of you have echoed, that violence against women is not simply cultural or a custom. It is simply criminal, a crime. The devastating effects of domestic violence on women are just as dramatic as the effects of war on women. The physical injury, the mental illness, the terrible loss of confidence limits the capacities of women to fulfill their God-given potentials.\"\n\nWhile some might argue that Clinton was inaccurate in labeling women as the \"primary victims of war\" (since the majority of military members are male), a resolution adopted by the United Nation Security Council in 2000 arrived at a similar conclusion, stating that \"civilians, particularly women and children, account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict.\""], [51, "Men are the primary victims of sexism.....it happens to their wives, mothers and daughters."], [39, "What an asinine statement."], [31, "This makes me so mad that she would say that.

One of the central themes of Clinton's speech was the effect that war had had on that country (the Salvadoran Civil War had ended a few years earlier), specifically in regards to women and children. Clinton referred to women as the \"primary victims of war\" not just in the literal sense of being injured or killed themselves (as civilian non-combatants), but also as being left without the support and care of their male family members and seeing their own children suffer and die:\n\n\"The experience that you have gone through is in many ways comparable to what happens with domestic violence. Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children. Women are again the victims in crime and domestic violence as well. Throughout our hemisphere we have an epidemic of violence against women, even though there is no longer any organized warfare that puts women in the direct line of combat. But domestic violence is now recognized as being the most pervasive human rights violation in the world. Here in El Salvador, according to the statistics gathered by your government, 1 in 6 women have been sexually assaulted and the number of domestic abuse complaints at just one agency topped 10,000 last year. Between 25 and 50 percent of women throughout Latin America have reportedly been victims of domestic violence.\n\nThe problem is all pervasive, but sometimes difficult to see. Every country on earth shares this dark secret. Too often, the women we see shopping at the markets, working at their jobs, caring for their children by day, go home at night and live in fear. Not fear of an invading army or a natural disaster or even a stranger in a dark alley, but fear of the very people \u2014 family members \u2014 who they are supposed to depend upon for help and comfort. This is the trust-destroying terror that attends every step of a victim of violence. For these women, their homes provide inadequate refuge, the law little protection, public opinion often less sympathy. That's why we have to say over and over again, as Elizabeth has done and as so many of you have echoed, that violence against women is not simply cultural or a custom. It is simply criminal, a crime. The devastating effects of domestic violence on women are just as dramatic as the effects of war on women. The physical injury, the mental illness, the terrible loss of confidence limits the capacities of women to fulfill their God-given potentials.\"\n\nWhile some might argue that Clinton was inaccurate in labeling women as the \"primary victims of war\" (since the majority of military members are male), a resolution adopted by the United Nation Security Council in 2000 arrived at a similar conclusion, stating that \"civilians, particularly women and children, account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict.\"", "id": "d93gtyh"}, {"comment": "In context it seems apparent that she meant the \"primary victims\" that are not also direct participants.

Equality: All humans are equal before God \u2013 No discrimination is allowed on the basis of caste, race, gender, creed, origin, color, education, status, wealth, et cetera. The principles of universal equality and brotherhood are important pillars of Sikhism.\n\n>2. Personal right: Every person has a right to life but this right is restricted and has attached certain duties \u2013 simple living is essential. A Sikh is expected to rise early, meditate and pray, consume simple food, perform an honest day's work, carry out duties for his or her family, enjoy life and always be positive, be charitable and support the needy, et cetera.\n\n>3. Actions count: Salvation is obtained by one\u2019s actions \u2013 good deeds, remembrance of God \u2013 Naam Simran, Kirtan.\n\n>4. Living a family life: Encouraged to live as a family unit to provide and nurture children for the perpetual benefit of creation. (as opposed to living as a wild hermit, which was, and remains, a common spiritual practice in India.)\n\n>5. Sharing: It is encouraged to share and give to charity 10 percent of one\u2019s net earnings.\n\n>6. Accept God\u2019s will: Develop your personality so that you recognise happy event and miserable events as one \u2013 the will of God causes them.\n\n>7. The four fruits of life: Truth, contentment, contemplation and Naam, (in the name of God).\n\n>**Prohibited behavior**\n\n>1. Non-logical behavior: Superstitions, or rituals which have no meaning, such as pilgrimages, fasting and bathing in rivers, gambling, worship of graves, idols or pictures, and compulsory wearing of the veil for women, are prohibited.\n\n>2. Material obsession: (\"Maya\") Accumulation of materials has no meaning in Sikhism. Wealth such as gold, portfolio, stocks, commodities, properties, et cetera, will all be left here on Earth when you depart. Do not get attached to them.\n\n>3. Sacrifice of creatures: Sati \u2013 Widows throwing themselves in the funeral pyre of their husbands, the act of slaughtering lambs and calves to celebrate holy occasions\n\n>4. Non-family oriented living: A sikh is encouraged not to live as a recluse, beggar, monk, nun, celibate, or in any similar vein.\n\n>5. Worthless talk: Bragging, gossip and lying are not permitted.\n\n>6. Intoxication: The consumption of alcohol, drugs, tobacco, or other intoxicants is prohibited.\n\n>7. No priestly class: Sikhs do not have to depend on a priest for any of the functions that need to be performed.\n\n>8. Eating meat killed in a ritualistic manner (Kutha meat): Sikhs are strictly prohibited from eating meat killed in a ritualistic manner (such as halal or kosher, known as Kutha meat ), or any meat where langar is served. In some small Sikh Sects, i.e. Akhand Kirtani Jatha eating any meat is believed to be forbidden, but this is not a universally held belief. The meat eaten by Sikhs is known as Jhatka meat.\n\n>9.

Liberals don't care about muslims above all these other groups (women, gays, etc). Liberals don't care about muslims at all. \n\nLiberals care about *virtue signalling*. Muslims are just a tool to them, the actual goal is *appearing to be more tolerant, open-minded, benevolent, and wise than others*. \n\nThe key word here is *appearing*. What liberals get out of being liberal is a smug inner glow of moral and intellectual superiority. It doesn't matter if they *are* moral at all, educated at all, wise at all. What matters to them is feeling that way. \n\nThat's why no matter how much shit the muzzies blow up, the liberals will always race around assuring us that Not All Muslims Are Like That, while paying to lip service to the idea of outrage at the actual atrocity, then quickly moving on. Expressing outrage and anger, *no matter how appropriate*, is not an opportunity to appear wiser, calmer, and more virtuous than others. Repeating endlessly that \"it is more complicated/nuanced than that\" is such an opportunity. \n\n\"It's complicated\", said quickly and in different ways, creates the impression of having nuanced and sophisticated views without the actual burden of expressing any such thing in a clear and understandable way. \n\nExpressing a desire for peace creates the impression of being benevolent without the burden of actually having deal with the messy and often malevolent world in order to bring any real peace about. \n\nWhat liberals do not understand is that:\n\n* Virtue does not come from the desire to appear virtuous. \n* Virtue does not even come from the desire to *be* virtuous. \n* Virtue comes from the desire to improve the lot of others, and the willingness to make personal sacrifices to do so. \n* Those sacrifices *often include* willingness to *look like the bad guy*. \n\n\n\n", "id": "d6a584c"}, {"comment": "Wow!

There were protesters hanging over balconies demanding to know why there were only white people on stage, femi-nazis with identical Rachel Maddow haircuts in the front row screaming questions but not accepting answers, and most famously, the chick you see here swinging those meaty drumsticks like she\u2019s trying to tackle a Black Dahlia Murder song in expert mode on a RockBand drum set.

Literally there's something called agency, selling drugs is illegal. You're right white do do more drugs than blacks but blacks sell it wayy more than whites do. So guess what when you know that the majority off drug dealers are black you're going to go after that demographic, because that's where you'll most likely find the the drug dealers. Like I said before they didn't get arrested for be black but for breaking the law. None of them would be in jail for breaking the law.

Like are you joking? Do you know your history literally at all? The irish and italians were famous for extreme violence and alcoholism back then, mostly for the same reasons blacks have those things today. Ostracization from regular american society, segregation into ghettos and slums, and discrimination at every level from schools to jobs. All these things they faced, blacks face today. Not to mention the murder rate back then was multiple times what it is today. You literally just proved my point. It took the irish 100 years before they really assimilated, blacks have only been technically free in this country since the 1960s. \n\nSaying 'they shouldnt commit crimes or do drugs, thats it!' just ignores any reasons or factors why they commit those crimes.

It's a matter of how many black people get shot relative to their population. \n\nThere actually is an issue and that's why the media covers it. Sadly, the media puts a different idea into people's heads.\n\nDo ya fuckin' research.\n\nEdit: Guys... 26% make up people living in poverty. Where do you think the crime is happening? \n\nBlacks are 28% of crime. That goes hand in hand with the 26% living in poverty.\n\nThe issue is that 12.2% of them make up the countries population. So then why is more of their population commuting crimes? Because more of them are living in poverty. They can't leave those shitty towns because they're poor, which means their education sucks, which means their jobs will be shit, which means they'll be poor, which means their education sucks since it can't afford resources...\n\nDo you see the cycle?\n\nOh and by the way. For the 9,390,473 arrests in 2012, 2,640,067 were black people. That's a tiny bit over 28%. White arrests were more than double that but that's okay because that's in line with the relative connection to how many white there are in the country. \n\nThe issue is that the black crime, poverty, death rate is double their population while everyone else is closer to being in equal relative standing to their total population. The next worst is the Hispanics and we make up *A LOT* issues when compared to blacks. \n\nEdit 2: I like this subreddit because it's funny but I didn't realize the humor comes from morons... I'm sure you're all down voting me just because everyone else is. Way to follow the assholes instead of reading he facts posted from government and demographic tracking websites... \n\nEdit 3: Sorry for calling people stupid but it's hard to not be frustrated when people end their arguments with \"Blacks commit the most crime so all blacks are the problem\" instead of seeing where those crimes are happening and that blacks make up 26% of poverty with Hispanics behind them (that's Hispanics (any race) not White Hispanic) \n\nFrom what I've got from this is that people are concluding at the wrong moment. After you find out that blacks commit some of the highest crime relative to their general population you'll see the problem. Most have concluded that the problem is blacks people and not their environment which is poor and has bad education. Again 26%. \n\n[This](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf) has been causing a lot of arguments. I don't say debates as people are very... Opinionated. \n\nI've gotten my data from .gov sites and the FBI's site but I'm too lazy to link the rest as I'm on mobile.\n\nEither way, I'm done here. If you can see what black people ARE NOT the *root* of the problem then I encourage you to keep digging. Look at poverty rates and where the crime happens. Then look at well educated states and compare them to other states of similar population/p. density. \n\nAnyway I'm done. I don't wanna be angry at people anymore. I'm not trying to degrade whites either. White crime rate is a healthy number, black crime rate isn't.

Most of them toss their IDs before they get here so there's no way for screening (and in most countries there is none, they are just let in).\nYou add that to the fact that terrorist attacks like that in europe are on the rise in the couple of years mostly. You also add the fact that the more islamic people in an area the more attacks like this happen (I don't have a source unfortunately but you can make your own conclusions with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_and_other_violent_events_by_death_toll#Terrorist_attacks and this http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/ ).\nSo it's not a **direct** result really.

We're just against taking in absurd amount of immigrants, without any checks, giving out welfare left and right, when they are an obvious and current threat to the values of most European countries and to European people. Also we're against taking in islamic immigrants and letting them create political parties that advocate sharia law, for fucks sake. And that's what this \"refugee crisis\" really is. It's just slowly allowing more and more muslim jihadists into our homes and allowing them to do whatever they like. Soon they won't even need to use force, they will democratically choose their own parties and impose legally sharia if we don't do something about this.\nEkhm... so yeah, it's not a direct result, it's an indirect result.

Some people make the argument that women make less money on average than men, [but that point is debatable when you look at the details](http://www.payscale.com/gender-lifetime-earnings-gap). At the very least, it's not a severe income gap.\n\nIn general, I would say a lot of legitimate issues are more subtle and involve complex social dynamics, and therefore they are more difficult to discuss. For instance, women are over-sexualized in the media and generally are expected fulfill a certain archetypal role in society. Not that this argument is invalid, but it's not fair to make this argument without acknowledging the fact that men go through their own form of stereotype oppression. After all, if we even so much as walk onto a playground without bringing our kids with us then we are given the stare down like we are creeps. In general, we are expected to be more masculine and less emotional. Not that this form of gender discrimination doesn't exist, but it does go both ways.\n\nHonestly, I think the biggest issues with gender inequality today problems that men face. For instance, why is that fathers by default receive only weekend visitations with their children in the event of a divorce? If seeing your kids every other weekend isn't enough, then you're expected to hire an expensive lawyer and fight the order in court. Why is this fair that this is the default arrangement?\n\nAlso, as an anecdotal aside, I would say that I'm absolutely terrified by the trigger-happy obsession we have with rape lately. If a woman were to decide to ruin my life with a false rape accusation, then she could [certainly try it without worrying to much about facing consequences](http://www.cotwa.info/2013/02/woman-jailed-after-11-false-rape-claims.html). It's worth noting that the man in that story was exonerated by security camera footage. Who knows what would have happened had that footage not existed. It's obviously not possible to put a real number on false rape accusations leading to real convictions, but with how sensitive our society is to rape lately it is a bit scary to think about. If you think this is a moot point about gender inequality, this think of this. What would happen if a man were to make false rape allegations against a woman? Do you think it's more or less likely to be taken seriously by the authorities than a woman making a false rape allegation against a man?", "id": "d4lg4wo"}, {"comment": "the media is allowed to portray a woman or man the way they want.\n\nIn pretty much every show and commercial since the 90's the guy is the stupid asshole and the woman in the smartone.\n\nAll of those \"woman issues\" are kind of silly issues.

It's the same reason black people are more likely to be stopped by police and muslims are more likely to be suspected of terrorism.\n\nIts all just different sides of the same coin. Its a problem that goes down to our very humanity and impacts us all. We all feel the negative consequences of it, some of us to a greater extent then others.

It's like generalizing Christians based off of the version from warlords in central Africa. \n\nThe media doesn't really care about covering stories that don't fit their narrative of \"xd religion of peace am I rite Dae Muslims are all terrorists\" which is why you won't hear news stories like 70+ Muslims murdered in a suicide bombing no more than two days ago, nor would you pay any attention to Christians in Africa forcing thousands of people to flee from their homes lest they become sex slaves, child soldiers, shanghaied pirates, etc.\n\nEither way, by your username suggesting you live in the US, perhaps it's interesting to know that you'd be more likely to die by getting eaten by a shark, struck by lightning, hit by a train, gored by a cow, shot with a gun you own, or crushed by a vending machine than being killed in a terrorist attack, and none of those are particularly likely (save one).\n\nAnd the worst part about Islamophobia is that people buy into their bullshit and try and send messages that Muslims aren't welcome... by burning crosses and beating the shit out of Sikhs and any brown person with a beard.

Also any movement that works on race baiting and creating segregation is innately toxic. Black people do have it rough but it's been 150 years since slavery and while social conditioning has changed favorably for them over the past half century their socio-economic status has done the opposite. Since the 70s black children being raised in a single parent household is close to double. The real issue is their lack of positive social structures including family values.

Apparently \"white privilege\" contains some basic knowledge of history as well, since Arabs have been trading slaves long before the white devil got that idea. (Not to mention that white people didn't have to lift a finger enslaving black people in Africa either, since black people were very eager to enslave and sell off the competing tribes.\n\nAlso, what's the deal with caps lock?", "id": "cxwue5e"}], [{"comment": "The guy who pronounces the word says \"mudslime\" lol.

Yes 10 years isn't a long time but for all those assholes who say \"oh it's not ALL of them\" guess what, can you name one terror attack that wasn't Muslims? I can't. I can name some mentally fucked up white people that decided to shoot up some schools and one abortion clinic 2 weeks ago but that's about it. A quick rant here, I also can't fucking stand how the argument shifts from \"it's not all\" to \"maybe they have a mental illness too!\" once it's pointed out 99.9% of attacks are Muslims save the school shootings. If that's the case then a gigantic proportion of that religion is undiagnosed and is extremely gullible. Not to mention, working in psych myself, if you're depressed or psychotic it doesn't automatically mean you're looking to blow up yourself or others. Usually it means you're delusional or you want to sit in bed all day among a variety of other symptoms. I've had clients from all different religions, socioeconomic statuses, ages, etc (based in the US) and not a single one thought it was a good idea to blow up a school or abortion clinic.
