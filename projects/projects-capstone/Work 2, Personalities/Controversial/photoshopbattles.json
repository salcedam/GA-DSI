Next, create the Pale Yellow/Blue stripe pattern by opening a new document (1x10px) and filling the top and bottom half with the respective colours. Put this pattern in your library for later use: [Edit > Define Pattern](http://i.imgur.com/6cHOYCw.jpg), name the fucker [for your own reference](http://i.imgur.com/wQ4Xwub.jpg), then close the document (don't bother saving it).\n\n1. [Duplicate your portrait 4 times in your poster-sized document.](http://i.imgur.com/qfYAhbF.jpg) I'm keeping one original layer for safety and have also added the original Obama poster as a hidden layer so that I can quickly toggle it on and off for reference. Shit's about to get real.\n\n1. Select the bottom-most copy, click [Image > Adjust > Threshold](http://i.imgur.com/JuqpuWq.jpg). You'll want a dark value in the mid to high hundreds, depending on the brightness of your original image. \n\n1. Repeat x 3, every subsequent layer will be lighter/with a lower value \u2014 [I'll stop at the final layer when the details of the eyes are sharp and visible.](http://i.imgur.com/Ww0bIzZ.jpg)\n\n1. To smooth out the edges, use [Filter > Artistic > Palette Knife.](http://i.imgur.com/hkNJljM.jpg) Repeat this for the other 3 layers, fine-tune the filter values for details (don't ask me exactly how, just make it more ... Obama-like).\n\n1. Now, you'll only need the black pixels. Remove the white background with Select > Color Range. Hit delete after selecting the white background with the eyedropper tool \u2014 [or if you're feeling rebellious, select the black pixels and check the \"Invert\" box.](http://i.imgur.com/H8kMr3D.jpg)\n\n1. Repeat this background removal for all 4 layers before colouring.\n\n1. The bottom-most layer will be the stripey one.

I've never seen a retoucher at work, only some tutorials on youtube. Do you guys really know all the values for the panels and features like the back of your hand? I think getting a repeatable and consistent processed look would be a challenge for me cos I learn through errors.\n\nThat's one of the reasons I think I won't cut it for an actual photoshop job. For example, even after years of using blend mode, I can't tell the difference between overlay, screen, soft light, etc. Each time I have to overlay something, I'll toggle through the options one by one while humming \"hello, is it you I'm looking for?\" repeatedly.\n\nAnd since I don't often get to talk to creatives these days: on a scale of Bowie to Rickman, how alive would I be if I stood over your shoulder while you worked and casually remark that \"I have an app on my iPhone for that\"?", "id": "cz00suy"}, {"comment": "You bring up some good points. Knowing what blend mode does what will sink into your brain after 5 or 10 years. Yes I know the numbers and ratios for Caucasian flesh tones (cyan 1/3 of magenta and yellow slightly ahead of M), although that only works for white people. As for the palates I don't use that many compared to a conceptual artist such as yourself. And yes I am quite sure you would tell me there is an app for that for many things I do. Recently I read an article by some Instagram kid who creates great composites that would take me hours. He uses a variety of apps to do it instantly and I bought them all but still haven't opened them. At 46 I am the youngest person in my print studio. You do get set in your ways when you get older although the reason I am still making a nice 6 figure salary while the rest are long gone is because I do keep up with new trends and new tools. It just takes me a while. The thing is, to justify my reputation as a skilled specialist I don't want people seeing me use some app that does the job in two seconds! So there is a fine line there one must balance. One day some whipper snapper like you will catch the attention of my upper management and that will be the end of me. Maybe. The other side of the coin is that I am where I am today not as much for my skills but for the way I look and act and portray myself. Ever see Breaking Bad? Remember how innocent and self conscious Walt was in the beginning compared to how he carried himself at the end? Well I am Heisenburg. Badass, confident, proud, outgoing. Because I know I'm the best and that is what they say about me so everyone knows it is true. \n\nNow, come to my print studio for a few weeks and teach me all your crafty tricks. I will be grateful but then at the end I will have to kill you and dispose of your body.

This tutorial has been lifted and posted elsewhere and the author has ignored my request to credit me\u2014in the meantime you can find the [full tutorial on my own website here.](http://oneksy.com/how-to-create-vintage-hand-painted-effect-with-photoshop/)*\n\nI'll be using [this image](http://i.imgur.com/XAh1Fwm.jpg) as an example, and [this is the end result.](http://i.imgur.com/Ii8p9RL.jpg) After opening image:\n\n1. [Create slight S-curve with curves adjustments](http://i.imgur.com/olEKeFn.jpg) to bring out the contrast between the dark and light areas of the face. If it is a flat or outdoor image, I'll use the dodge and burn tool to create the areas of contrast manually (triangle across the nose bridge and cheekbones, etc), [example here](http://i.imgur.com/g6Gn1lq.gifv).\n\n2. Vibrance and Saturation adjustment [\\(+ Vibrance, - Saturation\\).](http://i.imgur.com/C6DlEC7.jpg)\n\n3. Use the shortcut CMD+J to duplicate the background layer twice, then with the uppermost layer selected add a High Pass effect from the Filters menu [\\(less than 3 pixels radius, just enough to get an outline of the features\\).](http://i.imgur.com/9pmBToE.jpg)\n\n4. Change the blending mode of this High Pass layer to Linear Light. I forgot to take a screenshot, but you should be able to see the image drastically sharpen at the edges. The harsh edges will provide the \"ingredients\" for the swirly paint strokes you will create in the next step.\n\n5. Merge the High Pass layer with the background duplicate below it, then [Filter > Stylize > Diffuse > Mode: Anisotropic.](http://i.imgur.com/B7TWD18.jpg) This is what it looks like now: http://i.imgur.com/a2uc353.jpg\n\n6. Filter > Sharpen > Smart Sharpen to bring out some of the details [\\(100% with low pixel radius\\).](http://i.imgur.com/lyqvSIl.jpg)\n\n7. [Filter > Blur > Surface Blur](http://i.imgur.com/cnTiK0I.jpg) to remove the swirly paint strokes from large reflective areas of the face (cheeks, forehead, etc). \n\n8. Image > Adjustments > HDR Toning to create a slightly overdone [\"Shitty HDR look\".](http://i.imgur.com/dFzqpaZ.jpg) *[EDIT: I'll usually skip this step, unless I want the antique poster look]*\n\n9. [Image > Adjustments > Desaturate HDR layer](http://i.imgur.com/kuxLoTB.jpg), then invert the colours and apply the [Gaussian Blur filter \\(~10px\\).](http://i.imgur.com/xb9qyrP.jpg) Set blending mode to Soft Light.\n\n10. Use curves adjustment to create a [big S-curve on the untouched background layer](http://i.imgur.com/dFAtjDa.jpg) ^hehe, ^big-ass ^curve. CMD+J once more and put it above the \"painted\" layer. [Filter > Other > High Pass between 20 to 50 px.](http://i.imgur.com/4qH1Ft6.jpg) Set blending mode to \"Overlay\" and adjust opacity to between 20 to 50%. This is mainly for eyes and hair detail - I'll usually mask out the other areas with a big soft brush.\n\n11. Change layer opacity of painted layer to between 50 to 80% so you'll end up with: High Pass layer (overlay 20-50%) > Painted layer (50-80%) > High contrast background layer\n\n12. Use it as is, or merge layers and create a cutout with the pen tool with 2px feathering on the edges. [At this point I'll usually add a final colour adjustment to tweak the reds and yellows.](http://i.imgur.com/ZaHWAeo.jpg) Depending on how the final image turns out, I'll often overlay a copy of the shitty HDR layer from step 8 to boost the colours and make it look more unnatural than it already is. \n\n[Quick and dirty gif of the main steps/changes.](http://i.imgur.com/9nJkoDv.gifv)", "id": "d15ot4m"}, {"comment": "You are a master of art.

I corrected exposure, brightness for outside to inside.  I added some yellow color balance for the inside room, and lowered the brightness.  I then cut out the head and lowered the opacity to match up faces, placing the new face over the old till eyes, nose, chin and mouth lined up.  Rotated face, changed scale, and did a minor distortion to correct angle.   After the face was fixed, scaled and aligned, I put it behind the original.   I added a mask to the original and used a gradient brush (set to black) on the mask to let the new face show through where I wanted, blending the old with the new.

And at least some of her visions do come true. For a long time she follows one of the lords of the Kingdom of Westeros, Stannis Baratheon, who has a legitimate claim to the throne but is denied, and who now looks to conquer it militarily. She believes that Stannis is the chosen of her faith, \"Azor Ahai\", and destined to greatness. She posseses magic - the magic of Game of Thrones is not like that of Harry Potter though, but much more like it was thought of in the middle ages, where people believed in curses and such. So she won't be throwing fireballs around any time soon. Many of her spells appears to require sacrifices, ideally \"with king's blood\", which means Stannis' relatives. Sometimes it seems greatly effective, sometimes not. But she is a very convincing person.\n\nThe girl on the right is Shireen, Stannis' daughter. The skin issues on her face are Greyscale, a fictional illness that turns a person's skin to stone and finally turns them into zombie-like monsters, that is deemed to be incurable. But Stannis loved her regardless, hired countless healers, and finally they managed to stop it from spreading further. She truly is important to him.\n\nHis military campaign brings Stannis and the remainder of his family far to the north, and there things turn sour. His army is caught by an early winter as he marches against a castle, many sellswords desert, things look grim.\n\nAt that point Melisandre believes that the best proceeding would be to sacrifice Shireen to the Lord of Light by burning her on a stake, to save the army and ensure victory. Stannis isn't easily convinced, but ultimately agrees.\n\n-----\n\nSo, there's the back story. That's the deal with the fire jokes.\n\nIf you see a \"Ser Davos Seaworth\"/\"The Onion Knight\" mentioned here, he was involved as a friend of Stannis who loved Shireen like his own daughter and hates Melisandre for sacrificing good people to use  blood magic.\n\nIf you see pictures of a terribly old face or an allusion to a necklace: In one scene Melisandre removed her necklace, and it turns out that she is actually like a hundred years old and only keeps her young appearance through magic (apparently aided by that necklace). She's also somewhat of a seducer (with her necklace on though), which she often uses to get to her sacrifices.", "id": "d4rcns8"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rddi4"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4req53"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rf3vr"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rmzu6"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rd5eu"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rm5tt"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rsjyh"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rd52h"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rd9xy"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rg6rq"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rhhsy"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d4rjdo6"}, {"comment": "Whoa!
