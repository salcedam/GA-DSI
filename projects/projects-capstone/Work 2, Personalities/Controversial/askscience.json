On the other hand, obviously they still didn't rate Trump's chances high enough because their prediction stood at 75% for Hillary the night before the election, and Trump ended up winning.\n\nYou can either criticize 538's methodology or their data or both. I've looked at their methodology and I don't see much wrong with it. It's true there are parts that aren't strictly math, they're judgement calls. But those are unavoidable. Maybe someone else could have made better calls, but it would be hard to defend since they don't depend on quantifiable facts but rather on intuition based on experience gained from past elections.\n\nAs for their data, we *know* polls are biased. But biases vary, some pro-Trump, some anti-, so the idea is that they should zero out when averaged. But in this case we see a systemic anti- bias that didn't zero out, if the polls were indeed at fault. This is something the pollsters have to figure out themselves, and it'll take time.\n\nIf it was just 538, I'd say what's the big deal, that's margin of error. After all, the actual results fell well within their fairly narrow confidence intervals. It's not an amazing, astounding surprise if something you assign a 30% probability actually happens. But it wasn't just 538, a lot of people who analyze this stuff made the same prediction, and in many cases, much more extreme than 538.\n\nSo I'd have to say that the better explanation is that while the mathematical probability *slightly* favored Clinton, it *greatly* favored Clinton in the minds of a lot of people talking about these polls. There is definitely something psychological there. Perhaps something that appears outrageous and outlandish to you also appears more unlikely.\n\nOf course, there might have been problems with the polls too. Maybe people didn't like telling pollsters they were going to vote Trump, maybe they lied. Maybe they called themselves \"undecideds\" when they'd already made up their minds to vote Trump.

You work out the electromagnetic field of a moving charge and you find it has two terms: one that is acceleration-independent and another that is acceleration-dependent. The term dependent on acceleration (which scales like 1/r and is responsible for radiation) depends on the so-called *retarded position*. So the effects due to that term do have a speed-of-light delay.\n\nIf the acceleration is zero, then all that survives is a term that depends on the time and constant velocity of the particle in such a way that only the *present position* of the particle matters. It's really just a remarkable coincidence. The message, so to speak, of the field comes from the retarded position of the particle, but the message it's sending out is more or less \"this is where I'm going to be by the time this message gets to you\".\n\nFor gravity, something similar happens. In Newtonian gravity, the field depends only on the (present) position of source particles, and so the \"speed of gravity\" is infinite. In GR, the field depends on position, velocity, acceleration, etc. of the source particles. For particles with no proper acceleration, i.e., in free fall, everything cancels out magically so that the field depends on the present position of the source particles. So it gives the impression that the speed of gravity is infinite in GR also. (It's not though. That would be like deducing that the speed of electromagnetic waves is infinite because the field of a point charge with constant velocity depends on its present position.)\n\n> How could I be pulled to where something would have been, if the object is then stopped before it gets there?\n\nIn that case, the object has undergone a proper acceleration presumably. In the case of a charge moving at constant velocity, the field points toward the present position of the particle. Once the particle stops, the field points in a direction where it would have been until the time it takes for the electromagnetic wave to travel from the charge, at which time the field then does change.\n\n[See this animation](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/field_a.gif) for the electric field of a charge that starts from rest, then suddenly accelerates to some non-zero constant velocity. (The reason the lines bunch up when the particle starts moving is that the magnitude of the field is not what you expect from electrostatics, so that *is* different. But the direction of the field is still dependent only on the present position of the particle.)\n\nFor gravity, this becomes a lot more complicated. What matters is whether the particle has proper acceleration. But if a particle suddenly gains some proper acceleration, there had to have been energy or momentum transfer to do that. That energy-momentum has its own gravitational field, which should be taken into account if you want an answer you know to be consistent with the theory.

If that 1 tonne mass enters the atmosphere at 10 kms^-1 it needs to lose about 50 thousand megajoules of kinetic energy.\n\nNASA dealt with this in several of ways. What you see in film of reentry of, say, an Apollo command capsule, is an ablative material on the outside of the capsule burning away and carrying heat with it.

There is ample evidence that motor skills, which are responsible for speech production, are less elastic after childhood than cognitive skills. It has also been suggested that auditive (and visual) skills fixate over time; I don't know how much proof there actually is.

Every lottery drawing is random, so the numbers that were drawn in the past have no bearing whatsoever on the numbers that will be drawn in the future.  And, statistically speaking, you will lose money playing the lottery in the long run, just like you will with any gambling.  In fact, the lottery has odds many orders of magnitude worse than you'll ever find in any casino game, so it's the fastest way to lose your money gambling.\n\nNow, if you want to pick winning numbers then any methods of picking them will do just fine.  Picking randomly (a \"quick pick\"), picking your birthday, picking numbers that are all sequential (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5), picking only even numbers, picking only odd numbers, and so on all have the exact same probability of winning.  It does not matter what you pick at all in terms of your likelihood of winning.\n\nThat said, if you do win, you split the pot with everyone else that played identical numbers.

The odds of winning the powerball jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338.  Your likelihood of getting struck by lightning is *three orders of magnitude* greater than your likelihood of winning the powerball jackpot.

Alternatively, you can sell this ticket. What would you sell it for?\n\nPurely rationally, you'd have to sell it for $10000 or more. In practice, a player would sell it for something like $8000. This will cost him $2000 in expected value (the \"risk premium\"), but eliminate $20000 worth of risk. \n\nPeople do this sort of calculation all the time; insurance is the most obvious one, but simply choosing a less congested route in traffic would be a more mundane example. Evaluating the *importance* of loss is absolutely essential for conduct of daily life, because it allows us to take risks. Why lottery seems like such a good deal is that the premium to be paid is very small in absolute terms, only a few dollars here and there, which is not an important loss.\n\nFinally, one piece of this puzzle is the social aspect. People love social and exchange games, which can be seen from the popularity of e.g. poker. Also, the excitement from a lottery is a sort of a \"legal high\"; people like to take risks sometimes just for the sake of it.

Every lottery drawing is random, so the numbers that were drawn in the past have no bearing whatsoever on the numbers that will be drawn in the future.  And, statistically speaking, you will lose money playing the lottery in the long run, just like you will with any gambling.  In fact, the lottery has odds many orders of magnitude worse than you'll ever find in any casino game, so it's the fastest way to lose your money gambling.\n\nNow, if you want to pick winning numbers then any methods of picking them will do just fine.  Picking randomly (a \"quick pick\"), picking your birthday, picking numbers that are all sequential (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5), picking only even numbers, picking only odd numbers, and so on all have the exact same probability of winning.  It does not matter what you pick at all in terms of your likelihood of winning.\n\nThat said, if you do win, you split the pot with everyone else that played identical numbers.  So things like birthdays, [numbers in fortune cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerball#Fortune_cookie_payout), and other common numbers that many other people will play will likely result in a lower payout for you *if* those numbers are picked.  But remember, *this has no impact whatsoever on the likelihood of those numbers being picked*.\n\nAs an aside, if you're trying to make money then playing the lottery is worse than simply setting your cash on fire because at least a small fire can be used to perform useful work.

If you made decisions based on probabilities that small, you would live in perpetual fear of things such as lightning strikes, for which you have approximately a 1 in 960,000 chance of being struck by in any given year.  The odds of winning the powerball jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338.  Your likelihood of getting struck by lightning is *three orders of magnitude* greater than your likelihood of winning the powerball jackpot.

The three basic options are absorption, reflection, and transmission. \n\nTake a simple wall for example, which visible light can't pass through. Longer wavelengths can pass through because they're so be it's like the wall isn't even there. Shorter wavelengths can be so small that they pass through the space between atoms. To radio waves or gamma waves, the wall is essentially transparent.\n\nOr here's a fun fact about glass: it's completely transparent for visible light of course, but it blocks/absorbs ultraviolet light. So you normally can't get sunburned behind a window.\n\nConsider a microwave: You know how it's got those little holes that let you see through? The material those holes are punched through is a metal that both visible light and radio waves can't pass through. Well, microwaves are just small radio waves with wavelengths of a couple centimeters. So the holes let you see inside the microwaves, because visible light has no problem passing through them. But the holes are too small for the larger wavelength of microwaves. As far as microwaves are concerned, it's a solid metal sheet that they can't pass through.\n\nThink about X-rays, which are very small wavelength light beyond ultraviolet. We often use these to take images inside our bodies, right? That's because, while our bodies block visible light, x-rays are small enough to pass right through... for the most part. Bones are particularly dense, and so they block x-rays. The result is an image of our skeletons. Radio waves pass through our bodies as well of course, but their wavelength is too large to give a meaningful resolution. It's almost like we're too small for them to see- they just go around us.\n\nHopefully those examples give you a sense of how it works. It all boils down to wavelength (too large and the object won't even be noticed, too small and the light will \"sneak\" through) and the object's material properties (if the light does run into the material, how do the two interact).", "id": "cxsrjhl"}, {"comment": "Another example that works the other way around: \n\nWater will let visible light through (refractive index, n=1.34) but it is very absorbent to microwave frequencies (approximately n=5 to 9, absorption k around 1).

And because the imaginary part, k is high, it means that the water will absorb most of the light that actually enters.", "id": "cxsuiet"}, {"comment": "I'm very confused. You seemed to suggest wavelengths with both higher and lower energy than visible light are small enough to pass through obstacles. Is there a mathematical formula where taking the wavelength of an EM waves and some property of the matter, you can figure out if it's transparent or not?", "id": "cxt4vaw"}, {"comment": "There's no mathematical formula. It comes down to the physical chemistry of the material and the size of the material relative to the wavelength.\n\nTiny radiation light gamma rays are so small they can pass right between atoms, which makes sense. That doesn't mean they *always* pass through everything. It just means they have a pretty good probability of slipping through. On the off chance they do hit some matter they will be absorbed or reflected.\n\nRadio waves are perhaps a bit trickier to explain. Remember that em radiation is basically just an electromagnetic disturbance being propagated through space. They interact with matter simply because of that electrical nature. When a wave runs into matter it interacts electromagnetically with that atom depending on the material's chemistry. For example, [here is how light interacts with water](https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-26eac68cf8e765e80c64ffc1cb560480?convert_to_webp=true). The reasons that light interacts different ways with different materials are very complex, if you can't tell from how seemingly random that chart is. \n\nBut let's focus on radio waves. Turns out that radio waves don't interact much with some materials, like wood. A wall made of wood is simply doesn't mess with the electromagnetic wave as it passes through. Metals however tend to be a different story, basically due to the fact that atoms move freely through metallic materials. When an electromagnetic wave runs into a metal, it gets distorted. The electrons are basically more willing and able to absorb the energy than they are in other materials.\n\nBut there's more to the story- this is where relative size comes into play. Imagine I have a metal plate the size of my fist while a 10 meter radio wave passes by. The metal *does* interfere. But the wave is a heck of a lot bigger than that plate. It's basically the same thing as if I tried to use this plate to stop a wave of water. There's a small local disturbance around the plate, but it's not going to stop the wave or even affect it notably. So the metal does interfere with the radio wave, but not significantly. My antenna can pick up the signal without any problems.\n\nDoes that help?", "id": "cxt7gxe"}, {"comment": "If the em wave can be absorbed, it will not pass. Gases absorb specific wavelengths because of resonance with their electron bands. Metals absorb broader spectrums because the resonant bands are continuous.

You fall through this abyss for a very, very long time.\n> \n> You eventually start to notice that the atmosphere has become thick enough that you can swim through it. It's not quite liquid, not quite gas, but a \"supercritical fluid\" that shares properties of each.

Still glowing white-hot, hydrogen has become so dense as to become a liquid metal.

Beneath you is a core weighing in at 25 Earth-masses, made of rock and exotic ices that can only exist under the crushing pressure of 25 million atmospheres.\n> \n> You check your cell phone to tell you friends about your voyage...but sadly, it melted in the metallic ocean - and besides, they only have 3G down here.\n\n[Permalink to original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3dgt1f/could_you_stand_on_a_gas_planet_or_would_you_fall/ct554ze) by /u/Astromike23 ", "id": "cz6zuyx"}, {"comment": "Not gonna lie, I was pretty proud of that. :)", "id": "cz7d4gl"}, {"comment": "One explanation in here that continues to bug me is the claim that temperature rises because of the pressure.

According to the gas laws, the temperature of a gas will increase when the gas is compressed, but it will Reach thermal equilibrium.\n\nIf you take a mass of gas and decrease its volume while adding/removing no heat, the temperature will increase. This is known as an adiabatic transformation. Note the difference here between heat and temperature, though - heat is really the measure of energy, while temperature is how the molecular speeds are distributed because of that energy.\n\nThe same thing happens in reverse when you use an aerosol spray can - the gas coming out is very cold, even though it has the exact same amount of heat as when it was in the can.\n\n> The temperature rise from the compression of gas as the planet formed should have radiated away long ago, or am I missing something?\n\nFor Jupiter at least, it's large enough that this is still the case. Gravitational compression from formation provides most of the internal heat. As a result, Jupiter shrinks in size about an inch per year, and more and more of the interior turns into degenerate matter (liquid metallic hydrogen).\n\nSaturn also has a source of internal heat, but little of it at this point is from gravitational compression. A far greater fraction comes from separation of hydrogen and helium. Helium is denser, so as it separates out of mixture and moves towards the center, that releases gravitational potential energy, providing a heating source.\n\nThe exterior of Uranus is exactly as warm as we'd expect it to be if only heated by the Sun, so we suspect there's no internal heating. The temperature does rise as you head towards the center, though, due to the adiabatic compression mentioned above.\n\nThe exterior of Neptune, on the other hand, is quite a bit warmer than we'd expect it to be if only heated by the Sun, so we assume there's a pretty serious heating mechanism going on.

In this scenario there is no actual \"stuff\" called dark matter, its an effect, like a form of centrifugal force. However, its a little difficult to claim this as a serious solution as the theory involves a tower of assumptions and (effectively)free parameters, as well as some phenomenological difficulties of its own.", "id": "cxrd2la"}, {"comment": "I might add that the theory that Dark Matter is just ordinary matter in another dimension which can interact gravitationally, but not through any of the other fundamental forces, is appealing but has a major inconsistency with our observation of the effects of Dark Matter. In our universe \"Visible Matter\" forms into gravitationally bound disks. Why is it a disk? Because when all that matter is drawn together by gravity, it tends to bang into other matter and interact electromagnetically, strong forcetically  and weak forcetically (I liked making up that word).  Anyway, we discovered Dark Matter because gravitationally the stars in galaxies act like they're embedded in large sphere/halos of matter rather than than just the disks we can see. If Dark Matter was just ordinary matter in other dimensions with the principle that only gravity can span dimensions, then that other dimensional ordinary  matter would also form disks in its own dimension. Thus, the dark matter mass distribution would be unlikely to show a spherical halo gravitational effect in our own dimension.

We know it's there, but we cannot see it. We can tell that it affects the gravity in our universe, but it doesn't seem to do anything else or have a physical form.\n\nYou are describing a 4D universe where we are limited to a 3D volume in it. You then assume light and other EM radiation is limited to the 3D volume with us (so we cannot see anything outside of our volume) but gravity can interact with things in 4D. But as long as you have the basic rule that dark matter interacts with us by gravity but not by EM fields, then adding the 4D/3D distinction doesn't really add anything. There is no reason, for instance, to think that dark matter shifts around with some sort of complicated dynamics that we could only explain by giving it an extra spatial dimension to move in.\n\nSo you have the right idea that dark matter still tugs on us gravitationally even though we think we can't see it. But this just means that dark matter is interacting via some fields and but not others. For many people this sounds similar to neutrinos, which have some mass-energy but are largely invisible to us.

Perhaps the supermassive black hole at the galactic center, or some other bizarre phenomenon? \n\nAlso, on a related note -- where do all the neutrinos go when they are created by the sun?  And how much mass in neutrinos does the sun generate throughout its lifetime?  Since neutrinos are so incredibly tiny and devoid of mass, they move at (very near) the speed of light.  The tiniest little impulse sends them shooting off in any direction at the speed of light.  So I can see why they are *generated* moving so fast, and why \"fresh\" neutrinos can't explain the dark matter problem.  But can they ever slow down enough to behave like a dark matter halo?

Before we continue, lets discuss why this is. First, since we are dealing with random events, we must ask what we mean by \"determine is fair.\" Due to the events being random, it is possible that a fair die will continually role only a single side, or that a not fair dice will role something that looks fair. So by determine, we must be asking **how many rolls before the dice is fair with probability** *v*. Second, the laws of probability still limit us in providing an answer. To see this we must introduce some terminology. So lets say we roll the dice *n*-times, and we observe the sequence **x**, where I have bolded **x** to reinforce the notion it is a vector consisting of the outcomes of those n rolls. Consider now the probability the dice are fair given a observation **x**, written Pr( fair dice | **x** ). Using [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)\n\nPr(fair dice | **x** ) = Pr( **x** | fair dice ) Pr(fair dice) / Pr(**x**).\n\nThe probability of our observation occurring though is a function not only of the fair dice, but what would happen if the dice were not fair\n\nPr(**x**) = Pr(**x** | fair dice) Pr(fair dice) + Pr( **x** | not fair dice) ( 1 - Pr(fair dice) ),\n\nand no matter the way you attack this problem, you will end up with the conclusion that in order to determine any test such that Pr(fair dice | **x** ) -> 1 you will first need to define the distribution of outcomes of the dice when they are unfair. So determining if the dice are fair or not is impossible without defining the unfair dice. \n\nInstead the best we can do is design a test that minimizes the number of observations (**x**) which are declared fair subject to having probability *v* of labelling a fair dice as unfair. Now why is this the best we can do? Consider that by deciding fair or unfair, in essence we are using a function *k*(**x**) that outputs 0 for fair or 1 for unfair. Now think of the types of errors that can occur, the case where we label an unfair dice as fair, and one where we label a fair dice as unfair. As explained previously, without knowing the distribution of the unfair dice, it is impossible to say anything Pr( k(**x**) = 0 | unfair dice). But, the other error type of deciding a fair dice is unfair, can be defined since it depends only on the test k(**x**) and the distribution of the fair dice which are defined. At this point though, you may ask yourself, should we not try to minimize Pr ( k(**x**) = 1 | fair dice )? Well, yes, but this would be uneven, if we decided all sequences of dice role were fair then Pr ( k(**x**) = 1 | fair dice ) = 0. This solution though is trivial, and does not really provide us with any sort of test approximating if the dice are fair or unfair. \n\nThis is why we want to minimize the number of observations that we label as fair for a given probability of error (*v*). In other words we are creating the most discriminating test possible subject to the constraint that our test will only incorrectly label a fair dice as unfair with probability *v*. While not exactly a satisfying answer to your question, it is the best we can do. [And it is problematic when we try and infer more.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4ao60j/many_scientific_studies_you_read_about_are_hinged/).\n\nNow we discuss this most discriminating of test. As it turns out, this test is a function of the observed seqeunces empirical distribution. The empirical distribution of outcomes, denoted here as P**x**, is an indexing of the relative frequencies of the sides. In other words if side one occurs exactly 10 out of n trials, and side 2 exactly 13 out of n trials, then P**x**(1) = 10/n, P**x**(2) = 13/n and so on for all sides. If the dice were fair, a distribution we denote with Q, we would expect every side to have equal probability. In other words assuming q sides, Q(1) = Q(2) = ... = 1/q. I will continue to write it as a generic distribution Q though, because this test would work regardless of what the distribution is considered fair. And as I will discuss at the end, the case of Q being uniform is extremely boring. \n\nSo, first we ask what is the probability that a given **x** occurred given the dice are fair? Writing out the probability of a sequence as the product of the probabilities of the observed sides, and then grouping the sides together,  we end up with\n\nPr( **x** | fair dice ) = 2^-n(D(P**x**||Q)+H(P**x**))\n\nwhere D(P**x** || Q ) is the relative entropy function defined by\n\nsum_a  P**x**(a) log_2 P**x**(a) / Q(a)\n\nand H is entropy \n\n-sum_a P**x**(a) \\log_2 P**x**(a).\n\nNow lets consider our test, we want to maximize the number of **x** such that k(**x**) = 1 (maximizing the number of observations we label unfair) while still maintaining that Pr( k(**x**) = 1 | fair dice)  < *v*. Because\n\nPr( k(**x**) = 1 | fair dice) = sum_{**x**} Pr( **x** | fair dice) k(**x**) = sum_{**x**}  k(**x**) 2^-n(D(P**x**||Q)+H(P**x**)).\n\nWe therefore, somewhat obviously, want k(**x**) = 1 for the smallest values of 2^-n(D(P**x**||Q)+H(P**x**)) (recall this is the probability of **x** given the sequence, so in essence, I am saying the best test chooses the most likely values of **x** as fair, and the least likely as unfair). So we have an optimal test based entirely on the empirical distribution of **x**. Because the number of different P**x** is restricted by the fact we have n-rolls, and this number grows polynomially with n, these optimal tests can be exactly determined up to a n of around say 500. For n past 500 approximations are generally sufficient. \n\nSo why is Q being uniform extremely boring? Well if Q is uniform then \n\nD(P**x**||Q)+H(P**x**) = sum_a  P**x**(a) log_2 q = log_2 q.\n\nEvery sequence you observe is equally likely, therefore the probability of error of the test is determined only by the number of values labelled as fair. But this also makes sense, if you are to label 1/3 of all outcomes as being unfair, then your observation will be in that set 1/3 of the time. This also means that our test can be independent of our observation, which means that our test is equivalent to randomly guessing. **In other words, any test to determine if a dice is fair is going to be equivalent to a test which is independent of observation.** One caveat though, if we were to define an alternative distribution for unfair dice, we could determine which of the two was more likely. \n\n\n\n##Optimal tests when the dice are not uniform\n\nSo as discussed, this problem is basically FUBAR when the dice are uniform. So what about when Q is not uniform? Recall\n\nPr( k(**x**) = 1 | fair dice)  = sum_{**x**}  k(**x**) 2^-n(D(P**x**||Q)+H(P**x**)).\n\nBy grouping the **x** in the summation according to their distributions P**x**, we can re-write this as\n\nPr( k(**x**) = 1 | fair dice)  = sum_{P**x**}  R(P**x**) |T(P**x**)| 2^-n(D(P**x**||Q)+H(P**x**))\n\nwhere T(P**x**) is the set of **x** for a given P**x**, |T(P**x**)| is the number of those **x**, and the R(P**x**) is the ratio of how many values of **x** in T(P**x**) have k(**x**) = 1. Writing u(P**x**) =   1/n log | T(P**x**) |- H(P**x**), it is possible to show that  u(P**x**) ->  0 as n grows to infinity. Thus we can rewrite our probability of error as\n\nsum_{P**x**}  R(P**x**)  2^-n(D(P**x**||Q) - u(P**x**)) .\n\nOnce again labelling the most likely values as fair, and the least likely as unfair is equivalent to setting all k(**x**) = 1 (unfair) such that \n\nD(P**x** || Q) > t + u(P**x**)\n\nwe can upper bound the probability of error of our test as  O(n) 2^-nt . Thus the probability it is not in that set dies off exponentially. Returning to the definition of relative entropy \n\nsum_a  P**x**(a) log_2 P**x**(a) / Q(a)\n\nwe can see that if P**x**(a) = Q(a) then D(P**x**||Q) = 0. In fact, that is the only time which it is 0. Thus depending on how discriminating you allow the distribution to be, you can expect the number of dice rolls to be in fact very very reasonable.\n\nedit - Complete re-write for clarity. Added more.

Thus what you choose to call \"stationary\" and what you choose to call \"moving fast\" is entirely arbitrary and has no \"legitimacy\" as far as the universe and the laws of physics are concerned.  However, special relativity dictates that things in motion relative to one another, if they separate in space, stop, turn around, and then meet back up, will find that they agree on where they are in spatial coordinates but they won't agree in the temporal coordinate (I.e. how much time has past since they were together).

In solids, you can treat these questions through the study of [electronic band structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_band_structure), which relies heavily on [Bloch's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_wave) and also on the [Fermi-Dirac statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_statistics).

This will give you the most detailed description of how photons and electrons interact. I would argue, however, that QED is often a bit of an overkill for condensed matter or atomic physics problems (not always, but often). Therefore you will find many \"effective models\", which can significantly simplify things.\n\nAmong these effective models, you have for example the [Hubbard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model), which includes interactions between electrons, without explicitly including the fact that these interactions are mediated via the electromagnetic field. You have a whole zoo of similar models, so I will not go into all of them. The main point is that they usually focus on the behaviour of the electrons and do not explicitly consider couplings to the electromagnetic field. There are, however, models which study  the response of the material to the electromagnetic field.

These can be found, for example, in quantum optics. In these models, you typically make serious simplifications on the level of the \"matter\" and focus on the electromagnetic field. Typically, the interaction between light and matter generates some type on nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic field, so I would argue that the vast majority of models in [nonlinear optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics) are models where you had some type of interaction with matter, which you coarse-grain out. Note, however, that these effective descriptions do not even require quantum mechanics to make sense. You can usually do nonlinear optics using Maxwell's equations. If you want to see effective models of the quantum side of the electromagnetic field in action, you have to turn to [quantum optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optics), where you usually include matter (like a \"two-level atom\") in a more explicit way, see for example the [Jaynes-Cummings model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaynes%E2%80%93Cummings_model).\n\nWith this little excursion into the realm of optics, you may notice that there was not a lot of \"electricity\".

You don't hear too much about that poor hockey stick anymore, mainly because it did not describe the condition of the earth's climate at all.\nAnd then, just when it seemed it could get no worse for climate modelers, revised temperature numbers showing no temperature increase in 10 years....Ooops. Well that's just because dummies like me don't understand the physics involved. When the climate modelers said \"global warming\" they really meant \"Climate Change\". \n And it's because I don't have a PH.D. that I don't get it, Right?\nWhen witnessing the hysteria of climate modelers when a scientist questions any aspect of their process or their claims, it doesn't strike one as the response of a scientist. I guess that's why when one compares the actual temperatures to the predicted temperatures there is such a disparity. These are small examples of what has been the history of \"The Global Warming/Climate Change Movement.\" There's not much here that one can accept, unless of course you commit the error of \"appeal to authority.\"", "id": "d3w32wh"}, {"comment": "> when a scientist questions any aspect of their process or their claims, it doesn't strike one as the response of a scientist. \n\nThat's odd...I would've thought the unscientific thing here would be to criticize the research when you don't actually understand basic climate concepts, and just take your talking points from right-wing think tanks that have a vested interest in opposing any carbon legislation.", "id": "d3w5yz6"}, {"comment": "Furthermore, to question ones results, methodology, or interpretation is an inherent and fundamental part of the scientific process.

I missed the part where an Olympic item is guaranteed in each box. This post still explains the general method to solve the problem though.\n\n---\nEach box is independent of any other box, hence the looting of each box is a Bernouilli trial with probability *p*. A box is a \"success\" if it contains the specific item you want. Let's say that the chance the box contains the item you want is *p*. The *geometric distribution* tells you the distribution of the number of trials needed to get one success. In particular, the probability that the *k*th trial is the first success is\n\n> P*_k_* = (1-p)^(k-1)p\n\nThe probability that you need *at most* *N* trials to get the first success is the sum of these probabilities from k = 1 to k = N, or\n\n> P = P*_1_*+P*_2_*+...+P*_N_* = 1-(1-p)^(N)\n\nYour question is how many trials you need to have a 50% chance of success. To keep it general, replace 50% with some desired success chance *s*. Then you want to solve the following equation for *N*:\n\n> 1-(1-p)^(N) = s\n\nThe solution is\n\n> N = log(1-s)/log(1-p)\n\nIn your specific example, we have s = 0.5. What is the chance a box has the item you want? Well, let *t* be the chance a specific *item* is the item you want. For the box to have the item you want, at least one of the items must be the one you want.

I missed the part where an Olympic item is guaranteed in each box. This post still explains the general method to solve the problem though.\n\n---\nEach box is independent of any other box, hence the looting of each box is a Bernouilli trial with probability *p*. A box is a \"success\" if it contains the specific item you want. Let's say that the chance the box contains the item you want is *p*. The *geometric distribution* tells you the distribution of the number of trials needed to get one success. In particular, the probability that the *k*th trial is the first success is\n\n> P*_k_* = (1-p)^(k-1)p\n\nThe probability that you need *at most* *N* trials to get the first success is the sum of these probabilities from k = 1 to k = N, or\n\n> P = P*_1_*+P*_2_*+...+P*_N_* = 1-(1-p)^(N)\n\nYour question is how many trials you need to have a 50% chance of success. To keep it general, replace 50% with some desired success chance *s*. Then you want to solve the following equation for *N*:\n\n> 1-(1-p)^(N) = s\n\nThe solution is\n\n> N = log(1-s)/log(1-p)\n\nIn your specific example, we have s = 0.5. What is the chance a box has the item you want? Well, let *t* be the chance a specific *item* is the item you want. For the box to have the item you want, at least one of the items must be the one you want. The chance of that is\n\n> p = 1-(1-t)^(4)\n\nSubstituting into our equation for *N*, we have\n\n> N = (1/4)\\*log(1-s)/log(1-t)\n\n(In other words, you can just calculate the number of *items* you need and divide by 4.)

Thank you, Midtek, I really appreciated the detailed reply. ", "id": "d61j9u1"}, {"comment": "This is a beautiful answer, and relevant to my interests, but it doesn't seem to factor in the fact that the loot box is guaranteed to contain an Olympic item -- but not necessarily an epic or legendary one.", "id": "d61nq7p"}, {"comment": "Oh, I suppose I missed that part. I guess then I'm not sure how the loot system works. If an Olympic item is guaranteed, then is that item just a random 1 of the 12 available? If so, then *p* = 1/12 and you can eliminate the factor of (1/4) from the formula for *N*. This will only be lower bound for *N* since it doesn't account for the possibility of other 3 items being Olympic items.\n\nTo account for that, the value of *t* has to be changed. If the first item is guaranteed Olympic, then say it has a 1/12 chance to be the one you want. The other three items can be anything. Let *q* = chance of getting the item you want on a non-guaranteed-Olympic item (which is 0.00055 for epic item). So then *t* = 1-(11/12)\\*(1-q)^(3). From there, substitute into the formula for *N* to get\n\n> *N* = log(1-s)/[ log(11/12) + 3 log(1-q) ]\n\nWith the given values, you need [7.8 boxes](http://tinyurl.com/zsj96t6) to have a 50% of getting the item you want. As for the expected number of boxes, it's still just 1/(chance of getting item in a box), which is just [*n* = 1/*t* = 11.78 boxes](http://tinyurl.com/z8y3z4v). Notice that this is only very slightly less than 12, which is what the expected number of boxes would be if the other 3 items could not be Olympic. Even though those items *can* be Olympic, the chance is so small that it hardly affects the problem at all.\n\nSo assuming that the guaranteed Olympic item is randomly selected form the 12 available, then it's an average of 12 boxes to get a specific item. Not very interesting. =(", "id": "d61rmil"}, {"comment": "> If an Olympic item is guaranteed, then is that item just a random 1 of the 12 available? \n\nThere are a lot more than 12 available; in addition to the 12 mentioned in the OP, there are a ton of common ones, for a total of [\"over 100\"](http://www.shacknews.com/article/96118/here-are-all-of-overwatchs-rio-olympics-2016-skins).

[I asked this in another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4vufva/how_many_loot_boxes_must_i_open_to_get_a_50/) and would like to get some clarification on the [card collector problem](http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/REU/2003/CouponCollectorReport.pdf) (CCP) if you have time.\n\nFirst let me clarify the problem. All the values in the OP are correct: 1 loot crate = 4 draws, with one draw guaranteed to be from the pool of 120 event items. I agree that this guaranteed draw is a Bernoulli trial, however the other three draws follow the geometric distribution of CCP because the 120 event items are a subset of a much larger set of roughly 1,200 non-event items with a probability distribution as stated in the OP (i.e. common, rare, epic, and legendary).\n\nUnfortunately there are a few complications that I haven't been able to work out or find the answer to:\n\n1. Since each crate has one guaranteed draw of an event item, would you simply add the probability of the Bernoulli trial to the probability of the geometric distribution of the CCP formula \u2014 or is a synthesis of the two probability distributions needed?\n\n1. The 120 event items are a subset of a much larger pool of roughly 1,200 items. How does this affect the geometric distribution of the CCP formulation?", "id": "d634pwd"}, {"comment": "Both questions are answered either in my top-level response or the followup. The final formula is\n\n> N = log(1-s)/[ log(1-p) + 3 log(1-q) ]\n\nwhere\n\n> N = number of boxes needed to achieve desired chance of success\n\n> s = desired chance of success (50% for OP)\n\n> p = chance that guaranteed Olympic item is the one you want (if it's random then p = 1/120, if it's based on item class, then it's a bit different)\n\n> q = chance that a non-guaranteed Olympic item is the one you want (this was 0.00055 for epic items)\n\nThe expected number of boxes for one success is\n\n> n = 1/[ 1 - (1-p)(1-q)^(3) ]\n\nIf you are asking specifically about the number of boxes you need to collect *all* Olympic items, then it's a variant on the CCP which is difficult enough that I would probably just refer you to any number of papers on the problem. The classic CCP is concerned with collecting *N* coupons, each of which has an equal chance of appearing in a given draw. The Overwatch variant is concerned with collecting some subset of *M* coupons from *N* total coupons, and the coupons actually have different chances of appearing in a given draw. I know this variant has been solved, but the formula is a bit complicated. The paper you linked considers several variants of the problem, but the coupons always have equal chance of being drawn.\n\nIf you want to solve the problem yourself, I would just forget about the 3 items that are not guaranteed to be Olympic. The pool for those cards is 10 times larger, and so they should not affect the final answer too much and including those draws just complicates the problem way too much. So it's much easier to consider each box as a single draw of a guaranteed Olympic item. Now if the items all had equal chance of discovery, the expected number of boxes would be *n* = 120 H*_120_*, which is [about 644](http://tinyurl.com/jqqsf9o). But items in different classes (uncommon, common, etc.) do not have equal chance of discovery. So you should search for a variant of the CCP with unequal chance of discovery.\n\n[Here is a StackExchange post](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/600012/coupon-collectors-problem-with-unequal-probabilities) that briefly discusses that variant. The solution isn't terribly difficult, but the formula is very long and unwieldy for even just a few total coupons. [This StackExchange post](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/25568/expected-number-of-rolling-a-pair-of-dice-to-generate-all-possible-sums) also discusses the problem and gives the final answer as an integral. So if you have a computer algebra system on your computer (e.g., Mathematica), the integral formula should be much easier to use. What's nice about the integral formula is that you only really need the chance of getting an item in a given class and how many items are in each class.\n\nFor instance, suppose that the item is first rolled for its item class and then rolled for the specific item. So the chance of getting a specific epic Olympic item is p*_e_* = (7.2%)\\*(1/6) and the chance of getting a specific legendary Olympic item is p*_l_* = (2.5%)\\*(1/6). I don't know what the common (p*_c_*) and rare (p*_r_*) are since I don't know how many Olympic items are in each class. If you could tell me that, then I could evaluate the integral and give you the answer.", "id": "d63ofvl"}, {"comment": "Wait, do we know how the software developers coded it?

This allows people to consider time running forward or backwards and other fun stuff.  A big problem with black holes is that they appear to destroy information.  If nothing can come out of a black hole you can't, even given all information about it currently, figure out what went in.  We're not talking in a practical sense here but a fundamental sense.  For example, given all the information about every particle and location in a star, it's not feasible to be able to figure out what everything looked like an instant before, but it is theoretically possible.\n\nNow to get around the loss of information in black holes, Hawking Radiation was proposed.  Essentially black holes are actually slowly evaporating by emitting energy.  If this energy were perfectly analyzed it would yield all the information that was temporarily stored in the black hole.  This is ongoing work, there are some ideas being thrown about about the information actually being encoded as holograms on the surface of black holes, but you get the idea.\n\nNote that up to this point there has been zero consideration of any alternate universes of any sort.  You go in and get crunched with your final moments being told via radiation at a later date or get plastered in one less dimension on the side, or something like that, but that's it.  A few people though once did a thought experiment about what a black hole would look like going backwards in time.  This, if going forward in our time, is called a white hole.  It would have an event horizon that not even light could enter but everything would be able to escape from.  They've never been detected, and violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, but it works mathematically using Einstein's equations of spacetime.\n\nWhite holes gave scientists another cool idea.  What would a white hole look like going backwards in time?  You'd think we'd be back to a regular black hole, but this time - since the black hole wasn't caused by gravitational collapse and sucking stuff into it - we have a new type called an eternal black hole.  Eternal black holes haven't consumed any information so they don't need to be spitting it back out.\n\nAnd finally we get to \"alternate universes\".  If you draw an eternal black hole a very specific (mathematically valid) way with time as one axis (up being forward in time in the diagram linked below) and space as another, you end up with 6 regions.  Within the white hole event horizon, within the black hole event horizon, at the singularity at the beginning of time, at the singularity at the end of time, and two separate regions of space.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/b8QrRJU.png\n\nTheoretically you could draw a line such that if you fell into this eternal blackhole, you might be able to see light from the other region of normal space (though not get into that region as you are still headed unerringly towards the singularity and by definition there is no way into the white hole's event horizon space).  This is what people are talking about when they say black holes can lead to other universes.\n\nNow to summarize...eternal black holes have no known mechanism for being created; white holes have never been observed, violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics as entropy decreases, have no known mechanism for being created; drawing the eternal black hole in that way is just a mathematical trick to say a path between the two spaces is possible but it might not be possible for other reasons and would certainly be unstable; and those two regions of normal spacetime are by no means \"alternate universes\" any more than saying the inside surface of a sphere is an alternate universe to the outside surface of a sphere.  Asking what happens to the mathematical trickery peephole wormhole spaces when these non-existent theoretical solutions to Einstein's equations collide just doesn't make much sense.  \n\nThe main answer is that black holes don't lead to other universes but are just pinched off parts of our own.", "id": "d046agm"}, {"comment": "The simplest answer to this is that, although these are solutions to general relativity, these black holes are static (or stationary) and we have little reason (a priori) to think they have anything to do with reality.\n\nIt turns out that they are still quite useful solutions to look at because the exteriors black holes which form from collapse very quickly settle down to the \"idealised\" black holes. The interiors however aren't very similar and there is no \"room\" for another universe.\n\nTo explain what I mean by having no \"room\" I think it is best to look at the two diagrams on the left [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram#/media/File:PENROSE2.PNG).

But when I measure this same light, I will not see it moving at 0.01c, I'll see it moving at c as well. Everyone, moving at any speed relative to each other will all agree that the speed of light is c, even if they don't agree on how fast everyone is moving.\n\nSounds like you need a primer on Special Relativity, which is good because it's how the universe works, it's totally unintuitive compared to everything we experience and it's fun.

Technically the plane flies straight ahead, which means it would be flying away from the surface and out into space.

", "id": "d0ir6if"}, {"comment": "This answer is correct. Light rays reflected from a point on an object diverge. The refractive ocular components of people with myopia or hyperopia don\u2019t converge the light rays properly, so they're unable to focus the light rays properly on the retina. When you view an object in the mirror, it isn\u2019t actually located at the position of the mirror, the light rays diverged some amount before hitting the mirror, and the refractive components of your eye aren\u2019t able to converge them properly without the aid of your glasses.\n\nLong answer:\nLight rays reflected from a point on an object will tend to diverge. The refractive components of your eye (cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous humor) are required to converge the rays back into a point on your retina. People who have myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) have a mismatch between the refractive power of the optical components of their eye and the depth of their eyeball.\n\nPeople who have nearsightedness (myopia) have eye depths that are too long relative to the strength of their refractive components. The refractive components are refracting TOO much for the depth of their eye, so the position in space where the light rays converge to a point (are focused) lies in front of the retina, whereafter they cross and diverge. So when the light (that originated in a particular point in space) falls on the retina, it isn\u2019t perfectly focused; it\u2019s spread about. For people with hyperopia, the strength of their refractive components is too weak, such that the image ends up focused behind the retina (light rays have not yet converged at location of retina). Your glasses result in either an increase (hyperopia -biconvex lens) or decrease (myopia -biconcave lens) in refractive power.\n\nFor a far away star that emits photons in random directions, only those photons that happen to be traveling toward the earth actually get here, so the light rays reaching our eyes from further away objects, like the sun, are more parallel. Thus, we need less refractive power to perceive those objects clearly (we adjust the refractive power of our eyes by adjusting the thickness of our lens). When we\u2019re focusing on far away objects, our lens is thin, resulting in less refraction.\n\nFor nearer objects, which reflect more diverging rays to our eyes, our lens thickens to increase the refractive power of our eyes. \n\nThe object you see in the mirror isn\u2019t actually located at the location of the mirror. It\u2019s located somewhere further away. Because the object you're viewing is actually further away, it reflected more parallel rays to the mirror, which reflected more parallel rays to you. When you view the object in the mirror, your lens adjusts its thickness just as it would if the same object were located an equal distance away from the mirror but behind it. If your myopic, the object is more difficult to see in this case because your refractive power is too great, and parallel lines don't require much refraction. If you're hyperopic, your refractive power is weaker, and the object is actually easier to see in the mirror than it would be if it were located at the position of the mirror.\n\nIt would be different if the object were actually physically located at the location of the mirror, because then the light rays reaching your eyes from that object would have a different degree of divergence (more divergence, because the object is closer). So, for someone with myopia, whose refractive power is too great relative to the length of their eyeball, closer objects (which require more refraction to be seen clearly) are easier to see. Thus, if the object were actually located at the physical position of the mirror, you would be able to see it clearly. For someone with hyperopia, the object would now be more difficult to see, because they have too little refractive power relative to the depth of their eyeball, so nearer objects (which require more refraction), are more difficult to see. \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d0iwec2"}, {"comment": "Thank you.

Does it need to communicate with anything? Observe anything? Does it need to orient itself?

These things can, over time, cause a spacecraft to become oriented in a way that you don't want, or even cause rotation. A lot of the time you'll want to have your spacecraft's solar panels pointed at the sun, it's observational equipment pointed at whatever it needs to be looking at, and it's communications equipment pointed wherever it needs to be (such as towards Earth). None of that requires fuel necessarily but it does require stability, and maintaining stability requires propulsion.\n\nAdditionally, the forces I described as well as others can slowly change orbits over time, so for a satellite that needs to be in a very precise orbit (such as a communications satellite) it's necessary to constantly adjust to counteract those things. This is one of the major limitations on the useful lifetime of communications satellites. For low orbit spacecraft there is just enough drag from the tenuous outer fringes of the atmosphere to cause the orbit to slowly degrade over time, and if that's not counteracted the spacecraft will eventually re-enter.\n\nSome spacecraft don't have fuel at all though, such as the Hubble space telescope. Instead they use other techniques to maintain long term attitude stability, such as a combination of reaction wheels and \"magneto torquers\" which work against the Earth's magnetic field."], [4, "In its simplest form: we need to carry fuel because corrections will have to be made along the way (depending on where the destination is). A ship traveling through space will encounter the gravitational pull of any object it passes by, even on the smallest scale.

If you bump into enough things, you will change direction and/or speed. If you fall into some other bodies gravitational field, it alters your trajectory as much as you alter it's -but if its bigger than you, then you alter it by tiny amounts compared to its trajectory while it alters yours by relatively larger amounts because the masses don't equate: big things move smaller and small things move bigger in these encounters."], [1, "Yes, the object will keep moving along a fixed path forever (though gravity means that path won't be a straight line).  You need to carry fuel if you want to deviate from that path.\n\nExample: for the moon landings, the Apollo spacecraft launched on a long oval trajectory that looped around the Earth and Moon.  They didn't need to burn fuel to continue along that trajectory, but they did need to burn fuel at the end of the trip to switch into an orbit around the moon rather than flying right past it."], [1, "> Edit: When I meant fuel, I was talking about propulsion fuel. I'm aware that the rocket/spacecraft still needs fuel to maneuver about in space.\n\nYou're right, after the major manoeuvres have been performed the spacecraft only has the small amount of fuel it'll need for minor corrections. They don't carry any extra fuel.\n\n> From what I understand, objects in space move in a straight line with the velocity it was given until it was interrupted by another force (Newton's first law).\n\nIt's a bit more complicated. There's the Sun's gravity so the trajectory will never be a true straight line. Orbital dynamics are carefully calculated. After reaching escape velocity it will leave Earth's gravitational well in a hyperbola, but that will become an ellipse when it gets in the Sun's gravitational domain.\n\n> Does the gravity of all the planets and bodies in solar system interfere with this somehow?\n\nCertainly. The Sun's gravity is the major determinant for interplanetary trajectories. But once it gets close to the target planet, the spacecraft will be accelerated by its gravity in a hyperbola again, so it will have to perform a major rocket burn to turn this into a closed orbit around the planet. This can be even more than what it needed to escape Earth.\n\nThe trajectory is planned early in the design of a spacecraft. Combine this with the analysis of the different environments that the spacecraft will have to operate in, and the possible way of satisfying all functional requirements (science observations, etc) and you essentially get what we call mission analysis. The delta-v budget is one of the major outputs of this phase.\n\nAfter that the spacecraft is designed specifically for that mission.

None of that requires fuel necessarily but it does require stability, and maintaining stability requires propulsion.\n\nAdditionally, the forces I described as well as others can slowly change orbits over time, so for a satellite that needs to be in a very precise orbit (such as a communications satellite) it's necessary to constantly adjust to counteract those things. This is one of the major limitations on the useful lifetime of communications satellites. For low orbit spacecraft there is just enough drag from the tenuous outer fringes of the atmosphere to cause the orbit to slowly degrade over time, and if that's not counteracted the spacecraft will eventually re-enter.\n\nSome spacecraft don't have fuel at all though, such as the Hubble space telescope.

The Sun's gravity is the major determinant for interplanetary trajectories.

Spinning helps stabilize the ball, and prevents small turbulent effects from affecting its flightpath. A non-spinning ball isn't perfectly spherical, so as the air comes off the face of the ball, it creates turbulence in the air, and causes the ball to move erratically. You can see an example of vortex shedding here:\nhttps://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/mix.gif\n\nFor something like a curve ball, the spin of the ball is what causes it to move in a certain direction. As the ball spins, one side goes in the same direction as the air passing the ball, and the other side goes in the opposite direction of the air passing the ball. The side that moves in the same direction accelerates the air slightly (imagine the surface being rough, and acting to push the air as it goes by). The side going in the opposite direction slows the air slightly. As air accelerates, the pressure drops, and as it slows, the pressure rises (this is how planes fly). The net result is that the ball gets pushed by this pressure difference. With a top spin, you'll see the ball dropping, and with a backspin, you'll see the ball rising (or at least not dropping as quickly). If you apply this to a side spin, it'll cause the ball to curve from left-to-right or right-to-left.\n\nIt's worth noting that fluid dynamics is super complicated, but that's a pretty simplified explanation.\n\nEDIT: THANKS FOR THE GOLD!"], [119, "The knuckle ball you see in the gif has almost no spin, which makes it susceptible to slight turbulences and variations in the air, which can push it one way or another (or more than one way) as it approaches the plate. The pitcher has no idea which way it will curve and, as you can see, neither do the batter or catcher.\n\nThe knuckle ball is unique as the only pitch that doesn\u2019t have deliberate spin. Fastballs, curves, sliders, etc all are given spin as the ball is released from the pitcher\u2019s fingertips. Any ball moving rapidly through the air creates a wake of turbulence behind it. It also carries a thin layer of air along with it. \n\nWhen a spinning ball is moving through the air the spin influences the wake of turbulence behind it, pushing it in the direction that the back of the ball, the part facing the pitcher. Some of the thin layer of air traveling with the ball is also stripped off and thrown in that same direction. Because of conservation of momentum and Newton\u2019s third law, if a mass of air is pushed one way, the ball will be pushed the other way. For instance, a fastball, because of how it leaves the pitcher\u2019s hand, has backspin. The top of the ball is spinning in the opposite direction of travel and the side facing the pitcher is spinning down. That makes the turbulent wake move down and thus causes the fast ball to rise. (It doesn\u2019t actually rise, but it doesn\u2019t drop as much as it seems it should.)\n\nA curve ball is thrown with a top spin, pushing the wake upward, making the ball curve down. The pitcher might throw the curve with the top spin at a slight angle, making it curve down and away.\n\nThey say the ball breaks, meaning it seems to curve just before it reaches the plate. In fact it is curving all the way there, but when it is near the plate is has slowed down enough that the curve is more pronounced.\n\nThe effect caused by the spin pushing the air in one direction and the ball in the other is called the [Magnus Effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect)"], [52, "Oh, that's a tricky one. I'm not good at explaining it myself, [but there exists a nice infographic](http://imgur.com/a/nWkha) that does it quite weill I think.

There's a really cool phenomenon that happens when the baseball has no spin, and it's called vortex shedding. [Here's a pretty cool video demonstrating that with water.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hbbkd2d3H8) When the turbulence gets built up too much on one side, the vortex is shed, and the ball moves the other way. \n\nFor regular curveballs, the pitcher puts spin on the ball, which overrides this effect. Vortex shedding only happens when there is no to little spin on the ball. \n\nIf you watched the video, you might have seen the part where the man talks about how at the high flow rate, there isn't much going on with vortex shedding. That's because it only happens at slower speeds. That's why when a pitcher throws a knuckleball, it has to be slow. The pitcher in the gif you showed us threw it at only 75 mph, which as you probably know is very slow for a major league pitch. \n\nIf you want to know about curveballs, there's a different principle at work here, and it's called the Magnus Effect. Imagine that you have a ball spinning through the air, with a downward spin. As the ball cuts through the air particles, the bottom of the ball will actually be moving with the air, and the top part will be moving against the flow of the air. This builds up air up and behind the ball, which forces the ball downward.

Spinning helps stabilize the ball, and prevents small turbulent effects from affecting its flightpath. A non-spinning ball isn't perfectly spherical, so as the air comes off the face of the ball, it creates turbulence in the air, and causes the ball to move erratically. You can see an example of vortex shedding here:\nhttps://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/mix.gif\n\nFor something like a curve ball, the spin of the ball is what causes it to move in a certain direction. As the ball spins, one side goes in the same direction as the air passing the ball, and the other side goes in the opposite direction of the air passing the ball. The side that moves in the same direction accelerates the air slightly (imagine the surface being rough, and acting to push the air as it goes by). The side going in the opposite direction slows the air slightly. As air accelerates, the pressure drops, and as it slows, the pressure rises (this is how planes fly). The net result is that the ball gets pushed by this pressure difference. With a top spin, you'll see the ball dropping, and with a backspin, you'll see the ball rising (or at least not dropping as quickly). If you apply this to a side spin, it'll cause the ball to curve from left-to-right or right-to-left.\n\nIt's worth noting that fluid dynamics is super complicated, but that's a pretty simplified explanation.\n\nEDIT: THANKS FOR THE GOLD!", "id": "d72zdj3"}, {"comment": "Just a tiny typo correction (I think) to avoid confusion for me and Jack.\n\n\"For a knuckleball, the ball moves around as it approaches the pitcher because it isn't spinning.\"  \n\nShould be...\n\n\"For a knuckleball, the ball moves around as it approaches the **catcher** because it isn't spinning.\" Yea?

Fastballs, curves, sliders, etc all are given spin as the ball is released from the pitcher\u2019s fingertips. Any ball moving rapidly through the air creates a wake of turbulence behind it.

Some of the thin layer of air traveling with the ball is also stripped off and thrown in that same direction. Because of conservation of momentum and Newton\u2019s third law, if a mass of air is pushed one way, the ball will be pushed the other way. For instance, a fastball, because of how it leaves the pitcher\u2019s hand, has backspin. The top of the ball is spinning in the opposite direction of travel and the side facing the pitcher is spinning down. That makes the turbulent wake move down and thus causes the fast ball to rise.

There's a really cool phenomenon that happens when the baseball has no spin, and it's called vortex shedding. [Here's a pretty cool video demonstrating that with water.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hbbkd2d3H8) When the turbulence gets built up too much on one side, the vortex is shed, and the ball moves the other way. \n\nFor regular curveballs, the pitcher puts spin on the ball, which overrides this effect. Vortex shedding only happens when there is no to little spin on the ball. \n\nIf you watched the video, you might have seen the part where the man talks about how at the high flow rate, there isn't much going on with vortex shedding. That's because it only happens at slower speeds. That's why when a pitcher throws a knuckleball, it has to be slow. The pitcher in the gif you showed us threw it at only 75 mph, which as you probably know is very slow for a major league pitch. \n\nIf you want to know about curveballs, there's a different principle at work here, and it's called the Magnus Effect. Imagine that you have a ball spinning through the air, with a downward spin. As the ball cuts through the air particles, the bottom of the ball will actually be moving with the air, and the top part will be moving against the flow of the air. This builds up air up and behind the ball, which forces the ball downward.

These are my views and subsequent arguments.\n\nWho says that numbers have to \"exist\"? Numbers were originally just properties used to describe collections of objects. Properties need not exist. \"Yellow\" for instance, does not exist, it is just a human-made construction that we impose onto objects that perceive to look like other things that are \"yellow\". This need not be physical \"yellowness\" either, as our mind can play tricks, our eyes can be wired weirdly to make us see yellow where others wouldn't or vice versa. (See \"The Dress\"). In a same way, people can assign different numbers to the same thing. Say I put one thing, A, on a table and then put another thing, B, on the same table, how many things are on the table? Some might assign the property \"2\" to the things on the table, but another might assign the property \"4\" to the table. The four things on the table are the set of nothing, the set of {A}, the set of {B} and the set of {A,B}. Who is correct? Is there a counter somewhere in \"existence\" that counts the things on the table? That seems oddly unnecessary, no one is correct because there is no right or wrong way to perceive things and assign properties to them.\n\nHumans are expert pattern-finders. Or, I should say, pattern creators because patterns are properties that we assign to things and events and are, therefore, man-made. Generally, people will see the same kind of patterns in the same things (due to evolutionary biases to specific patterns), just as most people will agree on what things are yellow, and so we need a way to communicate these patterns to others. If person A tells person B to look for the \"yellow fruit\" to make a tangy, refreshing beverage, then, then person B knows that yellow means \"The color property that the sun has\". There is a common language to communicate color. In a same way, we invented a common language to communicate patterns and that language is Math. If we tell person B he needs four of those yellow fruits to make the beverage, then person B knows they need as many fruits as there are lines here ||||.\n\nLike all languages, there is a correct grammar with which to effectively communicate. \"5+6=2\" is bad grammer and doesn't effectively communicate the pattern of addition that we invented.

It is an artifact of our desire to find patterns in the world."]], [[{"comment": "Disclaimer: The existence of numbers and math is a philosophical question with no real answer. These are my views and subsequent arguments.\n\nWho says that numbers have to \"exist\"? Numbers were originally just properties used to describe collections of objects. Properties need not exist. \"Yellow\" for instance, does not exist, it is just a human-made construction that we impose onto objects that perceive to look like other things that are \"yellow\". This need not be physical \"yellowness\" either, as our mind can play tricks, our eyes can be wired weirdly to make us see yellow where others wouldn't or vice versa. (See \"The Dress\"). In a same way, people can assign different numbers to the same thing. Say I put one thing, A, on a table and then put another thing, B, on the same table, how many things are on the table? Some might assign the property \"2\" to the things on the table, but another might assign the property \"4\" to the table. The four things on the table are the set of nothing, the set of {A}, the set of {B} and the set of {A,B}. Who is correct? Is there a counter somewhere in \"existence\" that counts the things on the table? That seems oddly unnecessary, no one is correct because there is no right or wrong way to perceive things and assign properties to them.\n\nHumans are expert pattern-finders. Or, I should say, pattern creators because patterns are properties that we assign to things and events and are, therefore, man-made. Generally, people will see the same kind of patterns in the same things (due to evolutionary biases to specific patterns), just as most people will agree on what things are yellow, and so we need a way to communicate these patterns to others. If person A tells person B to look for the \"yellow fruit\" to make a tangy, refreshing beverage, then, then person B knows that yellow means \"The color property that the sun has\". There is a common language to communicate color. In a same way, we invented a common language to communicate patterns and that language is Math. If we tell person B he needs four of those yellow fruits to make the beverage, then person B knows they need as many fruits as there are lines here ||||.\n\nLike all languages, there is a correct grammar with which to effectively communicate. \"5+6=2\" is bad grammer and doesn't effectively communicate the pattern of addition that we invented. Each pattern has an implied rule, eg: The pattern of addition results in larger numbers. We invented the pattern of addition to describe the event of receiving more things, so increasing value is key. \"5+6=2\" breaks this.

You are right that in practice 40km or 400km makes little difference, but the extra hundreds of kilometers will give a MUCH higher peak velocity.\n\nhttp://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/atmosphere/q0090.shtml\n\nSo from jumping off the ISS (hell of a jump really, as you would have to jump backwards from the ISS at 7,66km/s to start falling straight down) you would acelerate at about 0,9G initially, increasing as you approach the atmosphere at 100km. Even after entering the atmosphere it will be a long fall with continued acceleration before the atmosphere is thick enough to start breaking your fall. You will generate a lot of heat as you hit the atmosphere though, as your speed will likely be too high for the air in front of you to move away, and the compression of air in front of you will heat it up.", "id": "d5ml3ip"}, {"comment": "The rover would have to do almost 2 km/s to put someone in orbit. That's pretty close to the speed of the fastest plane ever made, the X-15.\n\nThe silver lining is that because of the lack of atmosphere, it is possible to enter arbitrarily low elliptical orbits without air slowing you down, and that's the closest you can get to gliding on the moon. For example the Apollo lunar module used an elliptical \"descent orbit\" that was 15 km at periapsis and 111 km at apoapsis with a velocity of 1.7 km/s ([this](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/nasa58040.pdf) NASA paper gives respectively 50.000 feet for periapsis, 60 nautical miles for apoapsis and 5560 feet/s for orbital velocity).\n\nOn Earth you'd need 8 km/s to maintain such an orbit (about Mach 28, or 4 times the speed of the X-15); you can see how getting into an orbit is much easier on the Moon. Furthermore, once you \"cut off the cord\", on Earth air would slow you down a lot and ultimately you'd glide back to the surface. This wouldn't happen on the moon: without an engine to slow you down you'll keep orbiting forever.\n\nThis orbit is actually pretty circular. While periapsis/apoapsis are usually given relative to the surface, the radiuses of the ellipse actually have to take into account the radius of the moon (1726 km): periapsis is 1726+15=1741 km away from the center of the moon, while apoapsis is at 1726+111=1837 km. Because the foci are at the center of the moon along the major axis, they are 111 km from the center of the orbit (one moon radius from apoapsis), which is pretty close to the center; the eccentricity is focus\\_distance\\_from\\_center / semimajor\\_axis\\_length = 111/1837=0.06. This is comparable to Mars's orbit around the Sun.\n\nThe fact that the eccentricity is low means that the orbital velocity does not vary substantially throughout the orbit. The formula for orbital velocity is sqrt(G*Mmoon/(Rmoon + Rorbit)), where M means mass and R means Radius; G is Newton's universal gravitational constant. Because Rorbit is going to be small compared to Rmoon, the result will be close to the lunar module's 1.7 km/s for any reasonable orbit radius you'll have in your parasailing/gliding experiment.\n\nSo the answer to your question is: you can \"glide\" around the moon arbitrarily low, but you'll need a rover that can push you to 1.7 km/s before you \"cut the cord\". The mechanics of this are completely different from gliding on Earth, which is why I put quotes around it. Once you do that you'll just go around the moon forever, just make sure that you don't have any mountains on your path.

That is why we have leap years, not because of units. If you don't do this, the solstices and equinoxes start moving through the calendar, and we try to avoid that."], [80, "You are missing the fact that after one year your clock would be skewed by 6 hours, after two years you would have that midnight on you clock would really be noon outside.\n\nOnly after 4 years the time on the clock would be same as the time of the day."], [52, "The second actually *used* to be defined in terms of the earth's rotation and orbit, it was 1/60x60x24^th of a mean solar day. It was after it became apparent that this measure wasn't very good that we redefined the second in terms of the oscillations of the cesium atom.\n\nThis is generally how units work - they're defined in terms of something convenient until measurements need to be more precise than the current definition allows, at which point it is given a more precise redefinition. \n\nFor example, the earth's day and orbit may naively seem to be very fixed things, but at the precision needed for modern units, they fall short. The earth's orbit is constantly perturbed by the gravity of other planets. The length of the earth's day is slowed by the moon's gravity. Earthquakes moves mass in the crust, which changes the length of the day in the same way that a spinning ballerina pulling her arms in will spin faster. In fact, we have to add [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) to keep our clocks synced up with the earth! This isn't because our clocks are bad at keeping time, it's because the earth is!\n\n\nBy defining the second (and thus, all time) in terms of oscillations of the cesium atom we have picked a timekeeper that is absolute and independent of any artifact or happenstance of nature. We have picked a definition for time that can be reproduced anywhere without loss of generality. The consequence? We need leap years and leap seconds every so often.

The second is a man-made unit that comes from dividing the day (a natural phenomenon). \n\nChanging the duration of the second would change the length of a day (on the clock), which creates a new problem. The clock would drift away from the natural cycle of sunrise and sunset (the 'real' day) Eventually you'd have sunrise at midnight, etc.\n\nThe original problem is that the year does not divide into an even number of days. Uncorrected, this would allow our calendar to get out of sync with the seasons. OP's proposal would allow the clock day to get out of sync with the natural day. \n\nUnder the Leap Day system, we allow the fractional days to build up into a whole day, then correct the accumulated error all at once. This has the major benefit of keeping the clock in sync with the natural day, at all times. An extra day every fourth year* is considered less disruptive than letting clocks get out of sync with the sunrise and sunset.\n\n*Bonus info: Technically, Leap Years occur every fourth year, except on years divisible by 100, unless that year is also divisible by 400.

It is the progression of noon within the year. The year is the time it takes the earth to go around the sun.

The end of the year is successively 1/4 of a day longer as measured by the position of noon beyond the 364 days of a normal year. Seconds, minutes and hours aren't involved. It is only the relationship of days to the length of the year that matters. Those aren't things people made up. We can't modify them because that would be silly. Seasons follow the year. Days are how we determine when to sleep."], [3, "There's a lot of math in the sciences that would need changing.

A year is the earth orbiting once around the sun.\n\nIf you started your year at midnight, the year would end at a dawn, the next year at a noon, the following year at a dusk, and finally the fourth year would end on a midnight again. If you count the four years by how many times you see the sun, you get 1461 days... or 365 days a year with one year getting an extra day.\n\nDays and years are a bit like counting how many chips a trucker eats, and how many cows he passes, and expecting the numbers to be divisible. It is just pure luck that we are as uncomplicated as we are.\n\nRedefining a chip crumble to make 100 chips-worth of crumbles per cow doesn't actually make the number of chips the trucker eats go down.

If we change any of those, our clocks will fall out of sync. What op is suggesting is we change them to match the time it takes for the earth to rotate around the sun. Currently it takes 365.25 full spins of the earths axis for the earth to rotate around the sun. This is a number we can not change. Even if we changed seconds to match the earths rotation around the sun, it would still take 365.25 full day and night cycles but we would only account for 365 days on our calendars. 2 years from now we would be a half day behind as the earth would have spun 730.5 times we are just beginning day 730."], [2, "No, it doesn't work like that, the earth would still take 24 hours to spin, but still take 365.25 days to go around the sun.

In fact, each passing day tends to be just a little shorter than the day before, and the day before that, and so on. So, by re-defining the duration of a second, you do not just create a huge confusion between \"seconds in the every-day-life\" and the \"world of physics\", but you would also have to re-define the duration of a second every whatsoever years.\n\nAnd believe me: It is easier to teach computers how to add leap seconds than it is to always build new clocks for Galileo and GPS that are up to date with the current definition of an earth second."], [2, "There's no reason for the number of times the earth spins around in a circle on its axis to be perfectly divisible by how long it takes to go around the sun.  That's the basic issue.\n\nAt times in Earth's past, the Earth spun much faster, so there would have been more days than 365.25 in a year.\n\nMillions of years in the future, the earth will spin slower as the moon robs it of rotational energy due to tidal forces.  Then there will be fewer days in a year.  "], [2, "The fundamental problem comes from the fact we try to measure time by how many times an object spins a full 360 degrees (the Earth's rotation) compared to how many times it goes around another object (orbit around the sun). One has basically zero bearing on the other, so it's never going to be perfect. "], [2, "Because countless industries, services and technologies rely on the SI units as they are defined right now. Of course we could redefine all units so that all them are combined and derived in round numbers. A lightyear could be exactly 300,000 km/s and not just roughly 300,000 km/s. But converting literally our entire zivilisation to these units would be expensive and painful and cause countless problems. It's easier to have some arbitrary looking definitions and add a leap day every four years.\n\nAlso, our time units are derived from celestial dynamics that aren't directly linked with each other. A year is full orbit around the sun and a day is a full rotation of Earth. Two cycles that aren't linked in any way.

It's clear that we can't just add K days every N years, because sqrt(17) is irrational (just like most numbers, e.g. the exact duration of the Earth's orbit, in days). So instead, we do some convergent rounding.\n\nIt can be shown that sqrt(17) = 4 + 1 / (8 + 1 / (8 + 1 / (8 + ...) ) ). This is a continued fraction, and one of its nice properties is that it gives us a series of convergent fractions:\n\n* 4 = 4/1 = 4\n* 4 + 1/8 = 33/8 = 4.125\n* 4 + 1/(8 + 1/8) = 268/65 = 4.12307...\n* 4 + 1/(8 + 1/(8 + 1/8)) = 4.123106...\n* ...\n* sqrt(17) = 4.1231056...\n\nThat converge \"very quickly\" to the target number in the following sense: Each of the convergents is closer to the target number than any fractions with an equal or smaller denominator. In other words they're in some sense the \"simplest\" fractional approximations to the target number.\n\nIf we take successive differences between these convergents we'll have the expression of sqrt(17) as a series of unit fractions:\n\n    sqrt(17) = 4 + 1/8 - 1/520 + 1/34320 - 1/2264592 + - ...\n\nwhich has the nice property that it's a bunch of unit fractions whose denominators are all divisible by the first denominator.

You can extend the formalism to include the possibility that you lack complete knowledge of your system (see density matrices), but nothing can possibly do away with this fundamental \"layer\" of probabilities that is *built in* to the postulates of QM."], [20, "Here's something a lot of people have trouble with:\n\nAn electron doesn't \"behave like a particle and a wave.\" An electron behaves like an electron. Some of an electron's behaviors are comparable to the behavior of a wave, and some of an electron's behaviors are comparable to the behavior of a particle, but an electron is an electron, and it does electron things. \n\nTake for example an analytical technique called Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure or EXAFS. In this technique, you shine x-rays of a carefully chosen energy on your sample and record how much of the x-ray beam is absorbed. You then slightly adjust the energy of the x-rays and do it again. Let's say you're interested in iron. You pick an x-ray energy just below the energy at which iron shows a sudden sharp jump in the amount of x-rays it absorbs. You increase the energy, make your measurements and end up with a graph like [this.](https://www.bnl.gov/ps/x18b/images/iron.gif) The big jump at the left of the graph corresponds with the energy required to remove an electron from a iron atom's K-shell. Below that energy, you remove no K-shell electrons. Above it, you have a chance to do so.\n\n**Now here's the important part for your question:**\nAbove the big jump (also called above the absorption edge) there are a bunch of wiggles in the absorption spectrum. Turns out, what's happening there is this:\n\n1) X-ray encounters iron atom\n\n2) X-ray excites (is absorbed by and therefore gives its energy to) a K-shell electron in the iron atom\n\n3) The atom emits a photoelectron (fancy name for an electron emitted because it was excited by a photon)\n\n4) The photoelectron is emitted as a **spherical wave** that travels away from the atom in every direction.\n\nNow, a number of very complicated things can happen, but lets look at two cases:\n\n5) The photoelectron encounters a neighboring atom and is \"reflected\" (really: elastically scattered) back to the original atom. \n\n6a) The neighboring atom is at the right distance such that the photoelectron has traveled n/2 wavelengths, where n is an **odd** number, and thus it constructively interferes with itself at the location of the emitting atom.\n\n6b) The neighboring atom is at the right distance such that the photoelectron has traveled n/2 wavelengths, where n is an **even** number, and thus it *de*structively interferes with itself at the location of the emitting atom.\n\n7a) The superposition of the wavefunctions of the emitting atom and the scattered photoelectron means that the electron density at that location is higher and therefore the x-ray absorption coefficient is higher (more likely to absorb x-rays).\n\n7b) The superposition of the wavefunctions of the emitting atom and the scattered photoelectron mean that the electron density at that location is lower and therefore the x-ray absorption coefficient is lower (less likely to absorb x-rays).\n\nAs you increase energy of the x-rays slightly, the energy of the emitted photo electron increases with it. This means that the photoelectron has a shorter wavelength. This changes the n/2 value mentioned above (because the atoms are nominally not moving relative to each other). This results in a variation between constructive (absorbing) interference and destructive (non-absorbing) interference as you increase energy. This is the \"ripples\" in the structure of the absorption spectrum above the edge. \n\nNow, why did I go into this to try and answer your question? Well, if the electron were behaving as a ball bouncing around, this process wouldn't work. It is the fact that the electron is emitted as a spherical wave, and that it can interact with all the neighboring atoms that allows this technique to work and to provide us information about how many neighboring atoms there are, how far away they are, and what type of atom they are.\n\n\n**TL;DR**: electrons aren't just particles and therefore don't have well defined locations."], [11, "Very small things behave in very strange ways\n\nOver years of study and experiment, equations have been discovered that very accurately predict the results of experiment.

The particle/wave aspects come into play when we humans wish to use a simplifying model to think about a particular aspect of their behavior. In general, it's best to think of electrons around an atom as waves, not particles. The positively charged nucleus creates a potential energy well (like a gravity well around a massive object) that electrons fall into, where they exist as standing waves. These standing waves are constrained by quantum mechanics such that each harmonic is allowed to be occupied by one electron with a specific spin alignment (of which there are 2). These are orbitals, spherical harmonics which stack on top of the nucleus, each able to hold 2 electrons (due to spin alignment). The idea of an electron as a tiny billiard ball zooming around in a literal circular orbit around a nucleus is almost completely wrong."], [3, "The OP, like a lot of people, finds the idea that particles do not have definite states, only probabilities, so crazy that it must be wrong, and believes that there must be a definite \"hidden state\" which we have trouble measuring.  The OP is not alone: I suspect everyone who's ever studied quantum mechanics has had the same feeling.  If this *doesn't* freak you out, then as Neils Bohr said, \"Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.\"\n\nThe question is, what do you do when shocked by an idea?  You can dismiss it out of hand, as contrary to your mental model of how the world works, or accept that your mental model might be wrong, and look for experiments which *test* the idea.\n\nAnd as other posters have pointed out, many *many* experiments have been done to test this idea, and they all say that no, the world does not work the way the OP thinks it does.  Unfortunately, the experiments verifying \"Bell's Inequality\" are much harder to understand than the basic idea, so a lot of people are told the assertion but never shown the proof.\n\nThis idea that the world is fundamentally probabilistic is as shocking and unbelievable to us as the idea that the Earth rotated around the Sun was to medieval scholars, but it is just as correct, just as well verified, and even harder to prove to a layperson.

If we study quantum physics, we cannot do math with observables in the same way as in classical mechanics. You have to really consider non-commutative algebra, which also has a fundamental impact on probability theory (it ultimately leads to phenomena such as interference).

Indeed, instead of just \"all heads\" or \"all tails\", there are many other ways a sequence can end -- e.g. HTHTHTHTH..., HHTHHTHHT..., or even some \"pattern\" that's just non-repeating sequence of heads and tails. There are in fact [uncountably many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set) possibilities. [2]\n\n1.

Indeed, instead of just \"all heads\" or \"all tails\", there are many other ways a sequence can end -- e.g. HTHTHTHTH..., HHTHHTHHT..., or even some \"pattern\" that's just non-repeating sequence of heads and tails. There are in fact [uncountably many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set) possibilities. [2]\n\n1. In the standard formalism of probability theory, having your sequence of coin flips eventually be all heads is what's called a \"tail event\". Interestingly, there's a principle called [Kolmogorov's zero-one law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%27s_zero%E2%80%93one_law) which says that the probability of a tail event must be either zero or one. [3]\n\n1. As you say, by symmetry, the chance of ending with all heads should be the same as the chance of ending with all tails (or with any other tail pattern). This means the chance can not be 100%, so according to the above principle, the chance could only be 0%. \n\n[1] Specifically, the typical meaning is that the flips have order type \u03c9, the first infinite [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number). One could also imagine different ways of doing infinitely many flips, but according to our usual conceptions about time, these involve infinitely many flips happening in a finite span of time, as opposed to, say, one every second for the rest of eternity. \n\n[2] As a fun digression, thinking about \"the set of all tails of sequences\" is part of the resolution of a [fanciful version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_and_hats_puzzle#Countably_Infinite-Hat_Variant_without_Hearing) of the prisoners and hats problem.\n\n[3] Word of warning: For this principle to apply, it's a bit more technical than one might expect to define exactly what is meant by a \"tail event\", but the definition does apply here.", "id": "d45sn5a"}, {"comment": "Wow, great reply.

Imagine you had a sequence x(1), x(2) , x(3).... Could you have a sequence where both an infinite number are odd and an infinite number are even? Yes, of course, set x(1) = 1, x(2) = 2, x(3) = 3 and so on. Infinite number of odd, infinite number of evens. So lets take the sets of x(2n+1) and x(2n) (odd and even).

Same set size as natural numbers, but there is an infinite sequence of odds, and an infinite sequence of evens. Infinity is just so gosh darn big. \n\nIndeed my argument was presented as infinitely many infinite series for presentation of idea as constructing a collection of infinite number of sequences is easier to immediately comprehend then saying take the first 1/10 of the indicies of an infinite sequence. The second sounds like non sense. But, for completeness allow me to outline a similar argument.\n\nIn the case of a single sequence, consider the expected longest consecutive streak of heads for n flips. Clearly as n gets larger, you expect the longest sequence of consecutive sequences to grow as well. Indeed for any sequence of heads the next one is 50/50 heads, thus if you would expect a run of k in n flips, you could expect 2 separate runs of k in 2*n flips, and one of those you would expect to actually be a run of k+1. I would then use recursion to show simply that if you let the number of trials grow exponentially (2^n) you would expect a linear increase in the expected longest run of heads. Or in other words the longest consecutive sequence of heads grows at log_2 (n). Thus showing that you actually would expect any single infinite sequence to contain an infinite sequence of consecutive heads.\n\nI simply chose the first method for discussion purposes as I felt it was a clearer argument.

To do this, just compute sin(pi/3) and then use the half-angle formula as much as you want to compute sin(pi/3x2^(k)) and so pi will be approximately 3x2^(k)sin(pi/3x2^(k)). Archimedes did this up to 96. If you can approximate square roots well by hand, then this is pretty fun because it's very clearly from basic principles about pi being the circumference of a circle of diameter 1. What you're doing is inscribing a regular polygon with N sides into such a circle, and you can use trig to show that each side has length sin(pi/N), so the total perimeter is Nsin(pi/N). The more sides you put in, the closer the regular polygon approximates a circle, so you get the limit. In fact, if you also draw a polygon that fits onto the outside of the circle, it's sides will have length tan(pi/N), so pi is also the limit of Ntan(pi/N). In general, Nsin(pi/N) < pi < Ntan(pi/N), with everything equal in the limit.\n\nBut this can get a lot of nested roots pretty quick, which may or may not be attractive. If this fails, then you can compute [Leibniz Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80) up to some term to get an approximation. But this is a fairly slow and boring way to do it.\n\nA very advanced and fast converging formula for pi is given by [Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan%E2%80%93Sato_series), it's what computers still use today (I think...) but can still be done by hand to get pretty good approximations. It's good because you'll get a lot of decimals very quickly, but it's just plugging and chugging into a formula, so not really that fun. Additionally, it's derivation is super complex, using Modular Forms and Ramanujan's God-Like intuition, so you'll just have to take it as a black-box.\n\nAll of these can be done with pen-paper. If you want lots of terms really quickly, then Ramanujan is the way to go. If you want to compute it using first-principles and geometric reasoning, then using half-angle formulas and sin or tan is the way to go.", "id": "d0zb3s1"}, {"comment": "I'm not a math guy but when I need to use pi in programming, a lot of times pi is something I have to create from scratch.

It turns out that if I know the crust-length of just one slice of pizza that has been cut to make N equal slices, then I can figure out the crust-length of any slice of pizza that has been cut to make M equal slices. That is, if I know how much crust a slice will have when we slice the  pie up among 8 people, then I'll know how much crust a slice will have if we slice the pie up among 29 people.

For example, think of polynomials (equations like Ax^2 + Bx + C) and their roots (ie: x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 has roots x = 2, x = 1 because if you plug either of these in, you get zero).  \n\nWe can find polynomials with roots that are rational (fractions) or negative (ie: 2x^3 + 5x^2 \u2013 28x \u2013 15 has roots x = 3, x = -5, and x = -1/2).  We can even find polynomials with *irrational* roots like with x^2 - 2 = 0, then x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2).  So we can have 'puzzle pieces' of many shapes and sizes, including irrational numbers.  \n\nWhat about \u03c0?  Can we design a puzzle (polynomial) so that \u03c0 is a solution?  Nope.  Well, not if we stick to the types of puzzles we've been using (specifically, polynomials in one variable with coefficients as whole numbers).  This is because \u03c0 is what we call a **Transcendental number**.  No matter how hard you try and how complicated you make your polynomial, you will never be able to 'fit' the \u03c0 'puzzle piece' in.  The most well-known transcendental numbers are \u03c0 and e, but there are many (infinite) others and it's very much non-trivial to prove if a number is transcendental (if not, we say it's algebraic).\n\n---\n\nTo touch on another point you made in your previous comment, you asked: \n\n>Maybe humans are using the wrong counting system?\n\nWhich is a great mindset to have when thinking of irrational numbers.  Seemingly you understand that it's possible and normal to calculate both integers and rational numbers by hand.  We can use a ruler to measure a foot or even 7/8ths of a foot, but not \u03c0 feet or sqrt(2) feet.  These were things that the ancient greeks had great difficulty accepting.\n\nIn order to think of these numbers we cannot simply live in the world of rational numbers, we have to expand our world to what we call the Real numbers.  Once we do this, it's very hard to say that we're still using a 'counting system'. \n\nThe natural numbers / integers are essentially defined by their property of counting.  What comes after 1? 2.  What comes after the number that comes after 1? 3.  We can use this to 'count' through every single number without missing a single one.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but you can do this with the rational numbers as well: [Diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Diagonal_argument.svg/230px-Diagonal_argument.svg.png).  Basically write out all of the fractions listed in rows by their denominators and follow through the diagonal pattern in the diagram.  This lets you 'count' through the rationals, as we can say, \"what's the n^th number you came across when doing this?\"\n\nWe cannot do this with the real numbers.  If I told you to start at 1, how would you find the real number that comes after 1?  You can't, because there's always a number *closer* to one than the number you chose.  1.00000000001?  How about 1.0000000000000000000000001?  There's no way to 'count' through them.  \n\nWhich is why we call them 'uncountable'.  In fact, while there are infinitely many whole numbers and rational numbers, there are **more** infinitely many Real numbers.  By jumping from the rationals to the reals (often called completion of the rationals), we have suddenly made a jump in **sizes of infinity**.  The proof of this is [Cantor's diagonalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) and is a pretty awesome proof.  That might not be the best link for it, though.\n\nSo, it's not that humans are using the *wrong* counting method and that's why we can't count/calculate numbers like \u03c0. It's more that there **is no way to count** the real numbers, and thus there is no counting method that does what you want it to do.\n\n---\n\nThat ends my math rant.", "id": "d0zqrkt"}, {"comment": "We can \"measure\" pi.

In other words, the \"problem\" is that our way of representing numbers using integers doesn't work for irrational numbers like pi. But we could just as easily set up a numeral system where pi is the base, in which case pi = 10. Of course, for the vast majority of applications, we'd rather our numeral system used an integer base, as while base-pi might be good for representing pi neatly, it wouldn't be so useful for everyday tasks like counting.\n\nHowever, in our decimal system, there are plenty of ways to approximate pi (as a decimal expansion, fraction, or as a partial sum), and in symbolic calculations, we just give pi its own symbol, which represents pi's exact location on the number line. We get by just fine.", "id": "d0zfuxp"}, {"comment": "I find this question very interesting, and am going to answer from what I know as en undergraduate in physics. I hope someone will correct me if I say something wrong.\n\n-------------------------\n\nOne of the definition of Pi is *the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter*. This definitions makes it pretty clear that Pi, defined as such, has a clearly defined value.\n\nIf in another world you were to change the way you're counting, and multiplied every number by the 2 ; then instead of saying \"hey, I ate one apple yesterday!\" you would say something like \"hey, I ate two apples yesterday!\". This number two being the unit of counting ; everyone would understand that you ate what, we in our world, call one apple.\n\nIn this hypothetical world, if you were to measure the circumference of a circle and divide it by it's diameter, you would end up with the value 3.14159 which is Pi. At this point, I think we need to take a moment to understand what's happening.\n\nIn this other world, they say 2 when we say 1. If they took a circle with a diameter of 2 *in their world*, we would say it is 1. The circumference of this circle *for them* would be 6.28318 and *we* would measure it as 3.14159. The circle did not change, it's just the way you count. Pi stays the same ; because it is defined as a *ratio*. If in our world, we took their values and computed, we would find Pi. If in their world they took our values and computed, they would find Pi. Of course, we can't mix their and our values as those are not using the same unit.\n\nWe could, however, use the conversion factor of two, to communicante our measurements.\n\n----------------\n\nThe conversion factors leads us to other constants, the mass of the electron, for instance. From Wikipedia, I have the value 9.109\u00d710^-31 kg.\n\nThe kilogram is defined as being equal to the mass of the *International Prototype of the Kilogram* (IPK).\n\nIf in another world, you were to define the mass of the electron as 1 u *(u sands for units, we'll get back to it later)* ; then this IPK would weight 1.097*10^27 u (That is 1 / (9.109\u00d710^-31 )).\n\nHere again, the actual objects (IPK or electron) do not change ; just the way you count. However, the value of the mass of the electron is defined as the answer to *how many amount of [insert unit of mass] do you need to build one electron ?*\n\nClearly, the definition is dependent of the unit of mass. The value of mass of the electron can either be 1 or 9.109\u00d710^-31 ; depending if you speak in u, or if you speak in kg.\n\nThe difference between Pi and the mass of the electron is that, one is dependent of a unit (electron) but not the other (Pi).\n\nIf I'm working with an equation, I can't have a phone call with an alien and ask him the value of the mass of the electron to replace in my formula.\n\n> [YOU] - *Hey, I'm working on an equation right now, how much does an electron weight in your units of mass ?*\n\n> [E.T] - *It's pretty easy, we chose it to be one !*\n\n> [YOU] - *Oh, clever thank you !* ^replaces ^every ^m_electron ^in ^the ^formula ^with ^1\n\nThis does not work because, if you replace a physical value with the number, you have to take care of the unit. For instance, 4 m/s divided by 2 s does not gives 2. It gives 2 m/s^2 (which is twice the unit of acceleration). This is why physics teachers in high school are so annoying with the units when you give a numeral answer: 2 m/s^2 are definitely not 2 bananas.\n\nAs you saw above, when doing calculations, units multiply or divide, and must stay in the result.\n\n- 1 N * 1 m = 1 N*m\n- 1 km / 1 h = 1 km/h\n- 1 A * 1 V = 1 A*V = 1 W (sometimes, composed units have an other name)\n- 1 banana / 1 day = 1 banana/day\n- 3 km / 2 km = 3/2 (Units can simplify, just like (2*3)/2 = 3/1)\n\n---------------\n\nLet's look back at the definition of Pi now. We said *the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter*. Their is something hidden here!\n\nHow long is the diameter of the circle ? It's 1.5 ? Nope: it's 1.5 centimeter = 1.5 cm = 15 mm.\n\nWhat about it's circumference ? 4.712 ? Nope again: 4.712 cm or 47.12 mm. (Approximation here)\n\nSo, what about Pi ? Pi = 4.712 cm / 1.5 cm = 4.712 / 1.5 = Pi (Or not so far from Pi, because I used 4.712 instead of 1.5*Pi)\n\nAs you see now, Pi has no units because it's defined as such. And it is, therefore, not dependent on the way you count. Because the way you count is the unit you are using.\n\n---------------\n\nThis is where I wanted to end. Numbers that are defined as having no units are the number they are, you can't do anything about it.\n\nYou can call your E.T friend and ask him to tell you how much is *the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter* and he will tell you Pi.\n\nYou can't ask him how old he his, because if he tells you \"I'm 154\", you don't know 154 what. If he answers you \"I'm 154 Earth's years old\" then you understand how old he is. If he tells you \"I'm 154 Pluto's years old\" you understand what he means, because you can *convert it* to Earth's years.\n\n--------------- \n\nI hope this is comprehensible. Again, I'm explaining this being an undergraduate: I hope their are no mistakes. If anyone has to correct/add/clarify something, I hope he will!\n\nThank you for reading.

So no, it doesn't change. At least, that's the way we look at it in physics, as far as I know.\n\nThe ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter _does_ change in curved space, though. It's only equal to pi in flat space. That's just one of many physical and geometrical formulas that apply in flat space(time) which would require changes in curved space(time): for example, surface area of a sphere wouldn't be 4\u03c0r^(2) in curved spacetime, which means gravity and electric fields wouldn't quite follow the inverse square law, magnetic fields around a wire wouldn't quite be proportional to I/2\u03c0r, and so on.", "id": "d0zc8yk"}, {"comment": "Well, \u03c0 is the number 3.1415..., and one definition is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle in Euclidean geometry. So it depends what you mean by calculating \u03c0 for a curved space. There is a way to define an analog of \u03c0 for an arbitrary 2-dimensional normed vector space X with induced metric *d*. The \"pi-constant\" \u03c0*_(X,d)_* (note that it depends on the space and the metric) can roughly be defined as the ratio of the length of the unit circle to its diameter. Some care has to be taken in exactly how this is defined. For more information, you can check out [this StackExchange post](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/254620/pi-in-arbitrary-metric-spaces) since I would just end up repeating exactly what they have there anyway.\n\nWith the proper definitions, you can show, for instance, that the pi-constant for R^(2) with the usual Euclidean L^(2)-norm is just the familiar number 3.1415.... For the taxicab metric (the L^(1) metric), you can show that the pi-constant is 4. Interestingly, for any L^(p)-norm, the pi-constant is between \u03c0 and 4, with the global minimum of \u03c0 being achieved only for the L^(2)-metric. Indeed, if *p* and *q* are conjugate exponents, \u03c0*_p_* = \u03c0*_q_*. Hence the global maximum of 4 is achieved only for L^(1)-metric and L^(\u221e)-metric.\n\n***Note:*** None of these spaces are *curved*. For one, since the definition above makes sense only for normed vector spaces, all of the spaces, considered as differentiable manifolds, are actually flat. No curvature at all. The reason you don't really need curvature to get different pi-constants is that you really only need to have different notions of distance, length, etc. There are plenty of flat metric spaces that are not isometric. In a curved manifold, however, defining the pi-constant would be much more difficult. For one, the obvious analog for 2-dimensional surfaces would not really be a constant, but rather depend on the center of the \"circle\". The reason we use a normed vector space in the definition I gave is so that all circles of radius *R* are isometric to each other.\n", "id": "d0zchro"}, {"comment": "If you'd like to view it this way, you can imagine Pi being the *result* of curving space.

If someone warps or adds any sort of function to manipulate this straight line (and this warp leaves the circumference in tact) we will no longer get our 3.14...\n\nThe best way I can think of it is that you have a circle, and the diameter normally is a straight line from A to B.  You're asking if you draw a squiggly line from A to B instead of a straight line if the ratio between the circumference and the length of your squiggly line will be different than the ratio using a straight line.  It most definitely will since the straight line is the shortest, and any variation in that line will change the ratio!\n\n*edit*: I also wanted to mention how a \"sphere\" is simply a circle rotated about an axis.

So there is no *the* ratio of c/d. However, when things depend on distance like this, we can get a *local* measure of a quantity by taking limits. Let P be any point in space and pi(d,P) be circumference over the diameter for a \"circle\" of diameter d drawn at the point P. Everything is well defined, so pi(d,P) makes sense. But if d is big, then pi(d,P) does not really tell me much about the point P, but about things that are a distance d/2 from the point P. I don't want this. What we can do to fix this is look at the limit of pi(d,P) as d approaches zero. Let's call this pi(P) and this will tell us what pi looks like \"near P\". It turns out that we'll *always* have pi(P)=pi~3.14159...\n\nWhat this means is that, while pi(d,P) may vary from point-to-point or diameter-to-diameter, it is \"locally-constant\" and equal to the ordinary pi. This is a consequence of the fact that we get curved spaces by gluing together a bunch of *flat* spaces. So while the global nature of the space can be really wacky, this says that as we zoom into each point we'll get familiar flat-space.

Temperature is not defined as the average kinetic energy of some collection of particles. Temperature can actually be defined in a few ways. In statistical mechanics, the temperature of a collection of particles is the derivative of the entropy with respect to internal energy. Then when we pass to the thermodynamic limit, temperature turns out to be proportional to the average particle kinetic energy *for a certain class of collections only* (e.g., an ideal gas). This is the most commonly known definition of temperature.\n\nAnother definition of temperature is as follows. All systems of particles emit electromagnetic radiation, across a range of possible frequencies. For a general system, we may describe the possible frequencies by a distribution *u*(v), which gives the energy per unit volume per unit frequency interval. (Or sometimes we talk about the spectral radiance, which would be the power emitted per unit area of the system, per unit solid angle, per unit frequency. It doesn't really matter; we can easily swap between all such descriptions.) Now if that system of particles is in *thermal equilibrium* (itself a concept defined axiomatically in thermodynamics), then the distribution of frequencies has a very specific form. That form is given by *Planck's Law* and a system that has such a spectral distribution is said to be a *black body*. (Note that there are systems which very obviously do not follow Planck's Law, for instance, a monochromatic laser.)\n\nThe black body frequency distribution has the same form for all black bodies, but it depends on a single non-negative parameter *T*. It can be shown that the number *T* is just the thermodynamic temperature of that body. Now... we can also turn this around. Suppose we had a collection of particles whose emitted radiation had the form of Planck's Law. Then we define its temperature to be that parameter *T* which gives the frequency distribution. Note that this definition of *T* extends our previous definition of temperature because it makes sense even for systems of particles we would not normally describe by classical thermodynamics (e.g., a collection of photons).\n\n> ...how does the vacuum of space have a temperature?\n\nOkay, so what does this have to do with the temperature of space? For a period shortly before the recombination era (about 380,000 years after the big bang), all matter (protons, electrons, alpha particles, photons, etc.) were all hanging around each other in one big plasma soup. The thermal radiation is more or less a result of the particles in the plasma colliding with each other, transferring momentum, transferring energy, etc. The photons themselves are also being scattered, absorbed, emitted, etc. So each of the constituents of this plasma soup were in thermal equilibrium, and they each emitted radiation according to Planck's Law. Thus each of the constituents had a well-defined temperature.\n\nThis would have continued, if not for the expansion of the universe. Once the universe expands enough so that the average length a photon has to travel before interacting with ordinary matter is greater than or equal to the length scale of the universe, the photons are said to have decoupled from matter.\n\n(There are some details here that I have left out for the sake of clarity. But essentially what happened was that the universe expanded enough so that electrons and protons combined so much to form hydrogen, called recombination, that there were not a high enough density of free electrons for *Thomson scattering* to occur. So photons were able to just travel and go on their merry way and interact with free electrons only very rarely. This is called photon decoupling.)\n\nThose photons that were in thermal equilibrium with ordinary matter but which later decoupled today consist of the CMB (cosmic microwave background). At the time of recombination, those photons had a temperature *T*, as defined earlier. As the universe expands, the photons undergo redshift. It can be shown that a collection of photons in thermal equilibrium that undergoes a uniform redshift is *also* a collection of photons in thermal equilibrium, albeit at a lower temperature. (Note that this is not immediately obvious since you first have to show that such a redshifted collection still has a spectral radiance distribution given by Planck's Law.) Intuitively, you can think of it this way. As space expands, all wavelengths, including those of the CMB photons, are stretched by some factor *a*. This causes an apparent redshift, which means the energy of the photons decreases. That energy can be expressed in terms of the temperature *T*. If energy decreases, so does the temperature.\n\nSo when we say that the CMB has a temperature of 2.7 K, we mean that the radiation from the CMB is thermal radiation that follows Planck's Law with parameter *T* = 2.7 K.\n\n---\n\n**(Side comment:)** Neutrinos were also in that primordial plasma soup. But because they do not interact via the electromagnetic force, they decoupled from photons and ordinary matter earlier than the recombination era. So there should *also* be a cosmic neutrino background. We can even work out what the temperature should be, and it's about 1.9 K. (Notice that it is colder than the CMB because neutrinos decoupled earlier.) Alas, we have not directly detected this background as of today. The CNB will likely never be directly detected.

Luckily, we have the truthy website of Wikipedia to help us. The set of rules that define what a number is and how they interact are the [Peano Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms). After working informally with an object long enough, we want to figure out what are the smallest number of rules and assumptions we have to make in order to get everything we like about the objects. These set of rules are called Axioms, and they cannot be broken down or reduced any further so can be thought of as the elementary particles of math.\n\nLet's look at all the Peano axioms and see if they say that zero is a natural number:\n\n1.) Zero is a natural number\n\n2.) For every natural number N, N=N\n\n3.) For every pair of natural numbers N and M, if N=M then M=N\n\n4.) For every three natural numbers N,M,K, if N=M and M=K then N=K\n\n5.) If N is a natural number and N=M, then M is a natural number\n\n6.) For every natural number N, there is a unique number called S(N), called the successor of N\n\n7.) For every pair of natural number N and M, N=M if and only if S(N)=S(M)\n\n8.) There is no natural number N so that S(N)=0 (0 is Zero).\n\n9.) If A is a set of natural numbers that contains zero and if N is in A, then so is S(N), then A is the set of all natural numbers.\n\nWe could have stopped at 1.), because the first and most important rule of the natural numbers is that zero is a number. These rules allow us to figure out absolutely everything we know about numbers. They're super important and completely invented by Peano in order to create a system where all the properties of numbers that we want follow naturally.

One says 'here are these axioms. If a mathematical object satisfies these axioms, what does that tell us about it?' In this case, the axiomisation is the real numbers says 'if you have a Dedekind-complete totally ordered field, you should call it a model of the real numbers'. \n\nAnd in fact, every model of those axioms (object that satisfies them) is in a sense the same as every other model.\n\n---\n\nThere are a number of popular models of the real numbers.\n\nOne of the easiest to understand is to treat a real number as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers in some way. For example, you can think of the square root of 2 as being the limit of the sequence {1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, 1.41421, ...} where each element of the sequence is required to be within one extra decimal place in accuracy when squared to 2. That's a simplified explanation, but it might explain how the reals are constructed.\n\nOf course, in order to say you've constructed the reals (or to be more accurate, that you've constructed a model of the above axiomisation), you have to prove that your process produces a field, and that you can define an ordering (something that takes two objects, x and y, and tells you whether x < y) such that under that ordering your field is totally ordered and Dedekind-complete. Part of that (the field part) involves proving that your model has the property that for all x and y, xy = yx. "], [3, "This is known as the commutative property.

This is a complicated property of the material, which you can tell by the fact that we measure hardness in dimensionless scales, i.e. we only measure the hardness relative to other objects rather than defining it with a real unit. So let's actually get away from hardness and talk about some properties that are more quantifiable.\n\nA concept related to hardness is stiffness, which we can measure as the Young's modulus of a material and it has units of pressure. We can measure the stiffness by plotting the stress vs. strain for a material. A stiff material has a very high slope on a [stress-strain curve](http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/iss/kap_3/illustr/stress_strain_brittle_2.gif). By this measure, diamond has a very high slope (Young's modulus), about 5-6 times as high as steel. \n\nSo why does the diamond break before the steel does? Because it is brittle. Although it doesn't deform much in response to strain initially, once a rupture starts it spreads and the diamond cleaves. Steel may be softer, but it is also ductile.

So diamonds are the hardest material, but that isn't very useful up against a hydraulic press, although is against a knife.\n\nA good comparison is glass. If you drop or hit a sheet of glass, it's going to break, because it isn't very tough. If you applied a large amount of pressure to it, it would perform better, but still not that well compared to other things. \n\nHowever, have you tried cutting or sawing glass before?

[Diamond can resist up to 2800 MPa before braking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength). That's harder than steel, but it's still a finite number that can be exceeded.\n\nWhen you apply a force compressing a material, it deforms a little bit until elastic forces counteract the force that you're applying (you can see it in the slow motion part of the video). As long as you don't exceed the *yield strength* the object will return to its original shape when the compressing force ceases. If you do exceed that then it will undergo plastic deformation, which means it heats up a bit and it won't return to its original shape. Even more force, exceeding the *ultimate strength*, means it will shatter into pieces.\n\nYield and ultimate strength are defined on *stress*, which is force divided by cross-section area. It's much simpler than it sounds: a thick column can resist more weight than a thin column. In this video it was a very small diamond under a giant hydraulic press.\n\nIf diamond is harder than steel it means a diamond column can resist more weight (or more pressure in only one direction) than a steel column. But if the load is big enough of course it will no longer resist.\n\nEdit: I focused on ultimate strength and material failure since that's what's relevant in a video about a diamond shattering into pieces.

At some point during the pressing, some unlucky carbon atoms will have such a great force on them that it becomes easier to split apart from one another, than it is to stay together.\n\n**Bonus**: Diamond's rigid and inflexible crystal is also the reason it has the highest speed of sound at over 26,000 mph (air has ~700 mph or something)\n\nTl;dr: Diamond's carbon crystal makeup is particularly rigid and inflexible.

Cleavage, in mineralogy, is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along definite crystallographic planes(= highly ordered structure, occurring due to the intrinsic nature of its constituents to form symmetric patterns).

Diamonds are one of the hardest materials according to the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. A hydraulic press is not a material it is a machine using hydraulics for the generation, control, and transmission of power by the use of pressurized liquids. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is a qualitative (=not easily quantifiable) ordinal scale (=numerical 1,2,3) that characterizes the scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material.

It's more to do with the structure of the crystal than the individual atom to atom bonds.\nThe carbon atoms in a diamond are held in place extremely rigidly. If you imagine a perfect cube of diamond and nudge an atom in the middle, it will hardly budge. You could break that atom off, but it wouldn't flex much before doing so.

You could flex it up or down, or side to side, but try and pull it against the rope axially, and it wont budge. Now imagine a second ball tied to all four walls, and the roof and the floor. This second ball is like the diamond.

Since the weight is only supported by a small area, very few atom-atom bonds share the load, and the strength of those individual bonds is exceeded.

But, since this is the real world, the surfaces are really only in contact at a few points, and the load is only distributed to a few carbon-carbon bonds.\n\nTLDR: Material hardness is nice, it keeps individual atoms from getting broken off; but on a macro scale object, that same property causes loads to be concentrated in a small area.", "id": "d35hmxl"}, {"comment": "Thanks, that description was really easy to follow!", "id": "d35i4l7"}, {"comment": "Good question.

Because all atoms are very restricted in all directions and can't move, physical force gets passed along rather than absorbed (=turned into movement).

So let's actually get away from hardness and talk about some properties that are more quantifiable.\n\nA concept related to hardness is stiffness, which we can measure as the Young's modulus of a material and it has units of pressure. We can measure the stiffness by plotting the stress vs. strain for a material. A stiff material has a very high slope on a [stress-strain curve](http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/iss/kap_3/illustr/stress_strain_brittle_2.gif).

That's harder than steel, but it's still a finite number that can be exceeded.\n\nWhen you apply a force compressing a material, it deforms a little bit until elastic forces counteract the force that you're applying (you can see it in the slow motion part of the video). As long as you don't exceed the *yield strength* the object will return to its original shape when the compressing force ceases. If you do exceed that then it will undergo plastic deformation, which means it heats up a bit and it won't return to its original shape. Even more force, exceeding the *ultimate strength*, means it will shatter into pieces.\n\nYield and ultimate strength are defined on *stress*, which is force divided by cross-section area. It's much simpler than it sounds: a thick column can resist more weight than a thin column. In this video it was a very small diamond under a giant hydraulic press.\n\nIf diamond is harder than steel it means a diamond column can resist more weight (or more pressure in only one direction) than a steel column. But if the load is big enough of course it will no longer resist.\n\nEdit: I focused on ultimate strength and material failure since that's what's relevant in a video about a diamond shattering into pieces.

In this frame the time taken is AB/gamma c where gamma is the lorentz factor which is infinite at a velocity of c so the time is 0.\n\nThen there comes the false conclusion, since the photon travels from A to B at c and our frame of reference goes from A to B at c then they must be the same frame of reference so the proper time of the photons journey is also 0.\n\nThey ignore the fact that if you take a change of reference of something moving at c into any other frame, including one which is also moving at c then it will continue to move at c. The photon is not at rest in the second frame, it continues to propagate at the speed of light.\n\nIt is always a mistake to draw conclusions based then on what a random frame experiences when moving at c wrt to another frame and what light 'experiences'.\n\nHere is a counter thought experiment:\n\nSuppose you have a radio antenna and a receiver set up some distance apart. At the antenna you emit a radio wave with a wavelength of gamma. The receiver is 100.5 wavelengths away precisely. So in the lab frame the radio wave oscillates 100.5 times before being picked up. The odd number of wavelengths means that if the antenna starts by driving an electron 'up' then the electric field of the em wave will start by being orientated up and then oscillate down and up and so on, when it arrives at the antenna the field will be pointed down and as such a corresponding electron will move up.\n\nNow suppose there was a frame of reference of a photon and in that frame the time travelled was 0. This means the electric field that was initially pointing 'up' has no time to switch to down and as such arrives at the receiver pointing 'up' which sends an electron 'down'.\n\nWhich frame of reference is right? While you can change distances and times and angles and energies and such by switching frame of references, no observer should disagree on this result, did the receiver electron first move up or first move down.\n\nEM waves oscillate as they move through space, this is inconsistent with the idea that photons have a lifetime of 0.

A rope is a little different because it's most likely made out of chains of polymers which are long molecules, but hopefully the gas analogy gives you the idea. \n\nIn an ideal gas (air is nearly ideal) each gas molecule has a random velocity. Each time a collision occurs, the molecules bounce off each other in an elastic collision, meaning that all the energy stays with the two molecules - but the molecules may exchange energy so that each molecule comes away from the collision with a different speed and heading. \n\nThe average velocity of the molecules is zero (in the absence of wind or sound) - the molecules bounce around . The average speed of the molecules is more or less what we call the speed of sound.  It depends on the square root of the temperature of the gas (the measure of the kinetic energy of the gas) divided by the square root of the weight of the gas molecule. \n\nNow if you hit a drum at the end of a long tunnel, the air molecules that bounce off the drum will come away with their original (reflected) velocity plus the velocity of the drum at the time of impact. The air molecule moves a bit faster now and so when it impacts another molecule, it transfers more energy to it. Meanwhile the drum starts moving in the opposite direction and collides with other molecules that come away with a reduced velocity. This is what we call sound. The molecules continue to collide with each other and transfer the excess or dearth of kinetic energy. Since all of these molecules are moving, on average, at the speed of sound, the chain of collisions that have to happen before the sound reaches an observer at the end of the tunnel takes a finite amount of time.\n\nIf you know the speed of sound and the time of flight, you can measure the length of the tunnel (sonar).

The 'explosion' is actually the liquid rapidly boiling and turning to steam, which, well, kinda explodes as the volume rapidly increases.

You can probably even feel this if you hold the container as you add the acid to the water.\n\nIt's not that there will always be an explosion or that adding acid to water will 100% guarantee **no** explosion, but the safest way is acid-->water rather than water-->acid.\n\nThe reason is that water has a high heat capacity and boiling point, compared to acids. The 'explosion' is actually the liquid rapidly boiling and turning to steam, which, well, kinda explodes as the volume rapidly increases. If you are adding water to the acid, the lower heat capacity of the acid means that it is more prone to this boiling/explosion, because you're generating the same amount of energy either way, but it takes less energy to boil the acid.\n\nOn top of that, usually, you're adding a smaller amount of acid to a larger amount of water. By adding the acid to the water, you have a larger reservoir that is able to absorb and disperse the heat of mixing without boiling.\n\nThis is the same reason you're told to take care mixing acids and bases, as it's a very exothermic reaction. Likewise, when you are mixing acid into another solvent, such as methanol, you need to take a good deal of caution. In this example, with methanol, the heat capacity is significantly lower than water, so it is much more apt to explode.\n\nNow, that being said, \"adding acid to water\" isn't a fool-proof way to be safe. Very strong acids, such as concentrated sulfuric acid, have a very very high heat of mixing. So, just to dilute sulfuric acid, you need to put your water on ice to cool it, and then slowly add the acid. It probably takes me an hour to make 100-200 mL of 67% sulfuric acid (from a 98% stock), because I have to cool the water, then batch-wise add sulfuric acid, giving the solution several minutes to cool between each 10-20mL addition of sulfuric acid.", "id": "d6xn2gt"}, {"comment": "Thank you for pointing out that it's not the neutralization, it's the dissolution itself.", "id": "d6yz2di"}]]], "441gqq": ["If you \"could\" cut hole through the center of the earth, all the way through.

Why not more or less?", "2016-05-10 02:00:47", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4ilzx4/why_is_the_speed_of_light_precisely_299792458/", [[25, "I'll just copy and past my response to the same question a few months ago ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3ud1ki/why_is_the_speed_of_light_299_792_458_ms_in_a/))\n\nThe numerical value of the speed of light is totally arbitrary, and not a directly measurable thing. The only reason that we think of the speed of light as a dimensionful constant with a particular value is because historically humans have insisted on measuring time and space with different units. In light of relativity, time and space should be seen to be the same sort of thing, so it really only makes sense to measure them using the same units. \n\nIf you measure time and space with the same units, the speed of light is just \"1\", a dimensionless constant, and all slower speeds are just fractions of the speed of light. This is analogous to if you had a topographical map of a place and insisted on measuring distances along the north/south axis in kilometers but distances along the east/west axis in miles. This would be a bit of a weird thing to do, although there's nothing *wrong* with it. However, suppose your friend had their own map of the same area, but their axes were tiled with respect to yours, and they also insisted on measuring up/down on their map in kilometers while they measured left/right in miles. Now, if you tried to transform coordinates of things on your map to their coordinates on your friends map, you would end up with a transformation law that had conversion factors hanging all over the place to account for the fact that your \"kilometers\" direction is tilted with respect to your friends \"kilometers\" direction. This is what the speed of light is, it's just the conversion factor between the units of space and the units of time. If we don't insist on doing a funny thing by using different units, the need for the conversion factor goes away.\n\nHowever, all that being said, it does make sense to say that the speed of light is *very fast*. It seems that clearly if the speed of light were much slower, we would see all kinds of crazy relativistic effects in regular life. But I just spent the last two paragraphs arguing that the value of the speed of light is totally meaningless and arbitrary. How can we reconcile these statements?\n\nThe point is that humans are slow. We care about time scales like seconds, but we care about length scales like meters. These values of distances and times are \"typical human scales\". But, if we express the length of one second in meters (I know, seems weird, but relativity is weird), we get that 1 second = 299 792 458 meters. So a typical human time scale is *huge* compared to a typical human length scale, i.e. we are very slow. So, you can phrase the question \"why is the speed of light a big number\" as \"why are human so slow compared to their size. The answer to that question has much to do with the complicated fundamental and emergent physics that describe our biology and the environments in which we've evolved, and I'm certainly not aware of a simple explanation. "], [3, "Because of the [history of the definitions of the meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_metre).  You can see the full details in the link, but originally it was defined as one ten-millionth of an Earth meridian, and later has been redefined several times.  The most recent definition, from 1983, is this:\n\n* The meter is the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1\u2044299,792,458 of a second.\n\nEach time we redefine a unit, we have to do it in such a way that the new definition is consistent with the old one.  That's where the number 299,792,458 comes from\u2014it's the number they had to pick in order to keep measurements made with the new definition consistent with those made with the older ones.\n\nNote that when they made this change, something a bit mind-bending happened.

Instead we've **decided** that light travels **exactly** 299,792,458 meters per second, and we work backward from that to figure out how long a meter is.  The reason for that is:\n\n1.

For example we say Paris is longitude/latitude 48.8/2.35, or we say the moon is at some location specified by the triplet of numbers (4,7,29). Incidentally these numbers are known as 'coordinates' and are completely arbitrary. The human race could be wiped out tomorrow, but the physical points corresponding to Paris, the moon, etc. would still exist (fight me philosophers). All that would disappear is our human labeling of those points. \n\nWhen we all agree on a standard way to label points we get a system of units. For example we all agree that Paris is at (0,0) and Munich is at (0,841). Again this is completely arbitrary, I could say Munich is at (0,1) and no one could say I am wrong. Then we agree to call the distance between Paris and Munich 841 km and we simply measure the time it takes a light beam to travel between the two cities. That is how you arrive at your final number for the speed of light. It's an arbitrary number because it comes from an arbitrary labeling of points in space."], [1, "Originally, the meter was  a certain fraction of the diameter of the Earth. And the second was a certain fraction of the duration of the Earth's day.\n\nThe numerical value of *c* is a consequence of how long it would take light to travel around the earth (supposing you could get it to do that), expressed as in terms of the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once about its axis."]], [[{"comment": "I'll just copy and past my response to the same question a few months ago ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3ud1ki/why_is_the_speed_of_light_299_792_458_ms_in_a/))\n\nThe numerical value of the speed of light is totally arbitrary, and not a directly measurable thing. The only reason that we think of the speed of light as a dimensionful constant with a particular value is because historically humans have insisted on measuring time and space with different units. In light of relativity, time and space should be seen to be the same sort of thing, so it really only makes sense to measure them using the same units. \n\nIf you measure time and space with the same units, the speed of light is just \"1\", a dimensionless constant, and all slower speeds are just fractions of the speed of light. This is analogous to if you had a topographical map of a place and insisted on measuring distances along the north/south axis in kilometers but distances along the east/west axis in miles. This would be a bit of a weird thing to do, although there's nothing *wrong* with it. However, suppose your friend had their own map of the same area, but their axes were tiled with respect to yours, and they also insisted on measuring up/down on their map in kilometers while they measured left/right in miles. Now, if you tried to transform coordinates of things on your map to their coordinates on your friends map, you would end up with a transformation law that had conversion factors hanging all over the place to account for the fact that your \"kilometers\" direction is tilted with respect to your friends \"kilometers\" direction. This is what the speed of light is, it's just the conversion factor between the units of space and the units of time. If we don't insist on doing a funny thing by using different units, the need for the conversion factor goes away.\n\nHowever, all that being said, it does make sense to say that the speed of light is *very fast*. It seems that clearly if the speed of light were much slower, we would see all kinds of crazy relativistic effects in regular life. But I just spent the last two paragraphs arguing that the value of the speed of light is totally meaningless and arbitrary. How can we reconcile these statements?\n\nThe point is that humans are slow. We care about time scales like seconds, but we care about length scales like meters. These values of distances and times are \"typical human scales\". But, if we express the length of one second in meters (I know, seems weird, but relativity is weird), we get that 1 second = 299 792 458 meters. So a typical human time scale is *huge* compared to a typical human length scale, i.e. we are very slow. So, you can phrase the question \"why is the speed of light a big number\" as \"why are human so slow compared to their size.

I'm certain if I phrased it that way I would get a similar response in terms of time and space being just different manifestations of spacetime. \n\nWhat I mean to ask is: from an inertial reference frame, over an arbitrary unit-independent fixed time interval, why does light travel the specific distance that we measure, and not some other distance? In otherwords, if we were in another hypothetical universe where a second was still a second and a meter was still a meter, why couldn't the speed of light work out to be 10 m/s instead of ~300k?", "id": "d2z88w2"}, {"comment": "In our daily lives, we are used to treating time like an independent parameter and are thus accustomed to defining the velocity of things in some unit of distance per unit of time. Since there is no independent time parameter in 4D spacetime, we can only define 'velocity' in a way that works out to be one unit per unit, or really just one.  You can use whatever unit you want (either time or distance): inches, years, etc.  You can also complicate things and define your coordinate system using different units for different axes.  This allows you to get a different value for your 'velocity' through spacetime. For instance, if you chose inches and centimeters then you would find that your spacetime 'velocity' was 2.54 cm/in.  If you chose miles and feet you would find that it was instead 5280 ft/mi. You could also go with meters and seconds and find that the magnitude of your spacetime velocity is equal to 299,792,458 m/s.  \n  \nThe spacetime velocity I have been referring to is more accurately called the four-velocity and it is the only speed at which anything can 'move' through spacetime because again, we have no independent parameter to measure against.  In your personal frame of reference, you are at rest in the spatial dimensions and thus your four-velocity is pointing in entirely in the timeward direction and you experience yourself moving through time at the rate of one second per second.  For everyone moving relative to you you see some part of their 'motion' through spacetime in the spatial dimensions and thus see them experiencing time at a slightly slower rate, this is the origin of the time dilation effect.  \n  \nLight in a vacuum moves along what is called a null geodesic. The proper time along a null geodesic is 0.  Thus we see all of its 'motion' through spacetime in the spatial dimensions and it moves at 299,792,458 m/s.  \n  \nSo to get back to your question, no as long as a meter is still a meter and a second is still a second then the speed can't be anything else.  It's just a conversion factor between two things that although they seem independent from our everyday perspective, are actually not.

Now, suppose you were to draw several perfect squares around the grid of various sizes. If someone counted the number of grid-lengths along each side of any square, they would of course find that the ratios of the sides was always 1.

Of course, the sides are related by the ratio 1, because they're squares!\n\nBut now suppose that you had originally drawn the grid so that the lines were separated by 1cm in the horizontal, but by 2.37cm in the vertical.

Would someone mind explaining these in a little more detail?", "id": "d5l2e3p"}, {"comment": "You might remember from high school chemistry that electrons can only exist at certain discrete energy levels around an atom corresponding to the orbitals, and that no two electrons can be at the same energy level and spin. Well when we stick multiple atoms together to form a solid, these energy levels shift a little bit so that no two will directly overlap in energy, but can still hold just as many electrons. When a ton of atoms are put together all of these energy levels are spread out into a discrete range, and we call that range a band. Thus you can think of a band as a range of energy that electrons in that solid are allowed to have.\n\nAs you might imagine, there are many different band configurations found in different materials. It's these band configurations that govern the electrical properties of the material.\n\nOne way of envisioning band structures is by thinking of clear boxes that may or may not contain water. The band structure will look like a stack of boxes separated by space in between. The bottom boxes are all filled with water and the top boxes are all mostly empty (because the electrons preferably fill the lowest energy levels first). Where it gets interesting is at the boundary.\n\nMaterials can be generally categorized into 3 groups electrically: conductor, insulator, and semiconductor. Conductor band structures have their top-most band half filled; their hightst-filled box is half water and half air. Thus it's really easy to slosh water from the left of the box to the right (analogous to conducting electrons along a metal wire for instance).\n\nInsulators have their highest-filled box completely full, so there's no air, only water. It's therefore impossible to slosh water from left to right, those electrons have nowhere to go. Thus materials like this are terrible at conducting electricity and we call them insulators.\n\nSemiconductors, like insulators, have their highest-filled box completely full as well. The difference however is that the next empty box above it isn't very far away. In fact with a little bit of effort, we can splash some water into the next higher box, and all of a sudden we can move that splash from left to right again (conducting electrons) in that next box up. The box full of water below is called the valence band because it is made up of all the valence electrons from the atoms. The empty box above is known as the conduction band because there's enough room up there (energetically) for electrons to conduct back and forth.\n\nInterestingly, if you imagine we splashed some water into the conduction band, we actually left a little air in the valence band as well (where that water used to be). These bubbles left behind can also conduct from right to left and create a meaningful current as well. In semiconductors these bubbles are known as holes.\n\nNow an integral part of semiconductor physics is the concept of doping. If you can replace some of the atoms in your material with an atom that normally has extra electrons, it can (if the energy is right) donate that electron to the conduction band to allow a current to pass. Think of an eye dropper sitting just below the bottom of the conduction box that squirts water up a few centimeters. Doesn't take much energy to squirt up that much and now you have some electrons you can use for conducting! This is known as n-type doping.\n\nSimilarly you can put an eye dropper just above your valence band and take up a little bit of water into it, leaving some bubbles (holes) in your valence band. These can also be used for conducting! This is known as p-type doping.\n\nAll of semiconductor physics revolves around engineering these concepts to create useful things. By combining different semiconducting materials, with different band levels, with different doping regions, with some insulators and conductors, we can create all sorts of devices such as solar cells (photovoltaics), LEDs, MOSFETs, lasers, etc. Semiconductors are the real stars of the electrical devices world because of how varied and manipulable their properties are.", "id": "d5l593c"}, {"comment": "Thanks, that was perfectly detailed for me to understand!

Essentially, the conduction band is the energy level of the electrons floating by in the n-type, while the valence band is the energy level of the electrons attached to him or that he has in his hand. It's also where the holes are in the p-type. The gate voltage actually moves these energy levels relative to each other, which is what allows the device to work.", "id": "d5l34zz"}, {"comment": "In semiconductors of all types, one obtains an increase in the number of charge carriers with an increase in the temperature due to the increased thermal activation. Since conductivity is proportional to the product of the number of charge carriers per unit volume, and the velocity of charge carries, there is an increase in the conductivity. \n\nWhen atoms come together to form a solid, their valence electrons interact with each other due to electrostatic forces. The HEISENBERG\u2019S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE constrains the electrons to a small volume, raising their energy, and thus causing PROMOTION. However, due to the PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE, the number of electrons that have the same energy level is limited. \n\nAs a result of these effects, the valence electrons of atoms form wide ELECTRON ENERGY BANDS when they form a solid. The bands are separated by gaps, where electrons cannot exist. The electrons of isolated atoms occupy only specific orbitals or energy levels, and thus create energy gaps between the energy levels. \n\nThe Paul Exclusion Principle states that only two electrons can occupy the same level, and that these two electrons must be of opposite magnetic spin. Thus, with its magnitude of levels, a band may contain twice as many electrons as there are atoms. The lower energy levels of the energy band fill first. \n\nThe uppermost level at 0 deg K is called the FERMI ENERGY.
