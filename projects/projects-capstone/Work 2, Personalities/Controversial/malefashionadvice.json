Good Choice if I may say so.  Looks romantic, quiet, a nice place to celebrate but not breaking the bank and helps a lot.  Based on her dress, if it is more formal or more casual you have some options.  I'd probably stay away from that particular outfit.  Nothing wrong with it and you won't look too nerdy but its more casual than I'd go for nice restaurant like that.  Shorts in general, for example, will be more casual than pants.  And cargo shorts are more casual than flat fronts.\nSince you're on a slight time crunch I'll give you my go to for this kind of setting: I'd do a dark denim jean with a button up shirt, the one in your picture would be fine as long as it doesn't clash with the jeans, a plain white is always a good backup and will look very nice.  Then if you want to wear the sneakers that should be fine but personally I'd go with something more like a loafer or dark leather shoe.  It's more formal, yes, but sometimes having that more classic look conveys a deeper message that you're taking things more seriously.  Further, it would look nicer for a more formal setting since the sneakers will make the outfit more casual.  Having said that they will work fine and can always be a bit of your personal style thrown in so I would never rule them out.  A lot of people are wearing nice sneakers in formal settings now so if you really like them try them on, if you feel they look good, then go for it!  Make sure you have a nice leather belt to go with it.  The watch is very nice, keep it.

Basically Scottish Formal Wear.\nSarongs and Wraps: Very comfortable except if you have sensitive skin (the \"asymmetrical\" way you have to tie it around yourself ends up aggravating the areas where there is to much overlap (like the knot or pin area, or area where it is \"tucked\") so they will get extremely annoying after awhile (but no where near as bad as wool garments and kilts >.>)).\nMumus, Wizard/monk robes, and Sundresses type clothes (tunics, Arabian wear, women's fit dresses, etc): Very Comfortable but a lot of these tend to be heavy to extremely heavy (a monk's tunic/robes can weigh around 75 lbs... equally distributed but hanging ultimately on your shoulders to neck area BONUS: functions as heavily weighted clothing and will greatly increase your passive strength, speed and agility when not wearing them if you wear them daily). These are the most \"fun\" to wear and it is easy to feel and look very confident in them, they are pretty basic and limited unless you adorn them with embroidery/fringes/fancy wizard schwag, but the sundress and tunics can be as vibrant and floral as sarongs and wraps worn by various cultures(men/males) in the pacific islands and outlying communities. Most of these clothes are meant for INTENSE winter (robes and tunics) or very hot dry but breezy climate (tunics and Arabian wear, sundresses).\n\nJust skirts: the Jersey skirts (they look like knee length sweat pants but are a skit and extremely comfortable, commonly available in Asian countries and somewhat available in school supply clothing stores in the \"cheer leader\" and \"gym\" clothes type sections) which are basically workout/lounging style skirts are quite nice and look very good on guys.\n\nGenerally speaking skirts are for practical use and \"air flow\" to the loins, but in winter climates long skirts/dresses are usually worn over other clothes to keep your insulating clothes DRY as skirts brush aside snow and debris extremely well and protect your boots and pants from dampness and getting dirty.\n\nConfidence: You must make sure the skirt actually looks good on YOU, a burly lumberjack looking man, while capable of pulling off a sunflower strapy sundress, would look significantly better if the dress had thick straps and a deep V neck to show off his manly chest hair and ripped chest and torso, backless would look good depending on how thick the forest pelt of backhair is (the more hair the better backless would look appropriate for his body type/style). Meanwhile those with androgenyous frames and looks look good in most styles but tend to look \"sharper\" with monotone or monochromatic or neutral colors instead of colorful stuff. For going for FUN looks that put a smile and yours and others face and have sparkly radiance, consider tie-dyed stuff, or just dress eclectically like fashionable trend making hippies used to(things like where half of your bottom half clothes are a dress and the other side pants, its surprisingly comfortable by the way especially in the crotch shockingly lol). \n\nYukata: The Traditional Japanese informal to formal wear \n\nNot mentioned: Tribal wear (you need to be a member of said tribe to pull off their looks generally, or at least a 1/2-1/16th blood with STRONG ethnic physical genetic traits to your former tribe), Ainu, etc. (these are tribe/culture/village exclusive wear and always looks awful on someone without that genealogies specific body styles)\n\nTHE THIRD OPTIONS: Make your own clothes and be a trend setter or trailblazer, you don't have to wear skirts/robes or pants, invent something NEW! Go nudist.\n\nA word of Advice: Skirts and Dresses look HORRIBLE on all overweight men unless you carry your weight in a really special way that you can pull off that \"chubby islander in a sarong/grass skirt\" type look(where most of your fat is NOT in your belly), and look GOOD on really fit/ripped/cut men, Males have very few body types compared to women and only a few of them look good in most clothes (most current modern mens clothes hide these areas when you don't look good and give you a false appearance/hide your unhealthy habits(flaws)), clothes like skirts/sideless skirts that show off the legs, hips, oblique, knees, calves, etc, you need GOOD looking FIT or shapely legs to pull off (remember most males have only a few styles of leg musculature), weightlifters for instance won't look good in skirts due to thigh disproportions from deadlifts and excessive squats, gymnasts on the other hand look amazing in all kinds of clothes, and things like skirts or more fashionable unique wear really highlights these good stable looks their body shows off.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention Full Ball Gowns and similar extravagant multilayered clothes: Umm, generally these get a lot of laughs on guys and you need a VERY manly body type (see that stereotypical hairy fit AF Russian lumberjack vibe) to look good in, Scotts tend to pull these off on holloween easily and get gasps of jealousy from women at parties interestingly (at least in my observation, red hair and seeping manliness from your pores seems to be necessary), most \"hard\" ethnicities looks striking in \"Disney Princess\" style extravagant gowns. Ultimately these are very time consuming to put on (usually need a second person to \"dress\" you), extremely impractical outside of...well a Ball/Halloween party. Looks surprisingly good on the right male body type (a few of the types), about as common as say the \"wrong\" female body type (female body types ball gowns look horrible on), so we are looking at 10-15% of biological males perhaps? The converse is that most women body types look AMAZING in male clothes and pull them off quite well. The general reveal from this is that: most men don't have body types (or don't work their body) that look good in many clothes, so males are generally defaulted to either local functional wear or the generic modern male fashion choices that cover over most of these undesirable traits and give an over all \"sharp\" or \"business\"(or businesscasual/bussinessparty) look. \n\nGenerally speaking find out your cultural/genetic heritage and try wearing your culture's/tribe's/clan's traditional wear and formal wear you will be shocked how often people find it eerily comfortable and somehow nostalgic (like they were \"meant\" to wear those clothes), and generally speaking again it looks GOOD on them, real good!\n\nTL;DR: Confidence and a good eye for what looks good on YOU and your body type matter most when selecting clothing. Clothes are first practicality/functionality and second ART (and fashion), so consider the weather where you are, your body type, how fit you are, when choosing what kind of skirt/kilt/wrap/robe you want to wear, COMFORT = King (the more comfortable you are in your clothes the more you radiate confidence in yourself, looks, etc, as its easily read on your face/body), Life Goals: Heavy Robes and weighted clothing are great for constant all day work outs, tend to be modest but are freely style-able to your personality or functionality needs, Light clothes are great for hot breezy sun beaten weather and deserts and protecting your skin, Trend Setting: Make your own clothes and invent new things, get an eye for what looks good on you.

I was looking at Harry Styles and how his fashion evolved over time. When he was younger he didnt have tattoos and he used to wear fancier stuff. Now he has tattoos, and he wears much more simple clothes. So I am guessing that tattoos automatically provide the edginess, which is why he can get away with simpler clothes. \n\ni am a newbie, but I thought the combination of clothes/tattoos have to be taken together. If you have tattoos you can get away with simple clothes, yet have a edgy look. if you dont have tattoos, you have to compensate by having over the top clothing. \n\nIts like how very hot girls/guys look best with simple clothes. But girls/guys who are not in their best shape/features need to put more effort into choosing clothes, accessorizing etc.\n\nI have already looked into YSL. Thanks for pointing out the other ones.

What's generally regarded as fashionable or gross?\n\nTo start with some of your questions - a lot of things look good, it just depends on your style - or what others have said, \"what speaks to you\". As far as trends I wouldn't follow them too hard or else you will find yourself with a lot of unusable clothes in years to come. Look at the trends, see what you think fits your style/will last. I don't like following disposable trends and wasting money. I want to invest in pieces that will generally look good for years (may need alternation depending on taste). \n\nI guess you could say there are some \"do not wear\" things in men's fashion - a'la Jnco jeans, fedora + tshirt, etc. It is generally easy to spot these kind of trends. \n\nSince you say you have an hourglass figure, if you are wanting to present more as male I would definitely recommend staying away from \"skinny jeans\" - unless you want to have a more feminine but still masculine silhouette. As others have said, slim/tapered cut is probably good as it sits in the middle of skinny jeans and boot/straight cut. I don't really know how you want to present yourself, what is \"too much\" in one direction - you will have to find that happy medium.\n\nOthers have said some good advice like building a relationship with a tailor. \n\nAs far as men's sizing. Jeans goes by inches - but suffers from the same vanity sizing women's jeans have (maybe not as much though). My waist measures 30 but I can fit into 28's depending on the brand/cut. \n\n[A size 12/14 translates to a 36/38\" chest](http://www.robe-experts.com/size-conversion). I am not sure how much you would have to add because of breasts, but you said it is largely taken care of by binders. Sizes like S, M, and L do not mean all that much as every brand has its own base size they start with depending on their target customer. If you are ordering online I generally check the fit guide on the brands website to see how it fits compared to other brands.

Arm length for long sleeve is trickier as Maker A does it from shoulder edge to wrist and Maker B does it from middle of back to wrist.  So....refer to fitment guides and know this has some flex...I'd know your shoulder to wrist and middle of back to wrist to cover most bases.\n\nMost modern pants fit at wear you wear them vice natural waist and length is pretty easy to nail down.

What's trendy? What's generally regarded as fashionable or gross?\n\nTo start with some of your questions - a lot of things look good, it just depends on your style - or what others have said, \"what speaks to you\". As far as trends I wouldn't follow them too hard or else you will find yourself with a lot of unusable clothes in years to come. Look at the trends, see what you think fits your style/will last. I don't like following disposable trends and wasting money. I want to invest in pieces that will generally look good for years (may need alternation depending on taste). \n\nI guess you could say there are some \"do not wear\" things in men's fashion - a'la Jnco jeans, fedora + tshirt, etc. It is generally easy to spot these kind of trends. \n\nSince you say you have an hourglass figure, if you are wanting to present more as male I would definitely recommend staying away from \"skinny jeans\" - unless you want to have a more feminine but still masculine silhouette. As others have said, slim/tapered cut is probably good as it sits in the middle of skinny jeans and boot/straight cut. I don't really know how you want to present yourself, what is \"too much\" in one direction - you will have to find that happy medium.\n\nOthers have said some good advice like building a relationship with a tailor. \n\nAs far as men's sizing. Jeans goes by inches - but suffers from the same vanity sizing women's jeans have (maybe not as much though). My waist measures 30 but I can fit into 28's depending on the brand/cut. \n\n[A size 12/14 translates to a 36/38\" chest](http://www.robe-experts.com/size-conversion). I am not sure how much you would have to add because of breasts, but you said it is largely taken care of by binders. Sizes like S, M, and L do not mean all that much as every brand has its own base size they start with depending on their target customer.

You'll need to measure as you would normally present (some trans chest wrap, so if that's your normal presentation, chest wrap, then measure).  Arm length for long sleeve is trickier as Maker A does it from shoulder edge to wrist and Maker B does it from middle of back to wrist.  So....refer to fitment guides and know this has some flex...I'd know your shoulder to wrist and middle of back to wrist to cover most bases.\n\nMost modern pants fit at wear you wear them vice natural waist and length is pretty easy to nail down.  Remember tailoring the inseam length is a thing if you are between sizes, so learn to sew or mentally add $10 to the price if not perfect.  Also remember that slim fit is the current style and has to do with the thigh and/or calf billowiness and does not mean spandex ass fitment.

Keep Henley's one solid color each.\n\n2. 3-4 polos or short sleeve (casual) button downs: I tend to think the simpler the better for polos but if you want stripes or color blocks or a huge logo across your chest then go ahead. Casual button downs are nice because you'll look more put together without looking like a fuckhead who's trying too hard.\n\n3. 1-3 button downs: You'll occasionally have an event you might want to go to where you'll want something a little more formal. Remember you're in college so it doesn't have to be a nice fitted dress shirt, and an Oxford or a Gingham semi-casual button down will wok too. Just don't show up in short sleeves.\n\n4. Pair of dark jeans: I have a nice $20 pair I got on sale at GAP. You don't have to go crazy here.\n\n5. Pair of light pants/chinos: Easy to match any shirts and shoes with. I have a pair of Levi's 511's (I think).\n\n6. 1-2 pairs of shorts: obviously this depends largely based on where you live, but one light color pair is the easiest to match clothes with. I'd say avoid cargo pants (I do) but since this is a \"college compact guide\" then you do you bro. Shorts are mostly about comfort anyway and if that's your only fashion faux pas it's not the end of the world tbh.\n\n7. Pair of sneakers: Again this is the college compact guide so make sure to have a versatile sneaker like vans\n\n8. Pair of boat shoes or brown/tan street shoe: MFA will kill me on this one but it's extremely versatile and at least here in the south it's perfectly acceptable to brown boaters with chinos and a button down to an event that isn't formal, but you don't want to be underdressed for.\n\n9. Jacket: don't be the college guy who just wears a hoodie when it gets cold. I'm not going to tell you what kind of jacket you should buy because that depends a lot on where you live but if you want to stand out get something you find interesting, and comfortable. It's a jacket and you're in college so there are way too many ways you could go with this, just keep in mind the rest of your wardrobe.\n\n10. Sweater: This has become my winter bread and butter since if you pick a few nice sweaters you can roll out of bed throw on a shit tee and a nice sweater along with a pair of pants and suddenly you genuinely look good. I've literally been complimented on how good I looked one day in the dining hall at my university because I threw a sweater with a collar on over a free Uni tee with light pants and a good beanie to hide my gross greasy hair. I thought they were kidding at first but no they legit thought I had put some real thought into that outfit. The number of sweaters you should own obviously depends on the climate at your University but get something versatile enough to be worn at a nice restaurant while casual enough to put on for the walk to the dining hall.\n\n11. Underwear: Do yourself a favor and start buying boxer briefs. Your future gf will thank you.\n\n12. Belt: Don't show off those new boxer briefs in public.\n\nOh but that sounds like it's gonna cost a fortune... Don't pay a fortune. Go to TJ Maxx, and Marshall's and you'd be surprised the stuff you can actually find there. Find a nearby outlet mall, and pay attention to sales and coupons. You don't have to buy everything all at once keep an eye out for the stuff you want and have an idea of how much you'd be willing to pay for certain pieces of clothing. The best way to build a wardrobe of clothes you like is to take an interest in what you wear and actually go looking for clothes. Prioritize what you're looking for. I'd say pants are shirts are the most important and at TJ Maxx or Marshall's you can get 3 casual shirts (sometime even casual button downs) for $30-40. That's almost half a week of clothes throw in a $20-30 pair of pants and you're under $100 for most of the clothes you'll be wearing in a week. Slowly but surely you'll have plenty of options if good clothes.\n\nBonus: I have one grey beanie I wear when it's cold to cover my ears in the wind. Don't be afraid to be the beanie guy occasionally because if you're anything like me sometimes you just don't want to wrestle with your hair in the morning.\n\nBonus: Buy a nice watch, a tie, and dress shoes. Make sure the watch is versatile enough to be worn every day because you're in college and don't want a whole collection of watches but I'm pretty in love with my Movado series 800 Chrono. Granted that was a gift but you can get a good deal on a fossil watch that would fit the bill and you'd be surprised how often you'll get compliments on your watch. Just the other day some girl started chatting me up at Chick-fil-A because she liked my watch and I had a nice lunch with her instead of eating alone like I was planning to. It can be a decent conversation starter and I haven't even mentioned how convenient it is to actually wear a watch and only have to glance at your wrist to tell the time. Just avoid digital watches and for the most part that includes smart watches regardless of how much you may want to nerd out with your moto 360 like me. All that being said if you genuinely love how your smart watch looks then just wear it, you'll feel more comfortable and confident that way (because you'll like how you look) and ultimately that's what fashion advice is for in the first place.\n\nOne last Bonus: A sport coat/blazer. I'm still looking for a nice sport coat that's in my budget but much like the other jackets and sweaters it should be something that's versatile and easy to throw on if you need to look a bit more formal. This is college and I live in the US so it's formal enough for most nonfrat occasions. Although I should point out that I'm yet to really find any I like on a college budget so it's a bonus if I've ever seen one."], [3, "what nikes are those?"], [7, "you'll still be that guy that looks like a basic ass fuccboi "], [1, "As a college student, this wardrobe would totally make you that guy.\n\nEdit: Wow, this is a weird subreddit..."], [3, "Yeah I read the whole list and I'm convinced this is how to be \"That Guy\".

Keep Henley's one solid color each.\n\n2. 3-4 polos or short sleeve (casual) button downs: I tend to think the simpler the better for polos but if you want stripes or color blocks or a huge logo across your chest then go ahead. Casual button downs are nice because you'll look more put together without looking like a fuckhead who's trying too hard.\n\n3. 1-3 button downs: You'll occasionally have an event you might want to go to where you'll want something a little more formal. Remember you're in college so it doesn't have to be a nice fitted dress shirt, and an Oxford or a Gingham semi-casual button down will wok too. Just don't show up in short sleeves.\n\n4. Pair of dark jeans: I have a nice $20 pair I got on sale at GAP. You don't have to go crazy here.\n\n5. Pair of light pants/chinos: Easy to match any shirts and shoes with. I have a pair of Levi's 511's (I think).\n\n6. 1-2 pairs of shorts: obviously this depends largely based on where you live, but one light color pair is the easiest to match clothes with. I'd say avoid cargo pants (I do) but since this is a \"college compact guide\" then you do you bro. Shorts are mostly about comfort anyway and if that's your only fashion faux pas it's not the end of the world tbh.\n\n7. Pair of sneakers: Again this is the college compact guide so make sure to have a versatile sneaker like vans\n\n8. Pair of boat shoes or brown/tan street shoe: MFA will kill me on this one but it's extremely versatile and at least here in the south it's perfectly acceptable to brown boaters with chinos and a button down to an event that isn't formal, but you don't want to be underdressed for.\n\n9. Jacket: don't be the college guy who just wears a hoodie when it gets cold. I'm not going to tell you what kind of jacket you should buy because that depends a lot on where you live but if you want to stand out get something you find interesting, and comfortable. It's a jacket and you're in college so there are way too many ways you could go with this, just keep in mind the rest of your wardrobe.\n\n10. Sweater: This has become my winter bread and butter since if you pick a few nice sweaters you can roll out of bed throw on a shit tee and a nice sweater along with a pair of pants and suddenly you genuinely look good. I've literally been complimented on how good I looked one day in the dining hall at my university because I threw a sweater with a collar on over a free Uni tee with light pants and a good beanie to hide my gross greasy hair. I thought they were kidding at first but no they legit thought I had put some real thought into that outfit. The number of sweaters you should own obviously depends on the climate at your University but get something versatile enough to be worn at a nice restaurant while casual enough to put on for the walk to the dining hall.\n\n11. Underwear: Do yourself a favor and start buying boxer briefs. Your future gf will thank you.\n\n12. Belt: Don't show off those new boxer briefs in public.\n\nOh but that sounds like it's gonna cost a fortune... Don't pay a fortune. Go to TJ Maxx, and Marshall's and you'd be surprised the stuff you can actually find there. Find a nearby outlet mall, and pay attention to sales and coupons. You don't have to buy everything all at once keep an eye out for the stuff you want and have an idea of how much you'd be willing to pay for certain pieces of clothing. The best way to build a wardrobe of clothes you like is to take an interest in what you wear and actually go looking for clothes. Prioritize what you're looking for. I'd say pants are shirts are the most important and at TJ Maxx or Marshall's you can get 3 casual shirts (sometime even casual button downs) for $30-40. That's almost half a week of clothes throw in a $20-30 pair of pants and you're under $100 for most of the clothes you'll be wearing in a week. Slowly but surely you'll have plenty of options if good clothes.\n\nBonus: I have one grey beanie I wear when it's cold to cover my ears in the wind. Don't be afraid to be the beanie guy occasionally because if you're anything like me sometimes you just don't want to wrestle with your hair in the morning.\n\nBonus: Buy a nice watch, a tie, and dress shoes. Make sure the watch is versatile enough to be worn every day because you're in college and don't want a whole collection of watches but I'm pretty in love with my Movado series 800 Chrono. Granted that was a gift but you can get a good deal on a fossil watch that would fit the bill and you'd be surprised how often you'll get compliments on your watch. Just the other day some girl started chatting me up at Chick-fil-A because she liked my watch and I had a nice lunch with her instead of eating alone like I was planning to. It can be a decent conversation starter and I haven't even mentioned how convenient it is to actually wear a watch and only have to glance at your wrist to tell the time. Just avoid digital watches and for the most part that includes smart watches regardless of how much you may want to nerd out with your moto 360 like me. All that being said if you genuinely love how your smart watch looks then just wear it, you'll feel more comfortable and confident that way (because you'll like how you look) and ultimately that's what fashion advice is for in the first place.\n\nOne last Bonus: A sport coat/blazer. I'm still looking for a nice sport coat that's in my budget but much like the other jackets and sweaters it should be something that's versatile and easy to throw on if you need to look a bit more formal. This is college and I live in the US so it's formal enough for most nonfrat occasions. Although I should point out that I'm yet to really find any I like on a college budget so it's a bonus if I've ever seen one.", "id": "d7ds4tg"}, {"comment": "This is a really, really bad guide on like every level.\n\nYou should post a fit.", "id": "d7ds6e0"}], [{"comment": "what nikes are those?", "id": "d7egpbr"}, {"comment": "Reflective Flyknit FSB Chukkas", "id": "d7egqrv"}], [{"comment": "you'll still be that guy that looks like a basic ass fuccboi ", "id": "d7dvzex"}, {"comment": "post a fit", "id": "d7dw005"}], [{"comment": "As a college student, this wardrobe would totally make you that guy.\n\nEdit: Wow, this is a weird subreddit...", "id": "d7dx8vl"}, {"comment": "post a fit", "id": "d7dxd8l"}], [{"comment": "Yeah I read the whole list and I'm convinced this is how to be \"That Guy\".

He's not gonna get anywhere if he doesn't break out of this mindset and do something to combine the two, it's just where we are as a society honestly, male and female fashion are merging more and more nowadays. Get out of your comfort zone and put some of the dudes in those tighter silhouettes and see what you can do with it.

Maybe you aren't.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being price conscious.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with not liking Chelsea boots.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with going to Kohls.\n\n\nThere is something wrong with implying you don't fit because **other** people don't fit your idea of style. Or implying their expense is universally ridiculous, nevermind their circumstance, preference or anything else.\n\nThe most basic lesson you should take away from here: fit is everything. Great looks start with fitting well. Even basic \"jeans and a t shirt\" have certain parameters that make certain fits better than other.\n\nRetailers that are driven by the average consumer, the mass public, have clothes that reflect the demands. They are fit to a more universal standard, for much more mass production. Box cuts, baggy shoulders/thighs, etc, to be repurchased regularly. They fit 4-5 body types in a general range. The reason I address that is because retailers who *do* fit their clothes more appropriately, tend to charge more. Be it actual production costs or they just know the people who care to make their clothes fit properly will spend more, whatever; it happens. $80 isn't a purchase of extravagance, it's about the norm. I understand why it seems that way, especially if fashion isn't a primary hobby but look at it another way: You can spend $80 on a shirt that will last a reasonable amount of time, will probably require no alterations, but if it does they will be minimum.. Or you could spend $30, have it altered much more significantly, never have it \"quite\" right, since you've probably gone outside the scope of how the fabric was cut and have it in a lesser quality material. Nevermind the lost time/cost spent actually getting the clothes altered. \n\nThat is a very broad generalization and there are very many notable exceptions. Expensive clothes do not mean better, cheap does not mean worse. However, it's a bad idea to rule out something because of gut reaction, rather than considering the \"why's\" behind it.\n\nFor the actual fashion, that is extremely personal preference.\n\nI agree with you, I like the first guy, the second guy is not my thing... But that doesn't mean he's wearing anything ridiculous and that doesn't mean people are saying if you aren't wearing that, you're not stylish. What gets lost when someone stumbles in here is that it is not the idea of \"do this, don't do that\", but rather piecing together a better look for your needs, from looks that catch your eye, while filtering out things that aren't your preference, both in overall looks and specifics.", "id": "d9zkhl5"}, {"comment": "> I feel like a douche.\n\nHey, don't.

They're all different cuts and wildly different fabrics but some of them are worth nowhere near the 200ish they retailed for while the one I liked I would have paid 400 for easily.\n\nThe amount of variables even between a single brand in one season is huge and for many large brands they produce 5+ different types of tees usually in many different fabrics/cuts. There was a KKA tee that I really enjoyed once except the way it was dyed meant that over time it would intentionally reveal a different shade underneath which would be fine except the dye came off on things pretty easily.

How to dress is not a set of rules, and includes nuance; there's what is in right now, what looks 'technically' good, what was 'in' in the past, what seems normal to the micro communities you're a part of (after moving back to my hometown after living in a big city, I had to change up my wardrobe because in my significantly smaller city, certain pieces I had were weird in my hometown while almost expected in the community I was living in previously). What fashion is, is constantly changing, so while we try our best to put things simply, often there's nuance. So if I say to you (like what just happened) here's a type of shirt that looks good, and you disagree, then the 'simpler' rules just broke down. So here, instead of saying, \"hey, you want to look good, here's this, no questions\", and you leave feeling like you don't know how to dress; we try to say, \"well, if you like so-and-so, and wear these colors, you could probably work that into your wardrobe\". Which might be somewhat of a nuanced pain in the rear, but you're gonna confuse or frustrate someone on either side.\n\nSo: Honestly the best way not to look like a fool in public is to dress like the people around you dress, your friends, coworkers, family. If you think someone looks good, say, \"hey, where'd you get those pants?\" If they're out of your price range, look around a little and find something similar. You don't need your own style if you don't want it. Tons of people go through each day not thinking one thing about what they're wearing, and so it's not inherently \"bad\" if all you're doing is trying to fit in and don't want fashion to be your life. We are trying to help people dress better in general, but the easiest/best-ish thing to do is just copy people in the culture you exist in because they're who matter (heck, that's what most people here do, their community just happens to exist within fashion trends).", "id": "cz9kep0"}], [{"comment": "Sounds like you need to read Dappered.com", "id": "cz9facm"}], [{"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cz9efxz"}, {"comment": "Did you happen to read the entirety of his post at all?

I had been reading about washing leather jackets to soften them and remove gloss, and had heard that drying them will result in 1-2 sizes of shrinkage, so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nIt turned out great in my opinion. The grain pattern is crazy pronounced now, and it looks a lot more like the [hammered lamb](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e0/07/69/e00769594dfc167f1fd5b6f3d2a22528.jpg) with the bent zippers and everything. I realize that it is more fucked up and won't be to everyone's taste but Rick leathers aren't supposed to be perfect and even.\n\n----\n\nFor those that want to give it a shot, here's a cheap and simple way to shrink your leather jacket 1-2 sizes and get a better fit if you lost weight or have a jacket that just doesn't fit right.\n\n# How to shrink your leather jacket\n\n1. Turn inside out, fasten all zippers and unfasten all buttons\n\n2. Soak thoroughly in a bucket or tub of hot water, or run through the washing machine on gentle\n\n3. Remove from wash and give a few tugs to the leather around the zippers (to lessen waviness) and anything else you want to shrink less\n\n4. Add to dryer with a few towels, dry on medium - high for 45-90 minutes depending on how much shrinkage you want (results pictured are from 70 minutes on high)\n\n5. Periodically give it a check to make sure it isn\u2019t shrinking too much and to tug on the zippers, sleeves, etc., always zipping back up and turning inside out after\n\n6. Remove from dryer and let air dry the rest of the way, either on a hanger, dress form, or newspapers on the floor\n\n7. Apply leather conditioner\n\n# Caveats\n\n**The jacket will shrink proportionately everywhere**. It won't work if just the body is too big but fits everywhere else as you will lose a decent amount of length in the sleeves (not a problem on Rick jackets with the comically long sleeves). You can get some length back especially with lamb and lighter leathers by pulling when it is still wet.\n\n**Lamb will shrink the most** and also stretch back the most. Calf might not shrink so dramatically. You can wear it when it's still wet to make it conform to your body more but I felt like that was just making the elbows and back stretch excessively so I stopped. Air drying on a hanger will give more drape.\n\n**The lining will not shrink at all** so it can end up a little bit bunchy especially in the sleeves. This can be tailored pretty easily. Worst case is it sticks out of the sleeves or back but mine didn't end up too bad. On the other hand, if it has any wool (some Intarsias and Geos, older Bauhaus jackets, all Rick women's leathers) then I wouldn't recommend this at all as the wool might shrink way more than the leather.\n\n**Don't do this if you can't handle some wabi sabi**. The grain might be uneven, your zippers will be wavy, collar or lapels can end up wonky. On mine the already pronounced grain pattern went completely out of control, which I personally love. Worst case is the color and patina end up splotchy but luckily I had almost no color change. I feel like pulling around the zippers when it was wet really helped prevent them from getting too wavy.\n\n**The character of the leather can change quite a bit**. Generally the wash will make it more matte and softer, the dryer can make it stiffer, and conditioning will soften it back up. Heavily processed leathers like some from Julius and Boris can end up getting destroyed so be careful. I've only heard success stories from Rick leathers though, even the blistered lamb.\n\n**Conditioning at the end is very important** as the leather will be very dry. I used Lexol neatsfoot non-darkening conditioner. Pecard's, Obenauf's, Huberd, and Saphir are the other good brands but some contain wax and/or petroleum ingredients which some people don't like. I went with the Lexol because it was strictly a conditioner and wouldn't darken the color.\n\n# Further reading\n\nhttp://helloblackbird.blogspot.com/2009/07/washing-your-leather-jacket-by-peter.html\nhttp://www.stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showthread.php?11700-Machine-washing-and-drying-a-leather-jacket\nhttp://www.stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showthread.php?12109-I-WASHED-MY-CCP-FENCING-LEATHER-DO-NOT-TRY-THIS-AT-HOME-)\n\n# Summary\n\nGet it wet, put it in the dryer for about an hour, air dry for a day, condition.

There is a story about how he gave comedian Frank Calliendo a 125,000$ watch to wear on a date, and when Frank returned it he was told it was a fake watch that someone had sold to the jeweler in trump tower. To Frank, he didn't know the difference, he doesn't know one watch from another, so he believed that he was in fact wearing a 125,000$ watch.

Let's start with clarifying that he wasn't asking about yoga class, he was asking about butt-huggers to wear casually. For that I'd suggest leggings in an athletic-looking outfit, possibly with running shorts over them to add back a little modesty. In a non-athletic outfit, it might help to look for pants with some spandex content. Skinny jeans might fit the bill, but if they're tight and not stretchy enough then they'll flatten the ass rather than accentuate - so cut matters a lot. Honestly there's gonna be a lot of trial and error. Casual techwear pants from brands like Outlier or Proof NY are plenty stretchy synthetic stuff, and while they're thicker and looser than yoga pants, they're quite socially acceptable. Lower-end equivalents could be Lululemon pants or any slim-fitting golf pants. Basically, find slim, stretchy pants that fit really well, or wear athletic attire.\n\nAlso, if you're concerned about butt silhouette, don't carry your wallet in your back pocket!", "id": "d6u8bhp"}, {"comment": "nice response skating around the entire objection. you're entitled to your own outlook but imo this dude isn't obliged not to wear yoga pants because it \"might make someone feel uncomfortable\" or a breach of some imaginary universal etiquette. if i'm in yoga class doing yoga, i personally don't give a shit if the person in front of me wearing the eponymously named pant is a chick or a dude. and if i'm around town occupied with other things, i probably wouldn't even notice.

If you need some specifics on what to buy, here's what I recommend:\n\n1. T-shirts: Look for a 3-pack of Hanes Slim-fit white crewneck T-shirts at Target. White tees generally aren't worn on their own except in super-casual settings, so you'll be layering these underneath sweaters and button-down shirts mostly. If you need a more presentable T-shirt, Target also has nice-looking navy blue, maroon, and charcoal gray tees that can be worn on their own or used to add some contrast underneath other shirts. \n\n2. Button-ups: An oxford-cloth with a button-down collar will get you through all but the most formal situations. Buy one in white, and one color - pale blue, pale pink or yellow (these are better if your style leans toward the preppy side), striped, etc. [Uniqlo's](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-oxford-slim-fit-long-sleeve-shirt-172926.html#67~/men/casual-shirts/oxford/solid/~) are THE BEST - amazing quality, last a long time, machine washable, and slim fit - many are on sale for $19.90 right now. Wear these open over a colored T-shirt on a causal day, or over a white tee buttoned-up and tucked in on a more formal day.\n\n3. Heavier shirts: For fall/winter, you'll want something heavier, too. Try a flannel shirt in [red plaid](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-flannel-checked-long-sleeve-shirt-185559.html#16~/men/casual-shirts/flannel/checkered/~) or [medium to dark gray](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-flannel-long-sleeve-shirt-172940.html#08~/men/casual-shirts/flannel/solid/~). I'm linking Uniqlo, but this style is very popular and any H&M, Macy's, American Eagle, Forever 21, etc. will have 'em too.\n\n4. Sweaters: I'd start with two, one V-neck and one crewneck, in any of the following colors: black, white, camel, navy, maroon, gray, cobalt blue or red if you're feeling flashy. Look for a slim fit and a cotton/wool blend (less itchy than all wool, and generally machine washable). Looks great with jeans or khakis on a casual day, gray or black trousers for a formal event, interview, etc. Try different combos of shirts underneath them - play with contrasting colors of button-downs and T-shirts and see what you like. Try H&M or Target.\n\nThe above is a solid wardrobe of tops you can mix and match for a ton of different looks, that should take you from hanging around campus, to a fancy-ish holiday party with no problems. Just build up slowly, focus on fit, and have fun with it! You'll know what you like in no time."], [1, "Just start off with some super basic slim fit button ups and solid tees to get started and go from there. It's all going to be experimentation with what colors and cuts you like with your body shape and skin tone, but those are a good place to start. 4/5 times if you try to jump in with some super crazy piece, you will think that it looks awesome in the changing room then it will sit in your closet when you get home. Having decent slim fit pants and good shoes (like you said) is definitely a head start, but start super simple with your tops and develop a personal style from there. "], [1, "Quick advice: learn your sizes. Go to a store like j.crew and try on different sizes in stuff you like. Pay attention to cut: slim, straight, skinny.  \nBe careful too because it's kind of expected that if you are trying on a bunch of clothes at a store like j crew that you should at least buy one piece. If you aren't going to buy anything, do not be persuaded to do so and be very courteous to whoever is assisting you (put clothes back on hangers after you're done, don't leave a mess). Even let them know your intention straight away - you're there to see what fits well. They can even help with suggestions and such, who knows you may find something worth purchasing. \n"], [1, "Hey, definitely keep your cash my man. You don't have to pay anyone here for help - put it toward another shirt. But here's my advice on shirts:\n\nFirst, try to keep it simple starting out; don't re-invent the wheel until you know all about wheels. OCBDs, flannels, tee shirts, long sleeve henley, sweaters, maybe a cardigan or nice hoodie, and you've got a ton of options for jackets (that's my addiction). Most wardrobes are built around versatile pieces like this in solid colors or some basic patterns.\n\nH&M can help you out with lots of that stuff for sure. I like jcrew for sweaters personally, but there are lots of other places you can look too. Gap just released its new line in collaboration with some well-known designers - you might find some cool stuff there. I haven't bought anything from Uniqlo in a long time, but lots of people like their stuff. Just look for well-fitting stuff that's in nice colors, and don't be afraid to shop around...what other stores are in your area/what area are you from?\n\nFor versatile colors, I love maroon, olive, all kinds of blues, and grey. But what will go best with your skin tone? You can look this up, for example, here's an article discussing color-matching with Indian skin tones: [skin tones](http://m.timesofindia.com/life-style/fashion/style-guide/The-best-colours-for-Indian-skin-tones/articleshow/46988920.cms). Feel free to do more research, as that's like the first one I pulled up.\n\nFor your jacket: you have tons of options...bomber jacket, pea coat, top coat, field jacket, I own a filson mile marker jacket that I love. I would perhaps invest a little extra here to get a piece you really love since you'll wear it often. Also get a versatile color like olive, navy, grey. \n\nSecond, buy your stuff. Then, don't remove the tags. Snap some pics, blur out your face, and post them here.

If you need some specifics on what to buy, here's what I recommend:\n\n1. T-shirts: Look for a 3-pack of Hanes Slim-fit white crewneck T-shirts at Target. White tees generally aren't worn on their own except in super-casual settings, so you'll be layering these underneath sweaters and button-down shirts mostly. If you need a more presentable T-shirt, Target also has nice-looking navy blue, maroon, and charcoal gray tees that can be worn on their own or used to add some contrast underneath other shirts. \n\n2. Button-ups: An oxford-cloth with a button-down collar will get you through all but the most formal situations. Buy one in white, and one color - pale blue, pale pink or yellow (these are better if your style leans toward the preppy side), striped, etc. [Uniqlo's](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-oxford-slim-fit-long-sleeve-shirt-172926.html#67~/men/casual-shirts/oxford/solid/~) are THE BEST - amazing quality, last a long time, machine washable, and slim fit - many are on sale for $19.90 right now. Wear these open over a colored T-shirt on a causal day, or over a white tee buttoned-up and tucked in on a more formal day.\n\n3. Heavier shirts: For fall/winter, you'll want something heavier, too. Try a flannel shirt in [red plaid](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-flannel-checked-long-sleeve-shirt-185559.html#16~/men/casual-shirts/flannel/checkered/~) or [medium to dark gray](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-flannel-long-sleeve-shirt-172940.html#08~/men/casual-shirts/flannel/solid/~). I'm linking Uniqlo, but this style is very popular and any H&M, Macy's, American Eagle, Forever 21, etc. will have 'em too.\n\n4. Sweaters: I'd start with two, one V-neck and one crewneck, in any of the following colors: black, white, camel, navy, maroon, gray, cobalt blue or red if you're feeling flashy. Look for a slim fit and a cotton/wool blend (less itchy than all wool, and generally machine washable). Looks great with jeans or khakis on a casual day, gray or black trousers for a formal event, interview, etc. Try different combos of shirts underneath them - play with contrasting colors of button-downs and T-shirts and see what you like. Try H&M or Target.\n\nThe above is a solid wardrobe of tops you can mix and match for a ton of different looks, that should take you from hanging around campus, to a fancy-ish holiday party with no problems. Just build up slowly, focus on fit, and have fun with it!

It's all going to be experimentation with what colors and cuts you like with your body shape and skin tone, but those are a good place to start. 4/5 times if you try to jump in with some super crazy piece, you will think that it looks awesome in the changing room then it will sit in your closet when you get home. Having decent slim fit pants and good shoes (like you said) is definitely a head start, but start super simple with your tops and develop a personal style from there. ", "id": "d8awp22"}], [{"comment": "Quick advice: learn your sizes. Go to a store like j.crew and try on different sizes in stuff you like. Pay attention to cut: slim, straight, skinny.  \nBe careful too because it's kind of expected that if you are trying on a bunch of clothes at a store like j crew that you should at least buy one piece. If you aren't going to buy anything, do not be persuaded to do so and be very courteous to whoever is assisting you (put clothes back on hangers after you're done, don't leave a mess). Even let them know your intention straight away - you're there to see what fits well. They can even help with suggestions and such, who knows you may find something worth purchasing. \n", "id": "d8axqve"}], [{"comment": "Hey, definitely keep your cash my man. You don't have to pay anyone here for help - put it toward another shirt. But here's my advice on shirts:\n\nFirst, try to keep it simple starting out; don't re-invent the wheel until you know all about wheels. OCBDs, flannels, tee shirts, long sleeve henley, sweaters, maybe a cardigan or nice hoodie, and you've got a ton of options for jackets (that's my addiction). Most wardrobes are built around versatile pieces like this in solid colors or some basic patterns.\n\nH&M can help you out with lots of that stuff for sure. I like jcrew for sweaters personally, but there are lots of other places you can look too. Gap just released its new line in collaboration with some well-known designers - you might find some cool stuff there. I haven't bought anything from Uniqlo in a long time, but lots of people like their stuff. Just look for well-fitting stuff that's in nice colors, and don't be afraid to shop around...what other stores are in your area/what area are you from?\n\nFor versatile colors, I love maroon, olive, all kinds of blues, and grey. But what will go best with your skin tone? You can look this up, for example, here's an article discussing color-matching with Indian skin tones: [skin tones](http://m.timesofindia.com/life-style/fashion/style-guide/The-best-colours-for-Indian-skin-tones/articleshow/46988920.cms). Feel free to do more research, as that's like the first one I pulled up.\n\nFor your jacket: you have tons of options...bomber jacket, pea coat, top coat, field jacket, I own a filson mile marker jacket that I love. I would perhaps invest a little extra here to get a piece you really love since you'll wear it often. Also get a versatile color like olive, navy, grey. \n\nSecond, buy your stuff. Then, don't remove the tags. Snap some pics, blur out your face, and post them here. We can give more concrete feedback when we can see the outfits, how the shirts go with your skin tone, and how they fit you. You can return stuff that's a no-go.\n\nGood luck!\n\n", "id": "d8ayqwl"}, {"comment": "thank u man. is this a good bomber would u say?

You're going to look great.\n\nNot sure how well-versed you are on dressing sharp, so first I'd say check out places like [Real Men Real Style](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRfQHc3U4fV1-i8Ry1HmtA?&ab_channel=RealMenRealStyle) to learn about men's style in general and get a feel for the \"rules\", like how a suit should fit, not buttoning the bottom button of your jacket, etc.\n\nIf you only watch one video, watch \"How a suit should fit\". Especially if you're going to buy a suit.\n\n**Alright, let's begin.**\n\nSo these days, you can pretty much wear anything to prom, so it's really nice to see someone wanting to look sharp. Go you! I remember seeing guys in shorts and t-shirts at my prom. Booo! Seriously! It's a really cool feeling to show up at your date's door looking like a million bucks, and at this age, there aren't many opportunities to dress like this. Enjoy it!\n\n**Suit or Tuxedo?**\n\nA tux is definitely more traditional for prom, and it would look kick *ass* if you got one that fits you really well.\n\nBut that said, there's absolutely [nothing wrong with a nice suit](http://cdn-mf1.heartyhosting.com/sites/mensfitness.com/files/d6/images-mf-209917-16737.jpg). I'm still positive you'd look kick ass. As for color, black would look slick at night, but charcoal grey would be a great investment if you're looking to buy instead of rent, since black suits are traditionally only seen at weddings, evening events (like prom), and funerals. Charcoal grey is *much* more versatile. You can wear it to anything and it looks great.\n\nSpeaking of buy, how's your budget leaning you? Because if you're leaning toward the tux, I'd say rent it. For one, you won't have many opportunities beyond this to wear a tux and it'll just take space and gather dust. Second, depending on your body and age, you might have more growing to do, and you'll grow out of the thing anyway.\n\nBUT, if you're leaning toward a suit, I'd say buy it. (Unless you're really young, like 14-15, and still growing a lot.) You'll get more use out of a suit. Specifically, charcoal grey. Like I said, you can wear a charcoal grey suit everywhere (like job interviews) and look really sharp and not out of place. I got one from JCPenney last year for ~$150 that fits really great off the rack. And if you live in a town with a tailor, even better. I can't imagine renting a tux for much less than $150.\n\nPS, if you're going to buy a suit off the rack and get it tailored, make sure the shoulders fit you properly when you buy it. Shoulders are the hardest/most expensive part to alter. But if you don't want to mess with a tailor or don't have one, don't sweat it. I'm sure you'll find something that fits great right off the rack.\n\n**Vest?**\n\nThat JCPenney suit I mentioned included a vest in that ~$150. I like vests, and you may want to get one if you get a suit, just to have it. BUT prom is probably going to be hot, and a vest is an extra layer to make you hot. So you may want to not do the vest at prom. Which is totally fine. But I'd say get it anyway if you can.\n\nAs for the tuxedo, it will probably come with a [cummerbund](http://www.mytuxedocatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/VV72L.jpg). No need to worry about a vest.\n\n**Matching Your Date**\n\nIf you get the tuxedo, I'm positive it will come with the tie/cummerbund, and you'll probably get to choose from a wide array of colors. Match her that way. Easy peasy!\n\nAs for matching your date if you do the suit, wear a white shirt and match by your tie. It's simple and subtle, but looks really nice. For example, if you wear a shirt the color of her dress, you'll almost look too matched, you know?\n\nCheck out a site like [Ties.com](http://www.ties.com/) and find one you like that matches her dress. Can't go wrong with matching a solid tie right to the color, but if you find one you like with some pattern, like plaid or polka dots or stripes, go for it.\n\nFor example, if [this](http://images.dreqm.net/images/dress/4307/Light-Sky-Blue-Chiffon-Party-Dress-of-Beaded-Halter-Neckline-and-Pleated-Skirt-in-Floor-Length-SD2503-01.jpg) is her dress, you could try a tie like [this](http://www.ties.com/peter-hayer-pale-blue-skinny-tie), but you could also go for some pattern like [this](http://www.ties.com/ties-com-aqua-huntington-polka-dots-skinny-tie-2).\n\nIn general, just pick something you like!\n\n**Tie or Bowtie?**\n\nNo matter what you pick, *learn to tie that sucker*. It's a valuable skill, and if you get hot, you can undo/loosen it, undo your top button, and [drape it around your neck](https://howtowasp.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bond_bowtie.jpg). Can't do that with a clip-on!\n\nNow, if you go for the tux, go bowtie for sure. A tux almost isn't even a tux without a bowtie. The tux will probably come with one, honestly. I'm positive it will. Especially if you rent.\n\nIf you get the suit, it's really up to you. If you do a normal tie, go with one labeled \"narrow\" or \"slim\". Unless you're a really big guy, then you could go with a normal sized one. It's all about proportion with your body.\n\nNow if you're comfortable with it, go for a bowtie. In one word, they're fun. They're different, they're more casual, they're a little fashion forward, and they draw a little more attention to you than just a tie would. I really like them made from cotton in [diamond tip](http://cdn.beautiesltd.com/images/homepage/standarddiamondchart.jpg) because, IMO, diamond tip is least likely to look \"clown-y\". As for color, the same matching tips mentioned above will apply.\n\nIf you go for a bowtie, you really have to own it. You can't be self conscious and think all night that you look [Bill Nye the Science Guy](http://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bill-nye.jpg) because it'll just make for a crummy night.\n\nNothing at all wrong with a tie if you aren't digging the bowtie. In fact, at a formal event like prom, a tie might be better. All depends on you and your style.\n\n**Final Tips and Conclusion**\n\nIf you buy a suit and don't plan to tailor everything, go for slim fit shirts. They're going to look 100x better than a \"regular\" fit, unless you're a really big guy.\n\nI really recommend browsing through a few of those videos on Real Men Real Style. He also has a website with tons of articles that almost always have an accompanying video. [Link.](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/) I know it seems like there's a ton of them (because there are, lol) but just browse through what seems relevant to you. The videos are usually pretty short but contain a lot of good info.\n\nI know all this probably seems like a lot, especially if you don't usually dress up very often, but don't let it worry you. It's really not as complicated as it sounds. Just relax and be yourself. Embrace the clothes, you know? Be comfortable in them. Don't put your suit on and feel like a guy in a suit. Feel like a guy that looks like a million bucks. Because you do.\n\n**If you need anything, don't hesitate to contact me.** I can even PM you my email if you want to ask more questions as you buy and stuff. I'd be glad to help.\n\nI hope this was helpful. I spent a solid hour writing it. Lol\n\nTake care!"], [2, "Try looking at cocktail attire dress code guides. It'll put you above the rest in terms of looking like you know what you're doing. If you were in a school fancy enough where everyone wore tuxedos then you'd likely already know and your parents would have sent you off to the family tailor.\n\nOn the subject of waistcoats, I wouldn't recommend them, but if you do, get it in the same material as the jacket and trousers.\n\nI know you also said that you were going to cover colour and fit, but I would recommend as close a fit as is comfortable and don't go overboard with flashiness when it comes to colour. Too many guys come off as trying too hard with multiple contrasting elements and bright colours that don't suit them.\n\nOn a parting note, get a pair of round toed oxfords for your feet, and keep the accessories to tie plus one maximum.

You can't be self conscious and think all night that you look [Bill Nye the Science Guy](http://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bill-nye.jpg) because it'll just make for a crummy night.\n\nNothing at all wrong with a tie if you aren't digging the bowtie. In fact, at a formal event like prom, a tie might be better. All depends on you and your style.\n\n**Final Tips and Conclusion**\n\nIf you buy a suit and don't plan to tailor everything, go for slim fit shirts. They're going to look 100x better than a \"regular\" fit, unless you're a really big guy.\n\nI really recommend browsing through a few of those videos on Real Men Real Style. He also has a website with tons of articles that almost always have an accompanying video. [Link.](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/) I know it seems like there's a ton of them (because there are, lol) but just browse through what seems relevant to you. The videos are usually pretty short but contain a lot of good info.\n\nI know all this probably seems like a lot, especially if you don't usually dress up very often, but don't let it worry you. It's really not as complicated as it sounds. Just relax and be yourself. Embrace the clothes, you know? Be comfortable in them. Don't put your suit on and feel like a guy in a suit. Feel like a guy that looks like a million bucks. Because you do.\n\n**If you need anything, don't hesitate to contact me.** I can even PM you my email if you want to ask more questions as you buy and stuff. I'd be glad to help.\n\nI hope this was helpful. I spent a solid hour writing it. Lol\n\nTake care!", "id": "d1bkvdv"}, {"comment": ">  I spent a solid hour writing it.\n\nAnd a fine job you did.\n\nJust two comments on the bow ties. The one cotton bow tie I own has more friction than the silk ones.  That makes it a bit trickier to thread through the loop while tying, and a bit harder to adjust. On the flip side, it doesn't loosen as easily, which is an advantage. I'm not sure I'd recommend cotton as the first bow tie for someone learning, but I'm open to other experiences and feedback. \n\nAs for the diamond tip, I have the opposite reaction. They feel less modern and more Dagwood to me (think the Blondie movies, not the comic). But that could be because I got my one and only diamond tip before they started being stylish again, but had been wearing regular bow ties for decades before that. I think they also require a bit more precision in tying to look right. \n\nPS There's nothing wrong in looking like Bill Nye, especially if you're a math or science geek and proud of it. \n\n", "id": "d1bsywk"}, {"comment": "Thank you! I appreciate it!\n\nYes I probably should have mentioned more that cotton/diamond tip is more a personal preference.\n\nI just like the low profile of diamond tip, compared to something like a butterfly, which does stand out a little more. But I'm not bagging on other styles at all though. I hope it didn't seem that way. That's the beauty of individual style! We can like the different varieties and wear them all in such a way that looks great.\n\nAs for Bill Nye, absolutely not! He's awesome! I just pretty much meant that one particular picture, where the tie is loud, really stands out, and has a novelty pattern. But in a picture like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/565528824289300480/wIGnl73l.jpeg), he looks great.\n\ntl;dr - Nothing against other types of bowties or Bill Nye.

It's a lot of fun.\n\nSo, I won't lie, I'm not a big expert on pocket squares. I only get to wear a suit like twice a year, so I usually just go with a white one. But I do know about them, and I will do my best!\n\n**General Rules**\n\nSo the thing with pocket squares is they really aren't supposed to match. At least, not *exactly*. So those [gift sets you see at department stores where the tie and pocket square match EXACTLY?](http://static.hk.groupon-content.net/00/06/1307706850600.jpg) Those are really kind of frowned upon. Why? I don't really know. But the general consensus is that it looks sort of blah and tacky.\n\nPocket squares really are in the eye of the beholder and what look they're going for. Nothing is really set in stone as with other aspects of men's style, but the general rule is that your tie and your pocket square should kind of compliment one another. What you think that means depends on your personal tastes, style, and how \"fashion forward\" you are.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum, the white pocket square can be worn with almost every suit and tie combination, and is clean and classic. [Don Draper](https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/draperpart2.jpg), for example, pretty much always wears a white pocket square, folded like that. Wearing only white pocket squares reflects/compliments his overall style, which is a lot of grey and black suits with a black tie. If this is a style you like, then by all means, do it. *However*, we aren't white collar businessmen in the 1960s, so we can throw in some color and not be scrutinized.\n\nThat brings us to the middle of the spectrum, where we have things like [this.](http://i702.photobucket.com/albums/ww30/theurbangent/pocketsqaureUG1.jpg) They're similar in color, but not at all the exact same fabric. Please note that, except for the bottom right photo, either the pocket square or the tie will have pattern, but not both. This is a pretty safe way to play it, in my opinion.\n\nFinally on the other end, we have stuff like [this](http://www.oliverwicks.com/wysiwyg/ckfinder/userfiles/images/4-outfit-1600x900.jpg), or [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0347/3225/files/complimentarycolors_large.jpg?1395) with complimentary colors. Honestly sometimes today it seems like some guys just grab a tie and pocket square with their eyes closed and head out the door, not looking at all. I personally like them to at least be similar colors (red and orange, blue and purple, etc), but for those with the confidence and the ability to match totally different colors and patterns tastefully, not only with one another, but with their own complextion, it can look nice, but it will always look pretty fashion forward. Especially compared to Don up there with his black tie and white pocket square.\n\n**So what does that mean for you?**\n\nSo, the thing about those bowties is that since we aren't matching the pocket square to their pattern, and they're similar bowties, we can pretty much pick the same pocket squares for either one. If you do hunting yourself, I'd advise that you try and keep materials the same, generally. (So your tie isn't cotton and matte and the square isn't silk and shiny). \n\nSo let's begin! I'm going to try and give you a couple pocket squares from each point in the \"spectrum\" I mentioned above.\n\n**Conservative**\n\nSo at the conservative end, we have the [white pocket square.](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/PC000) Classic and clean for sure, and it will go with the white in your tie.\n\nYou could also go with a [red](http://www.ties.com/ties-com-red-tioga-pocket-square) that matches the red in your tie. Personally I'd lean more toward the white than the red, in order to contrast the black in the suit, but that's just me. If you dig the red, go for that red!\n\n**Middle**\n\nGoing more toward the middle of the spectrum, if you like the clean classic white idea but think it might be a little blah, I'd recommend something like [this](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/PC023) with the red border. Folding it in such a way that it has a little \"pizzaz\" going on, like [this](http://www.societyofrevellers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pocket-sqaURE-banner.jpg), will really let those red edges say hello. I like this one best, by far.\n\n[Here's](http://www.ties.com/ties-com-candy-apple-red-maison-pocket-square) one I quite like. It's mostly red, but with white and black lines.\n\nFinally, [here's](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/PP1425) one that incorporates the dots, but inverted. I kind of like it myself. If I couldn't go with the red border and I was doing the dot tie, I think I'd go with this.\n\n**Fashion Forward**\n\nDisclaimer: I usually don't go for the more fashion forward looks, and on top of that I rarely wear pocket squares and ties, so what I pick here may not look good. *At all.* I think you'd look great in anything above. If you're really wanting something that's way out there though, I'd say search around yourself and find one that you really like, and ask around about it. Maybe even make a new post in MFA.\n\nSo with these really forward ones, in my opinion it's hard to move away from the red in your tie because it's really red. Nothing wrong with it being really red, but going toward pinks and stuff might look like you mismatched and didn't realize. In my opinion. Lol\n\nHonestly though, if you find something you like and have the confidence to go for it, go for it. So, let's see how bad I can mess this up. Lol\n\n[Here's](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/PC812) one with some floral pattern.\n\n[Here's](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/PP1187) another with some red flowers on a navy background. I don't think this one looks half bad, actually.\n\n[Here's](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/PP1182) one that has a kind of bandana pattern on it. Sure to stand out, for better or worse.\n\n**Resources I Used, and Resources for You!**\n\n[How to Fold a Pocket Square](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/ways-fold-pocket-square/)\n\nThere are also literally hundreds of guides and videos online for pocket square folding. Give it a Google if you don't like any of those.\n\n[Intro to Pocket Squares](http://atailoredsuit.com/mens-pocket-squares-intro.html)\n\n[How to Match Tie and Pocket Square](https://www.thedarkknot.com/blogs/suitupdressup/16382465-how-to-match-ties-to-pocket-squares)\n\n**Speaking of Fabric Squares**\n\nBy the way, since we're on the topic, carry a handkerchief to prom. Maybe even two. (One for you, and one in case your date needs it.) One in your jacket pocket, one in your back pocket. (Or wherever you prefer honestly.) You can get them just about anywhere clothes are sold. Just go for 100% cotton, wash them so they soften up a bit, and iron them flat. They're ridiculously useful, especially at social functions. Don't use your pocket square as a handkerchief by the way! Lol\n\nAnyway, why carry a handkerchief?\n\n* Want to be suave as hell if your lady gets a little teary during a romantic moment? Handkerchief.\n\n* Getting a little hot on the dance floor and want to wipe that perspiration off your brow but not onto your sleeve? Handkerchief.\n\n* You or your date spill a little water on yourself/herself and want to dab it up? Handkerchief.\n\n* Got allergies and having issues with the old sniffer? Handkerchief.\n\n[More info on handkerchiefs.](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/03/26/every-man-should-carry-a-handkerchief/)\n\n**To Conclude**\n\nI've done my best here to provide some suggestions and general guidelines to pocket squares. If you don't like anything I picked and want to hunt yourself, do it! I am by no means an expert, and I don't want anything I say here, in any of my posts, to come off like it's the *only* thing. Style (that looks good) does have rules, but so much of it is about you, your personality, the impression you want to give, and your personal tastes.\n\nWell, that was probably my longest post yet.

We dress how we dress to signal things to others. Success, personality, wealth, and of course attractiveness.\n\nYeah there's people of different sexuality dressing every which way, but there is some truth to the idea that many people dress towards the stereotype that society assumes applies to them, simply to let people know who they are. If you're a single guy looking for a girl, but everyone you meet on the street thinks you're categorically not into them due to your sexuality, you aren't going to have much luck. Same goes the other way. I know guys who are into guys and wear camo, boots and carhartts.

If you have ever consumed media about fashion you know that you don't have to follow every rule, and not all of them apply to wear you will. Live is the equivalent of a bunch of South Americans coming on here claiming this article is garbage because it doesn't get cold enough to wear a parka. Skip that step.\n\n\n3. Turtle necks ARE in, and they look fantastic. I picked up a few and wear one almost every week and agree they can be dressed up or down, and versatility is really what makes me more likely to include something in my wardrobe.\n\n\n4. It's always good to find to a way to accessorize (like with a tie) and not be overdressed for the situation (like if you were to potentially wear a jacket). This is perfect winter dinner wear and would have been great advice before your Christmas party.\n\n\n5.Layering is fun, and Kanye certainly does take something to the extreme but he is a style symbol for a reason. If going over the top doesn't apply to you, you dont have the balls to do it, it's not geographically or age approrpiate you can still learn something from this tip:  Wearing a t-shirt that's longer than your sweater, which is longer than your jacket can look good. I have found that t-shirts that are just an inch or two longer than a sweater or cardigan can look pretty good and make for interesting proportions.\n\n\nIt's almost as if you guys can't take these tips and think about how they apply to you. You don't watch a run way show and replicate the looks when you go to work the next day, you look for trends and styles and try to apply them to your wardrobe. I guarentee even if it was passively you may have still taken some things away from this, but try and do it actively.  I 'm not saying GQ is a style standard, really I don't like a lot of their fits but I'm just so confused how you guys can't get good information out of what is actually a fairly good list of tips for winter wear. This a fashion forum. Try new things, do something weird, it's not all OCBD, cable knit sweaters and dark denim.

Im interested in how Rock/Moto and Rough/Outdoorsy but not sleek combine.  \n\nA few things.  I live in NYC and have traveled to LA dozens of times.  People in Brooklyn certainly dress a lot like MFA people dress; at one point a few years ago, I couldn't get on the L train without seeing at least 5 people in Raws, a buttondown/grey sweatshirt and Red Wings/Wolverine 1k's.  I can't get on the L train today without seeing at least 5 pairs of Stan Smiths on top of Navy/Olive Chino's with a button down or Chambray of somekind.  Its true that not all of Brooklyn is dressed like that (I don't live in that part of Brooklyn afterall), but other places in Brooklyn are not at all what you describe (people around me don't really care what they dress like, like the vast majority of people).\n\nWhat people in music wear out is usually absurdly expensive designer clothing they got for free so they could promote the brand.  Or if they are off, they wear what people here wear (Sweatshirt/Hoodie/Sweater over Button Down/Henly with Jeans/Chino and Lows/Birks/Boots).  If you aren't a person whose \"made it\" in music, you are wearing whatever to your next gig, because your next gig is much more important than what you wear, and I guarantee you that 9 times out of 10 it will be some variation of the MFA Uniform with a slightly local flavor thrown in (flower shirt here, Supreme piece there).  \n\nIf you work in fashion, you wear what people here more or less wear.  Chinos/Jeans, Button down and a pair of lows/boots/birks and a local company piece. Its not like you magically have a 90% discount on everything in stock because you work at the company; standard discounts are 30% off (and SLP at 30% off is still several hundred dollars).  They look well put together, but its not really hard to look well put together.

I'm operating under the assumption that the whole catalog is available online, but I'm honestly not sure, so you could be right. \n\nThat said, the evidence, so to speak, makes me think the piece isn't actually sold anywhere else. I did look for it online with other stockists - Amazon, Backcountry, STP - and I couldn't find it. And I certainly understand that MSRPs are to some extent function a of marketing, but a basic tenet of an MSRP or list price is that implied savings have to be real, not imaginary, right? IANAL, but the Michael Kors settlement I mentioned in the post seems to suggest that using a fictional list price that implies some level of savings is actually against the law since it's injurious to the consumer. MK wouldn't have paid a $5 million settlement if it was just friendly shenanigans.\n\nI think the case would be more tenuous if I had purchased the cruiser from a third party retailer, but in this case, Filson is both manufacturer and seller. If they create a garment and tell me it's worth $1,000 so I'll buy it on sale for $500, that feels dishonest unless they actually sold it for $1,000 at some point in time. Again, I could be completely wrong about this. Maybe Filson did actually sell the cruiser I bought for $198 at one point.  I honestly don't know, but I couldn't find anything suggesting that was the case, so I'm dubious - hence the post.\n\nFinally, I don't think they actually could have sold the jacket I got for $198. As I noted, it's thin, light, and just plain flimsy relative to the original cruiser that actually does retail for $198. It feels appropriate for an outlet, not for mainline retail.

Not sure what line MK stepped over to actually lose their legal battle.  Hell if this was highly illegal I don't know how yoox stays around because a majority of their items have completely winged ballpark MSRPs.    \n\nAlso, from the pictures you uploaded the cruiser looks to use the same patterns, construction, and hardware as the tin cloth short cruiser.  Some people might actually want a lighter and thinner fabric cruiser. Plus, you can't really judge the strength of a fabric from hand feel and weight alone.  I had an item made out of a nylon taffeta weave that felt like saran wrap, but upon wearing it I learned it was extraordinarily durable.", "id": "czphpjz"}, {"comment": "All true. It sounded like MK's style of price manipulation was pervasive and egregious, whereas the shadiness here (if that's what actually happened) is on a much smaller scale. Also you're right on the materials. I certainly don't have a way of testing the strength of the fabric. Both the sale cruiser and original cruiser are 100% cotton, albeit in different weights. The pattern and hardware, as far as I can tell, are basically the same with the exception of hand warmer pockets (sale cruiser has none). I suppose I would suggest that in general (though not always), the weight of a cotton fabric tends to be indicative of quality and durability. Obviously there are many examples where that's not the case, but having handled both the original cruiser and the sale variant, I don't think this is such an exception. That's just my perception, which is by no means definitive, but if you held both jackets I think you might agree with me.\n\nIf the sale cruiser's cotton is just as durable as the original cruiser, then I'm probably wrong about the whole post. Honestly, that would be fine with me since I'd feel better about buying Filson products. To your point, I can understand the desire for a lighter and thinner jacket. But I don't think there's any reason to remove the hand warmer pockets other than as a cost-cutting measure. If the pockets were left out to keep manufacturing costs down, it's not much of a leap to arrive at the idea that they used lighter fabric because it's cheaper - cheaper and lighter being lower quality more often than not .", "id": "czpj723"}], [{"comment": "The most suspicious thing in this case is that they totally got rid of the garment you bought after you brought this up to them.  \"Oh shit!

Kinda hard to communicate that without feeling it. Admittedly, the product description on this cruiser did say \"lightweight\". I think an $80 price tag on this thing could actually be reasonable.

Now when you take this idea of western fashion and put it in a place with its own unique culture and style, one which is much more fluid and based around a far more transcendental view of life, you get this incredible design of western fashion, with this injection of color, and this structure that isn't so put together and more, how you put it, having fun.

Trendy koreans still look better than trendy Americans.  Picture someone wearing all trendy clothes, so like, Canada Goose jacket, Levi jeans, Timberland boots, Carhart hat, Burberry scarf...they still don't seem to look as good as someone following the korean trends.  They'd be wearing all this next level shit instead, like in the two albums I posted.  But not of their own volition and preference, they'd still just be following trends.  It's just...*their* trends are more creative than ours.  They'd be playing with layering and textures and geometry and cuts and lengths and materials and colors, and it makes American fashion trends look like kids playing dress up with a boring catalog.
