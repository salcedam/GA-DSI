Teach me about \"Frugal house buying.\"", "id": "czh2fjd"}, {"comment": "First, you need to pick a house that positions everyone in it to live a low cost life.  I'd say the key points here are:\n\n* A short walk to the park.  The park is a GREAT place to hang out, relax, stretch the legs, or read a book.  This will save you so much money in entertainment expenses.  Though the kids may grow up wanting you to buy them sports uniforms, kayaks, and hiking boots.  :-)\n* Ability to walk or bike to the store.  Can be the difference between a one-car household and a two-car household.  That's worth tens of thousands.\n* A short commute.  Saves time and money.\n* A place you'll want to stay in for the better part of a decade.  Closing and moving costs are substantial; don't want to do it twice.\n* Nothing extravagant.  There are much cheaper ways to impress people than with a house.\n\nSo you've walked through a number of neighborhoods and picked one out.  You want to start making offers on houses.  As with many things, if you're willing to do your homework up front, and do some of the leg work yourself, you can save a bundle.  Consider a $200,000 house on the market.  Typical overhead on the sale is something like this:\n\n* 4% = $8000 for the seller's agent ($0 if for sale by owner)\n* 2% = $4000 for the buyer's agent ($0 if for sale by owner)\n* $800 for the seller's attorney (maybe necessary)\n* $400 for the buyer's attorney (I skipped this entirely, over the objections of the seller's attorney.  Being my own attorney was actually easier, as it cut out a middleman in the communications)\n* $300 home inspection (okay)\n* $5000 mortgage origination fees (pay cash if at all possible!)\n\nSome of these costs are fairly well hidden, and I get the impression that many home buyers don't really know about them.\n\nI needed a mortgage for my first house, but I plan to buy a second house on the same block as an investment property in a few years.  I'll sell my stocks, leverage the equity in my house if needed, then make a lowball offer.  An offer that is \"cash, no inspection\" is a guaranteed deal that is very attractive to sellers' agents, and cuts 6 weeks out of the closing process.", "id": "czh4rav"}, {"comment": "Thanks for taking the time to write this detailed post.

Use a fuel consumption display.  Set it to trip MPG. \"That which is measured, improves.\"\n> 12. Leave early and don't rush.  Leaving your mind unstressed and free to focus on the art and science of efficient driving will do wonders.  \n\nPut some thought into every little thing you've done, and you'll quickly develop good driving habits.  Such as increasing your following distance so you can brake less often, especially if you're behind an impatient driver.  Combining trips intelligently, and picking routes with fuel consumption in mind.  This often leads you to realize taking the expressway isn't always a great idea.\n\nBefore I bought a hybrid, I was beating the EPA fuel economy ratings by about 30% without slowing down much.

My daughter, who was completely healthy her first year of life, was diagnosed with epilepsy this past year. We have fantastic health insurance and met our deductible within the first month of her illness so we're only paying 20 percent of her medical bills, and we're still out thousands this year. In fact, I have about $400 in ER bills on my table from November. (an ER visit when her fever hit 105 and she had a seizure even while medicated. Plus she's having another brain MRI in two weeks and the copay on that sucker is like $350) Additionally, infants go to the doctor monthly for shots and checkups, toddlers and children visit the doctor often for checkups, and kids STAY sick. Plus they are little patient zeroes that get you sick every time they have an -itis. In the last two months I've missed 6 days of work because of illnesses between my daughter and myself. My daughter now sees a team of specialists at a great hospital for her epilepsy...and each doctor on the team charges a separate bill. At this point I can't afford to even look at a doctor for myself,lol.\n\nFor diapers, 1-2K  for a child that can wear \"normal/cheap\" diapers is a good estimate. We cloth diapered (About $600) ours while I stayed home because her skin was so sensitive (chemical burns from disposable) but now that  she's in care I have to buy disposables- at about $50 a week or $2600 a year. Her sensitive butt also has to have sensitive wipes, so that's another $500-700 bucks.\n\n We adopted so I couldn't breastfeed (didn't have enough time to try hormone therapy) and our formula was about $36/week or $1800 that first year.\n Clothing is a joke, man. They outgrow EVERYTHING so fast! There were things that she only wore once or not at all, and when she hit a growth spurt at 13 months I literally bought her a new pair of shoes every two weeks. I don't even want to think about clothing and shoes expenses but I have spent at least $2500 a year because those tiny things are not cheap. \n\nToys and books are other big expenses for us, simply because my kid is very big on books and figures out toys so quickly. She's smart, and I'm constantly trying to keep her stimulated to encourage that. I bet we spend about 1K-2K a year or more on toys/books, and that's buying a lot of them second hand. \n\nWe also do activities now that she's two. We have memberships to the zoo, museums, local play centers, and she takes dance and gymnastics. She's begging to play basketball next year when she's 3 and old enough, so that will be another $40 a month plus expenses.\n\nI'd estimate that with all the expenses listed above plus our $12k a year in childcare, we probably spend around $22-$25k a year on one child. You don't have to do all of these things, but it's easy to spend $$$ when you have a kid because you want to give them every opportunity that you feasibly can. For us, it's even more so because our daughter was adopted after several pregnancy/infant losses; sometimes I feel that I spoil her extra for the ones that I lost, you know? Pregnancy/easy child birth isn't an option for a lot of people, so that is something that you also have to factor in when trying to prepare for having kids. We had no clue that we would have fertility problems so we didn't factor that in when we started saving for a baby and trying to conceive. It seems so easy, but child bearing doesn't always just happen naturally. Fertility treatments, medical interventions, pregnancy losses (Especially in states where they are considered abortions and not completely covered by insurances) and adoption (avg. private baby adoptions are $25k-$75k, even foster care adoptions are not completely free) all add up.

They don't eat much until they get bigger. Clothing? There are consignment sales. Our daughter is 7 and I don't think we've spend $2k on her clothes if you add up all seven years.\n\nBut other expenses are harder to manage. Childcare is huge. Roughly $800 per month until she was old enough for preschool. Then $400 per month for preschool. Public school is far cheaper, but still it's $1500 for after school, and approx. $200ish per week while school is out.

"], [1, "My two kids go to a cheap daycare. It still costs more than our rent."], [1, "I have five young kids at home, one that has left home, and one on the way. Here's my take:\n\nClothes don't have to be expensive at all. _If_ you are lucky enough to have relatives with kids, you might be able to get tons of hand-me-downs. We are in that position; in fact we have a relative who runs clothing resale shops. She combs through the incoming stuff and once in a while brings us a trash bag of barely-used clothes. A lot of it we don't like, so we just pass that stuff on, but there's enough left to clothe everyone. In fact we just got rid of an outfit that has been handed down five times and the fabric was pretty much disintegrating (sadly). We got good use out of that outfit!\n\nFood can be a pain; my wife and I cook very frugally (bone broth, lots of things from scratch, buying in bulk, etc.) but a couple of the kids are very picky eaters. It's easy to say \"well, either the kid eats what is served or the kid doesn't eat\" but some kids (especially with autism or related sensory issues) may actually starve themselves and you might need to buy or make separate meals that child is willing to eat if you don't want the child to be actually malnourished.\n\nSomething that list doesn't include is wear and tear on your home. Very spirited kids who are super-active or love to figure out how things are put together will break every goddamn thing in your home. One of my kids tears off wallpaper, draws on every surface possible, crams things into heating vents, opens child-proof bottles, deliberately flooded the bathroom, knocked the blades off the ceiling fans... it's just... amazing. Little darling has done literally thousands and thousands of dollars worth of damage to our home. They don't teach you that in parent school. Others in the family -- never did anything like that. Siblings can be _extremely_ different.\n\nEntertainment expenses don't have to be that big but bored kids will make your life miserable. We try to teach them early on to use art supplies (we use a LOT of art supplies) and make things when they don't have chores or school work.\n\nThe biggest thing is that kids bring chaos, and chaos can be expensive.\n\nI am not really looking forward to the years when 3-4 of them are teenagers at once. We are actually working on a \"teenager food fund\" to cushion the shock of those years. We expect to have two full-sized freezers with a pig and a cow in them, pantry room filled with canned food, and I hope by then we will be growing all our own greens 8 months out of the year.\n\nOh yes... there also aren't that many cheap cars that will hold a family of 7-8 with multiple child car seats of different types.\n\nAnd... child car seats of different types. You can only clean and reuse them so long.\n"], [1, "Lol.

My brother, by contrast, had multiple cavities, needed orthodontic work, and oral surgery to remove an extra tooth in the roof of his mouth. We both brushed our teeth the same way and ate roughly the same food, so you can't blame him for not taking care of them properly.

Here's my take:\n\nClothes don't have to be expensive at all. _If_ you are lucky enough to have relatives with kids, you might be able to get tons of hand-me-downs. We are in that position; in fact we have a relative who runs clothing resale shops. She combs through the incoming stuff and once in a while brings us a trash bag of barely-used clothes. A lot of it we don't like, so we just pass that stuff on, but there's enough left to clothe everyone. In fact we just got rid of an outfit that has been handed down five times and the fabric was pretty much disintegrating (sadly). We got good use out of that outfit!\n\nFood can be a pain; my wife and I cook very frugally (bone broth, lots of things from scratch, buying in bulk, etc.) but a couple of the kids are very picky eaters. It's easy to say \"well, either the kid eats what is served or the kid doesn't eat\" but some kids (especially with autism or related sensory issues) may actually starve themselves and you might need to buy or make separate meals that child is willing to eat if you don't want the child to be actually malnourished.\n\nSomething that list doesn't include is wear and tear on your home. Very spirited kids who are super-active or love to figure out how things are put together will break every goddamn thing in your home. One of my kids tears off wallpaper, draws on every surface possible, crams things into heating vents, opens child-proof bottles, deliberately flooded the bathroom, knocked the blades off the ceiling fans... it's just... amazing. Little darling has done literally thousands and thousands of dollars worth of damage to our home. They don't teach you that in parent school. Others in the family -- never did anything like that. Siblings can be _extremely_ different.\n\nEntertainment expenses don't have to be that big but bored kids will make your life miserable. We try to teach them early on to use art supplies (we use a LOT of art supplies) and make things when they don't have chores or school work.\n\nThe biggest thing is that kids bring chaos, and chaos can be expensive.\n\nI am not really looking forward to the years when 3-4 of them are teenagers at once. We are actually working on a \"teenager food fund\" to cushion the shock of those years. We expect to have two full-sized freezers with a pig and a cow in them, pantry room filled with canned food, and I hope by then we will be growing all our own greens 8 months out of the year.\n\nOh yes... there also aren't that many cheap cars that will hold a family of 7-8 with multiple child car seats of different types.\n\nAnd... child car seats of different types. You can only clean and reuse them so long.\n", "id": "damexyf"}], [{"comment": "Lol.

You can feed 2 people for an entire month for $200.\n\nEssentials should be based not just on nutrition but on what you both will actually eat. Don't waste money buying stuff you're not going to eat.

I recommend having the same thing for breakfast every day, and/or the same thing for lunch, then switch up your dinners. For example you can have oatmeal for breakfasts, or yogurt, or scrambled eggs. A dozen eggs will last 2 people almost all week if you both have 2 eggs for breakfast. Lunches can be peanut butter and jam sandwiches. or whatever\n\nBuy dinner stuff you can make many different things from, and avoid premade foods. For example for the price of a single bag of tater tots, that will only last 1-2 meals, you can buy a 10-pound bag of potatoes. For the price of a few of those rice-type dinner entrees, you can buy a 10-pound bag of rice. \n\nSo first off make a meal plan of easy, inexpensive meals and go from there.

As it is illegal, this would put Toyota at risk for a major lawsuit.  \n\nDo you understand why it is illegal to shift your transmission into neutral in most cars?  It is because disengaging the transmission from the engine prevents you from using engine braking, and many people used to coast down hills this way, using their brakes to maintain speed.  This causes the brakes to overheat and ultimately fail, causing an accident.\n\nBesides, when you coast in neutral in a regular car, your engine must maintain idle and uses gas to do that.

Many people to this day will still  live in one city and will travel to another to avoid paying sales tax on things like vehicles.     Tax avoidance lowers your tax bill by structuring your transactions so that you reap the largest tax benefits.I will travel 20 miles to go across the border into Oklahoma from Arkansas if it means paying less tax due to Oklahoma having a lower tax rate _Tax avoidance is completely legal\u2014and extremely wise for this reason.  My city taxes are at 9.95% and some cities in Oklahoma are lower.   On a new car,  that means a huge savings. \n     But as they say... Tax evasion, on the other hand, is an attempt to reduce your tax liability by deceit, subterfuge, or concealment. Tax evasion is a crime. For example, if you live in Louisiana, which has a 9% sales tax, and purchased a $350,000 motorhome, you\u2019d have to pay over $31,000 in sales taxes. This was the situation faced by a Louisiana taxpayer. However, instead of paying all that sales tax in Louisiana, this taxpayer decided to form a limited liability company (LLC) in Montana, which has no sales taxes. He had the LLC purchase the motorhome in its name and registered it in Montana. He paid no Louisiana sales tax at all. In fact, all he paid was a $174 fee to register the motorhome in Montana. But he got caught in time.  The Louisiana Department of Revenue found out about the purchase and claimed that the buyer personally owed the state over $30,000 in sales taxes, and tacked on an additional $16,000 in fines and penalties. The Louisiana taxpayer fought the tax assessment all the way through the Louisiana Supreme Court, where he was ultimately victorious. Additionally, since he kept the motorhome garaged in Mississippi, not Louisiana, no state use tax was due (the use tax would have been in the same amount as the sales tax). (Thomas v. Bridges, 2013-C-1855 (Sup.Ct. LA May 7, 2014).The court held that he had formed a valid LLC under Montana law. \n\nThese facts alone are enough reason to keep discussing this and not block the discussion by banning some subjects and not others.

It was good choices, good practices, and yes work too.\n\nYou will note that I didn't define how to escape from poverty as hard work. You should go back and re-read because I was very explicit. The key to escaping poverty is to abandon the chase for normal existence. When you are poor you can't afford cable TV and new cars and living in a house and everything else that most people take for granted. If you try to get those things you will always be poor. You must step back and limit yourself to just what you need. Not what society says you need, but real needs.\n\nThat was the great challenge my parents faced, and it took them years to let go of the chase for normal. Even when they did they made mistakes. Their first try was to buy an old bus because it was as big as an apartment, bit it was still too much. They couldn't stop being broke with that thing around their necks. They then went to a van, an old beat up van, and that was cheap enough that they could stop being broke. They first tried RV parks that are a lot less expensive than apartments, but still want hundreds a month compared to national forest and BLM land which is free so long as you keep moving, or at most a few bucks a night in developed camp sites. All of that is part of one road from poverty to non-poverty. I won't say that road is the only one, but I think the letting go of expectations of normalcy is common to all.\n\nIt's not luck that a bass player can play the bass.

It was luck for you that your parents made the decisions that they did, because you personally didn't make them do that through your own skills or acquired knowledge. It was luck that you didn't get any crippling diseases when you were a kid. It was luck that your parents' friends themselves didnt have enough misfortune in their life that might have prevented them from helping you do much.\n\nIf it's a defense mechanism for the crabs in the pot to dismiss any escape as a fluke, it's also a defense mechanism for any of the escapees to dismiss the random chances that aided their escape.

A lot of it was realizing that most of the talk about luck and outside influences is a way to dismiss evidence that escape is possible.

You see that someone has escaped the pot, and are afraid that the evidence of possible success could lead to a max exodus, so you start telling people that the escape was a fluke.

Not even close.\n\nAnyone with a TV can watch television news, but not everyone with a TV does. This has nothing to do with luck. It has nothing to do with work. Some people are willing to watch TV news, some aren't.\n\nThe concept of luck only enters into it if you assume that one choice is obviously universally superior to the other. If you believe that those who watch TV news somehow have it \"better\" than those who don't. In that case the people who happen to tune to a news program and decide they are interested \"got lucky\" compared to the people who didn't. That's absurd. \n\nIt is equally absurd to think that escaping poverty is evidence of \"luck\". Beyond absurd, it is classist and bigoted.  It implies that there is something wrong with people who are in poverty, or something better about those who aren't.\n\nPoverty is a measure of ability to produce resources vs the resources required to operate. If you produce less than you need, you are impoverished. You can be impoverished while producing $1,000 a year, or $1,000,000 a year. Think that's absurd? Imagine you were living on a space station, depending on extremely expensive rockets for food, etc. You could easily be producing millions in value and still not enough to pay for rockets to ship your food to you. That is an extreme example but there is a point: poverty really is relative to environment. In the USA on average the poverty line is north of $10,000. In parts of Africa it is a tenth of that. \n\nTo escape poverty you must either increase production or reduce consumption. The trap of poverty is that while you are in it, your ability to make changes needed to do either of those is constrained by a lack of resources. The solution, as I've been saying consistently, is to forget about normal expectations. This allows you to spend less of the resources you are producing on keeping up with your peer group, and more on increasing your future production capacity. After production increases, you can think about slowly increasing consumption. \n\nLuck is not a factor.", "id": "cztr36f"}, {"comment": "We'll have to agree to disagree here.

My mother was a cancer survivor, my father had health issues of his own, my brother was schizophrenic, and all of that limits you in one way or another. Mom's medical bills removed the chance of a mortgage and her health made a steady job difficult. Dad's health impacted his employment stability. My brother would get us evicted, or vehicles impounded, or end up with court fees and the like.

Still couldn't find anything! So my dad and I decided to make something.  \n  \nI wanted the industrial look because it was clean, bold, and simple. I went to my parents house and my dad and I searched in the back shed through all of his wood stash until we found some perfect pieces. We came up with a simple design of a sturdy top with a hanging bottom shelf, then went into town to Home Depot and bough the pipe needed for $170.  \n  \nThe next Saturday I went back to my parents' and we built it in about 5 hours. It looks great! It's not perfect because it has a rustic charm to it, so it's not perfectly square, but it looks amazing and I love it. Now if I could only find a nice piece of art to go above it...", "id": "cz7t0x7"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cz7v4k3"}, {"comment": "Obviously they don't look weird to me. They are industrial pipes that I like, that will last and can be reused in the future for other projects once I don't need the stand anymore. What you linked me I think is all ugly and I don't believe of the same quality, but I could be wrong there. I'm happy I made something I think is gorgeous. I picked out this look after months of already looking for a reasonable, quality tv stand, and started doing internet searches for this style. People make things like this and sell them for about $400+. I was able to get thick, sturdy, gorgeous wood for free that is nicer looking than what is available in stores. I had the source to build exactly what I wanted at no cost to myself. The pipe was expensive, but given what people charge for similar pieces and that this will last and be able to be utilized in other ways later on in life....yes I think it's frugal.

That's why you have insurance. \n\n(Edit: looking in your post history: \"I have approx 9k in equity in the home, and I don't have the 5k just lying in my savings account.\" Pretty sure the answer to \"do you have a few hundred k saved up\" is still no.)\n\nIn another post you said: \n\n> even possibilities I haven't considered\n\nSure. Your kid gets diabetes tomorrow. $10,000 to get diagnosed in the ER. $1500+ for your first visit to the endocrinologist with some bloodwork (plus we'll throw in $500 each for a diabetes educator and dietician.) $250 for glucagon. $7000 for an insulin pump. $1200 for a CGM.  That's startup. $350 a month for sensors, $250+ a month for pump supplies, $300+ a month in insulin, $150+ a month for test strips. (Plus followup visits. Other specialists. Complications. Replacing devices.) And diabetes isn't even one of the really expensive chronic illnesses you could develop. \n\nA 50k savings account can be wiped out about 2 weeks into a cancer diagnosis if you're paying cash, and that's without needing any surgeries. What's your plan for taking care of yourself or your family when the money runs dry? How are you going to pay to see doctors? The pharmacy?\n\nInsurance doesn't make sense just because it pays for the $65 well-visits to your doctor every year. It makes sense so you are insured if something goes *seriously wrong.*\n\n>  The idea here is to put what I would have paid to the insurance company into a private account every single month that I can draw from for emergencies\n\n450 (assuming you put away the same amount post-tax) times 12 is $5400 a year.

As you said, i don't have a stack just lying around.

There are already countless victims out there who are buried in medical debt even though they have insurance.

The cancer center isn't going to give you chemotherapy with an IOU. The device company isn't going to give you your insulin pump with the bill coming in 90 days. Imaging centers usually expect payment before service. Most specialists will expect payment at the time of service for cash pay patients. The transplant center isn't going to give you the kidney they know you don't have $20,000 a year to pay towards anti-rejection medications for, much less a few hundred thousand in doctor and procedure costs. The hospital isn't going to book a non-emergency surgery you can't pay for and are uninsured unless you qualify for some charity care. The rehabilitation center after your car accident isn't going to admit you without a means to pay them. \n\nYou're making the incredibly generous assumption that you'll be given the same care and simply be given the opportunity to \"go into\" unlimited amounts of debt you assign no real value to. **That is not how the world works.** Many of the services you need throughout the process of a major accident or illness are pay-as-you-go. \n\nIn the diabetes scenario, here's how it plays out for the poor and uninsured in the US. Here's how it played out for many many more people before ACA added pre-existing condition protections so people with chronic illnesses could get insured: \n\n- You get the ER to write off most of the bill or put you on an eternal payment plan, or you give them a fake number and hope the debt collectors don't find you.\n\n- You'll go into a bit of CC debt or dip into your diminishing savings to be able to see the endocrinologist once. Probably can't afford anyone else upfront. Everything will be harder and more confusing without being able to visit a specialist whenever you need them. Maybe your family doctor will prescribe you refills. Sure, they're not a specialist, but it's better than dying right? \n\n- You'll rush to apply for medicaid or whatever the hell other program you hope will cover your kid and wait a few weeks or months of hell in between trying to get approved, or wait until you next qualify for insurance through your job. \n\n- Your kid doesn't get the CGM or the insulin pump. They don't get the fine tuned control without as many highs and lows, to feel better, to be flexible, or to live longer with less complications. You don't get to sleep at night without wondering if they wont die of low blood sugar tonight. You can't afford it.\n\n- Maybe you can afford insulin vials and syringes (you probably can't afford pens) and enough test strips. Maybe not. Maybe you'll have to decide what's *really important* this month and which bills can be late. \n\nThat's real life. That's what happened to a lot of Americans before ACA offered pre-existing condition coverage. That's what still happens to those who don't have insurance. \n\nThe system is broken. The prices are too high, and the regulation and standardization is too low. (We'd probably all be better off with a universal, single-payer system like other countries.)

I think what you really want to do instead of just make as little money as possible is probably work freelance, so you can work less than 40 hours a week and set your own schedule, but you're not working a soul-sucking minimum wage job and living in the crappiest apartment you can find.

A single, new strut will run from about $50-150 (depending on if it's a separate shock, or an entire strut assembly). Lightbulb will cost $5. Oil change stuff will cost about $30 (oil + filter, which should always be changed at the same time). Assuming you're driving some sort of average car (10 year old Honda Accord, for example), it probably has the more expensive strut design for the front, but the overall cost of parts is relatively low. \n\nYou could have purchased everything for about $235 at an auto parts store. Most shops purchase parts from these same auto parts stores (I did commercial sales for one of these companies for years -- selling generic parts to your average mechanics). They get a discount, depending on the part, how much they order, etc -- and then typically mark up the part to regular retail, if they're honest. So the idea of \"buying the parts yourself and taking them to a mechanic\" (a suggestion I've seen way too often) doesn't normally save you too much money, and typically pisses off your average mechanic. \n\nA brake job is about 4 hours worth of work. The strut adds another hour. Oil change about 30 mins. Bulb, I can do one-handed while answering a phone, so it shouldn't even be billed as \"labor\". Most independent shops charge about $100 / hour for labor. So, parts and labor, spending $7-800 on all of these repairs is pretty average.\n\nCould you have saved a lot of money doing it yourself? Yes. But not everybody is capable / confident enough to do auto repair. The lightbulb would have been easy, but wouldn't have made a huge deal on the end price. Next easiest is the oil change -- easy, but requires jacks, jack stands, oil catch pan, wrench, oil filter wrench... all of the tools would cost you another $100, if you had to buy everything. And not everyone can do oil changes at home (I've lived in several apartments that forbid auto maintenance, specifically with oil changes in mind, as they didn't want stains). Struts and brakes would require more complicated tools, and better knowledge of auto repair. And if your car has drum brakes in the rear (common on older / economy cars, as well as trucks and SUVs), there's lots of little brake hardware that needs to be replaced with every service -- tiny clips and springs, that are easy to break or lose. If you don't know what you're doing putting them back together, they could become inoperable. \n\n**TL;DR:** the /r/frugal answer is to do it yourself (which would have cost you under $250), but that takes time away from your day, and not everybody is able to (lack of knowledge / skill, or unfriendly apartments). What you paid was fairly \"industry standard\" pricing. \n\nBonus tip: find a regular, independent mechanic (not a chain shop, like AAMCO). Get on a first name basis. Bring him beer. It's amazing how much they can negotiate on price, when you offer them a 6-pack. I've even had tires patched and aired for free, minus the cost of beer.

I'm not sure what would have happened if I was driving somewhere and it damaged my car further. Which is why I take my car to a mechanic so he can  look at my whole car.

[A quick Google search](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=average+cost+per+hour+for+auto+repair) reveals that most mechanics charge between $80-100 / hour for labor charges. In my area, the average is around $100-120 / hour. Really isn't that crazy. Shops have overhead. They have insurance, they have computer systems with crazy-expensive licensing agreements, that are necessary to diagnose modern cars. They have the cost of tools, utilities and employees. Auto shops are very expensive to run. At $100 / hour, there's several shops that are still barely scraping by. \n\nI do know a few shade-tree mechanics who will work for cheaper (typically around $50-60 / hour). Most of these types of mechanics work from home, and don't carry the same insurances as full shops (or any extra insurance, at all). So if the property catches fire and your car gets damaged, you could be left liable for your own damages. \n\nIf you really want to find cheap shop rates, my best suggestion is to find a community college with an automotive program. Most of these will take in customer cars. The work will be performed by students, but overseen by instructors who are certified techs. Nothing leaves the shop without being triple checked by the instructors.

Credit cards impact your score by calculating your total utilization. It doesn't matter how much $ you have charged it's how much of your available balance you're using. You went from 0% to 0% so I can guarantee that did not impact the number.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of other factors and I would wager that spending too long a time without having installment debt or a mortgage is what did it. Lenders want to see someone who is able to take out loans and repay them. So if you never take out loans that is seen as a \"bad\" thing.\n\n\nDo you have a mortgage, or an auto loan or anything like that? ", "id": "d2damcf"}, {"comment": "Nope. I've got 0 debt.

I can't imagine why I would see a 13 point decrease - nothing is different about this month - which was what drove me to post in the first place. \nI get that credit scores are somewhat of a game, and I realize that I'm still in the top whatever percentile - it's the fact that it seems like a moving target that pisses me off. I feel like I'm doing he right thing and being frugal and very responsible but now I'm being marginally dinged, and for what? Some invisible thing I didn't do. It's odd. ", "id": "d2e06yo"}, {"comment": "Zero debt is almost definitely why your score dropped. As counterintuitive as it sounds having a period of no debt can negatively impact your score. A credit score is supposed to be a reflection of how well you handle having debt. So the thought behind that portion of the algorithm is \"this person has not had to budget for any large fixed payments for 3 years. Will they be able to handle the shock of having a large fixed payment all of a sudden? Will they be able to budget for it?\" \n\nIt sucks because you sound like a very responsible guy and I'm sure your real risk is probably more closely aligned with someone in the mid to high 800s. But they don't know you personally so they have to bucket you based on historical trends and there is a slight trend that people who take a a significant portion of time off from having any installment debt sometimes tend to struggle when taking on new debt. \n\nI have seen people buy a cd and then immediately get a secured loan using their new cd as collateral just so they can have installment debt to keep their score up. basically borrowing money money from themselves and paying a bank interest to record it with the bureaus. \n\nI understand where you're coming from but if it makes you feel any better you're still a super prime borrower and could walk into any bank and get just about any loan you want. As a banker I wish I had more customers like you. ", "id": "d2e2bqy"}, {"comment": "That's not quite directly true. Inactivity for a long period of time can lead to accounts being closed.

Solid advice. But, if you really want to save, you also need to be judicious about eating in restaurants. I save it for special occasions.\n\nWhy is it ok to buy drinks in vending machines? Most of what you can get is really bad for you, which makes it the most expensive, negatively performing investment you can make: costly now (because it's completely unnecessary) and even costlier down the line. How about, switch to water unless it's a real treat (like a hot summer day)? Or how about, make your own coffee, or switch to black coffee at a cheaper coffee shop, and add a bit of milk? I drink the coffee at work, because when I tried it, I found it palatable, and it's free. And I look more productive than people who pop out to buy coffee (it takes at LEAST 20 minutes!). Even if I chat with someone in the lunch room for 10 mins when I get it, building relationships with my colleagues, it's STILL less time. And again, it's free. Obviously if you find your work coffee unpalatable it's not an option (or if they don't provide). In this case, start a coffee pool with some friends.\n\nThen there are the elephants in the room: transportation. Why on earth would you pay for new car payments, gas and expensive parking when you can live nearer work or on a transit line? I bike to work, and on very rainy days I bus in and walk home. My bike ride is 25 min each way, and my walk home is 1 hr and 15 mins. People don't think I'm poor, or any other ridiculous stigma. They think I'm really badass because most weather doesn't daunt me. This is a huge one - if you have car payments, gas and parking to pay, you are seriously missing out on *anything* else you could do with that money. This goes double for a couple commuting separately. Not to mention the efficiency: I get my exercise in on the way to and from work, so I feel zero guilt about not heading out to a spin class when I really just want dinner.\n\nLittle things like hanging up the laundry prolongs the life of your clothes by at least double, and saves you a decent chunk of money. If your drying line is above your head, it's a killer shoulder workout. Don't believe me? Try hanging 3 loads and later taking them down. Even in winter I hang them indoors and it's fine - and my clothing budget is basically zero, and my power bill reduced too. They wouldn't dare suggest in an article like this that you give up a god-given necessity like electric clothes drying.\n\nThis is a very weak-sauce article to my mind. It's basically good if you don't know where to start, and making too much change at once sounds daunting. You know, like baby diet steps: add a small salad with dinner, and work to more and bigger changes from there.", "id": "d0433w3"}]]], "4p1z7f": ["What are good, affordable Vegan food (not even fish or milk from any animal)?", "2016-06-21 04:49:28", 3, "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/4p1z7f/what_are_good_affordable_vegan_food_not_even_fish/", [[6, "Legumes are excellent, and can be really cheap if you get them at the right place (I get mine from Indian grocery stores, but your mileage may very depending on where you live). \n\nAnother thing is TVP mince.

Prefer to cook at home together vs go to dinner. Would rather get a bottle of wine and sit by the fire or watch a movie at home vs go out to a bar. Hike with the dog instead of go to various events. We don't get a Starbucks coffee every day or anything like that.

Bottled water & gum at the gas station, going out to eat every single Friday because we were too lazy to cook after working all week, random trips to the mall to kill time, impulse buys at the register, etc. it adds up so fast without you even realizing it. "], [13, "I'm a teacher in Los Angeles, and I apparently made over $80K last year (before taxes, which are high in CA) because I taught an extra class. I pay very high rent ($1800) but low utilities ($50~). My car is 12 and I bought it 2nd hand from a friend, so that was easy. I've had to put some money into it, but I had some saved.\n\nI have a lot of freebies, though. My sister has me on her family phone plan, so I have an old black flip-phone that I use for the occasional text or phone call, and it costs me nothing. Costs my sister about $10 a month (she told me that, at least.)\n\nMy landlady lets me log onto her internet for free (we share a duplex.) My laptop is issued by the school. So I'm paying nothing for phone/internet. \n\nMy insurance is a little high because I have to commute the L.A. freeways to work and back, so that and gas\u2026 yeah.\n\nThen there is my student loan. I was in a Ph.D. program, dropped out after 3 years, and when I began working I was about 76K in debt. I've been hacking away at it, though, and am down to 42K.\n\nI think my biggest areas of expenditure, back in the day, was food & drink. I used to go out with my friends a lot, and West Hollywood is very, very expensive. And I bought a lot of deli food because I'm not much of a cook either. Meat and dairy really add up, as do those pre-packaged salads. And as you mentioned, coffee. And alcohol. And chocolate. And pet food and care (cats.)\n\nSo lately I've been experimenting. I've gone on a vegan diet, am living on fruits, veggies, rice, pasta, oatmeal, and beans. Lots of beans. It is fortunate that I absolutely love these things. But no sweets, no desserts, no dairy, no meat\u2026 and my grocery bill has dropped to about a quarter of what it was. I make big pots of bean soup on the weekends and tupperware them up in the fridge. Then I make the rice separately and do the same. That's what I take to school for lunch. Breakfast is just apples. Seriously, I eat two apples for breakfast and they hold me for about 4 hours. Beans and rice for lunch. Fruit again at 3pm when my students leave (I do have a kumquat tree in the backyard, so that's free.) Then I come home and boil some potatoes, or pasta, or steam some veggies. Nothing fancy. My tastebuds are pretty undeveloped, and I'm glad of it.\n\nOccasionally I still go out with my friends, but now I'm learning not to order alcohol or large meals. I'm sure the waiters hate me because I'm ordering herbal tea and a side dish, but I try to make up for it a little in the tip. \n\nI'm doing this partly because I am determined to pay off that student loan in the next 3 years, and retire at 55. It's also a health experiment (and I have lost weight.) This helps me psychologically to not feel sorry for myself over any treat I deprive myself of: it's an experiment. I can stop any time if I want to and go back to spending all my income on pleasures, paying only the minimum on the loan, and having no savings. I just have found I prefer not to. So far.

I pay very high rent ($1800) but low utilities ($50~). My car is 12 and I bought it 2nd hand from a friend, so that was easy. I've had to put some money into it, but I had some saved.\n\nI have a lot of freebies, though. My sister has me on her family phone plan, so I have an old black flip-phone that I use for the occasional text or phone call, and it costs me nothing. Costs my sister about $10 a month (she told me that, at least.)\n\nMy landlady lets me log onto her internet for free (we share a duplex.) My laptop is issued by the school. So I'm paying nothing for phone/internet. \n\nMy insurance is a little high because I have to commute the L.A. freeways to work and back, so that and gas\u2026 yeah.\n\nThen there is my student loan. I was in a Ph.D. program, dropped out after 3 years, and when I began working I was about 76K in debt. I've been hacking away at it, though, and am down to 42K.\n\nI think my biggest areas of expenditure, back in the day, was food & drink. I used to go out with my friends a lot, and West Hollywood is very, very expensive. And I bought a lot of deli food because I'm not much of a cook either. Meat and dairy really add up, as do those pre-packaged salads. And as you mentioned, coffee. And alcohol. And chocolate. And pet food and care (cats.)\n\nSo lately I've been experimenting. I've gone on a vegan diet, am living on fruits, veggies, rice, pasta, oatmeal, and beans. Lots of beans. It is fortunate that I absolutely love these things. But no sweets, no desserts, no dairy, no meat\u2026 and my grocery bill has dropped to about a quarter of what it was. I make big pots of bean soup on the weekends and tupperware them up in the fridge. Then I make the rice separately and do the same. That's what I take to school for lunch. Breakfast is just apples. Seriously, I eat two apples for breakfast and they hold me for about 4 hours. Beans and rice for lunch. Fruit again at 3pm when my students leave (I do have a kumquat tree in the backyard, so that's free.) Then I come home and boil some potatoes, or pasta, or steam some veggies. Nothing fancy. My tastebuds are pretty undeveloped, and I'm glad of it.\n\nOccasionally I still go out with my friends, but now I'm learning not to order alcohol or large meals. I'm sure the waiters hate me because I'm ordering herbal tea and a side dish, but I try to make up for it a little in the tip. \n\nI'm doing this partly because I am determined to pay off that student loan in the next 3 years, and retire at 55. It's also a health experiment (and I have lost weight.) This helps me psychologically to not feel sorry for myself over any treat I deprive myself of: it's an experiment.

This results in butyric acid being released thanks to lipolysis. Butyric acid is the thing that makes things like vomit, sweat and rancid butter smell/taste like they do. So yeah, enjoy that in your chocolate. Because of Hershey's popularity, other US manufacturers started using this process, and most American chocolate is thus completely disgusting.

My 2012 Prius C prices at around $12000 as well.  The engine and transmission have quite a good reputation, but it's gonna need lube, filters, and ... well, that's it for the first ten years.

The last time you applied for a job, they did quote your salary \"after taxes\".  Of course not.  It's also inaccurate as so many different things can potentially effect your tax rate (including total income, deductions, location, etc).  It almost seems like they picked a location with exceptional high taxation to make their point.  At the same time, they \"conveniently\" left out potential tax deductions that you could make if you are using the car for business purposes.\n\n* The 54 cents per mile cost estimate is totally bogus unless you are driving a very expensive vehicle.   Not to mention that most people already have the vehicle for personal use so it's not like the average user goes and buys a brand new $40k car and just uses it exclusively to drive for uber.  Things like insurance are already fixed costs for most uber drivers regardless of whether they drive for uber 200 hours a month or 10 minutes.\n\nI'm not saying you are going to get rich off of driving for uber.
