I know hauntings have to start somewhere, but they usually involve something happening IN the house.\n\nI think the spirit or spirits fixated on Carol-anne's youthful lifeforce as she was the youngest in the house. They refer to this multiple times in the movie.\n\nHauntings don't usually involve physical interactions with people or objects.\n\n\nAnyway, like I said, it makes a little more sense if you watch the second movie.. rather than it just being a bunch of pissed off townsfolk who had their graves desecrated. :)", "id": "d1ucpa3"}, {"comment": "Wow, this post confused the hell out of me until I realized I misread \"gravesite\" as \"transvestite\".", "id": "d1tr6qk"}, {"comment": "Lessons learned from Are You Afraid of the Dark.

It was her first time so I left her alone, stopped feeding, went out of the barn, and didn't return for part of the morning.

They were angora bunnies and all the babies survived to adulthood, so they just ended up going to pet homes where they could happily live earless lives.  I'd paid quite a bit for this doe and was still trying to get a couple decent babies from her, then retire her to my old does barn,  so I figured I would give her a rest and breed her the next year.  When she had her next litter, I came out to headless and legless babies.  I was so upset with her, but I felt maybe it was something I did?  Next time I moved her into the garage, where she could be alone and in quiet for her pregnancy.  I gave her veggies and fruits too because I wondered if she had been deficient in something.  Well, month passes and she has more babies...I come out to find only three legs stuffed in her food dish.  I looked at her, she looked at me.\n\nThe rabbit stew was great that night, especially with all the leftover vegetables.", "id": "cz8ndf9"}, {"comment": "Mmmmm....

", "id": "d2uf42t"}, {"comment": "I know a few artists and spoken with more. Seems the number one advice the older artists have for younger artists is to charge more.\n\nYour current pricing puts you in line with costume jewelry, so you'll always be competing against that. Charging more changes the market you are competing against. \n\nEtsy is obviously full of the cheaper options, but take a look at your numbers and see if it's sustainable.\n\nOf course, art is also weird. You never know what is going to sell at what price. One painter I knew used to always say \"It's not art until it sells \u2013 it's just a storage problem\". \n\nTake a look at various local art galleries and anywhere else people are selling. Check their prices out and figure out how you want to fit in. Remember, you're pricing these to sell to people who are emotionally impacted by the pieces and they're paying for that. \n\nIt also helps to network with artists to find out what pricing strategies are working for them. Seems that several artists have found ways to do both. Charge a bunch for the original, but charge less for photos/cards/prints of it. \n\nIn your case, I could easily see some beautiful black and white photos of the mummies selling pretty well.\n\nYou'll hear tons of people say \"I could do that\" for any art style (maybe less on the piggy fetuses). These are not people you want to sell to. They will always ask for it cheaper (and likely free for the exposure). \n\nThe people you want to talk to are the true fans.

I always liked art, and really had no interests in other things as much as I did with art. Everything I created was so scattered.

Then I'd look at my paintings and drawings and just stare disappointed. Everything laid out in front of me could have been done by anyone. I was painting for up to 8 hours everyday trying to find myself. I burnt myself out. I lost inspiration. \nWhen I was 17, I stumbled across something that I normally wouldn't pay any attention to, a dead cicada. They are an animal, kind of, and I'm an animal lover. Cicadas were no exclusion to that. Alive, they have always intrigued me, and I'd hold them in my hands in admiration. Dead, not so much. Even though this one cicada was dead, I picked it up carefully by the wings. It had sat there so long in the dry summer's heat that the wings just fell off. I was mortified, but still clutched the wings. It was much easier to examine them this way. Nature has always been inspiring to me, and it was incredible that nature could create something so small, beautiful, and delicate. I didn't want to see those wings go to waste, so I kept them. \n\nAbout a month went by before I stumbled across them again in my room, and it hit me. They were the absolute perfect size for a fairy. That's where it all began. I had finally discovered what I was meant to do. I was using nature as my canvas now and adding magickal touches to anything that I found interesting like, insect wings, bones, and even crystals.

I'm not gonna devote an hour to this comment, but right off the bat in the movement test the way she tilts and moves her head when looking forward is reminicent of predators that have forward facing eyes -owls for example-.

This sub used to having quality posts with weird, creepy, scary, unique, mysterious, etc., etc. stuff in it, but as soon as it became a default, the quality just dropped. This makes sense. Before, the only people who found the subreddit were people *actively seeking* creepy content. Now, the people who find the subreddit are people *who happen to log in to Reddit.* They may see a post and think it is creepy, maybe avoiding some of the creepier stuff, as they're not as used to creepy stuff to begin with, then post something that they find creepy, and maybe many, *many* other people find it creepy, but I personally believe that isn't the basis of the subreddit. It isn't a \"here's what I find creepy\" sub. It is a \"here's stuff that will creep you out\" sub. What I have a problem with is that people post pictures of things that are either startling or what I call \"two-step\" creepy. That is to say, the viewer has to do the work. Example: \"I nearly shat myself when I walked in and saw this.\" Cue a pic of some lump of laundry that looks like a person in a chair. Ok. So now I, the viewer, have to look at the pic, see the lump, realize it is vaguely human-shaped, and think, \"hmm, yeah, it would be startling to see that when not expecting it.\" If it gave you a start, it wasn't creepy. It startled you. That's why there's another word for it. The two-step creepy is like that damned pic of the Clown motel. Nothing about that is creepy. I have to again do the work and think, \"oh, I guess if I were afraid of clowns, the thought of a motel run by clowns would be creepy,\" even though a simple sign which reads \"clown motel\" is not at all creepy in its own right. \n\nWe are inundated with dolls, clowns, and childhood spooks, but I'm OK with most of those, as some people find them creepy. I'm not fine with the piss-poor content that is only creepy once you actually try to dive into it, or isn't creepy at all, but relating a message of \"this scared me.\" \n\nRegardless, once the sub became a default, it turned into a sub I'd visit nearly daily for some creepy content to a sub I visit once a month, if that, to see if at least a few creepy posts have been made since I last came here.

This sub is going to be whatever the users make it. People will continue to bitch about posts not being creepy instead of finding content that is creepy and posting it. Most of the stuff that gets posted here are reposts or content linked from other subs.", "id": "d11nm7q"}, {"comment": "I think a lot of people figure, why bother adding content when everyone bitches about everything any way?\n\nI mean, we all know that upvotes are just imaginary internet points... But why waste time posting when you're pretty sure it's going to get ignored or downvoted or bitched about?\n", "id": "d12rz8y"}], [{"comment": "on a slightly unrelated note: does anyone have the link or screenshots to the creepy potato which had a shitton of upvotes and was on /r/creepy frontpage?

This sub used to having quality posts with weird, creepy, scary, unique, mysterious, etc., etc. stuff in it, but as soon as it became a default, the quality just dropped. This makes sense. Before, the only people who found the subreddit were people *actively seeking* creepy content. Now, the people who find the subreddit are people *who happen to log in to Reddit.* They may see a post and think it is creepy, maybe avoiding some of the creepier stuff, as they're not as used to creepy stuff to begin with, then post something that they find creepy, and maybe many, *many* other people find it creepy, but I personally believe that isn't the basis of the subreddit. It isn't a \"here's what I find creepy\" sub. It is a \"here's stuff that will creep you out\" sub. What I have a problem with is that people post pictures of things that are either startling or what I call \"two-step\" creepy. That is to say, the viewer has to do the work. Example: \"I nearly shat myself when I walked in and saw this.\" Cue a pic of some lump of laundry that looks like a person in a chair. Ok. So now I, the viewer, have to look at the pic, see the lump, realize it is vaguely human-shaped, and think, \"hmm, yeah, it would be startling to see that when not expecting it.\" If it gave you a start, it wasn't creepy. It startled you. That's why there's another word for it. The two-step creepy is like that damned pic of the Clown motel. Nothing about that is creepy. I have to again do the work and think, \"oh, I guess if I were afraid of clowns, the thought of a motel run by clowns would be creepy,\" even though a simple sign which reads \"clown motel\" is not at all creepy in its own right. \n\nWe are inundated with dolls, clowns, and childhood spooks, but I'm OK with most of those, as some people find them creepy. I'm not fine with the piss-poor content that is only creepy once you actually try to dive into it, or isn't creepy at all, but relating a message of \"this scared me.\" \n\nRegardless, once the sub became a default, it turned into a sub I'd visit nearly daily for some creepy content to a sub I visit once a month, if that, to see if at least a few creepy posts have been made since I last came here.

Creepiest experience I ever had was about 4 years ago at roughly about 2am (an old friend and I were making awful exploration videos and wanted to go at night to get a feel for the place) now we've been in daylight plenty but God it was terrifying in darkness. An old Irish cabin in the woods off the side of a road  \n\nAnyhow what happened was we entered the building looked around and took our time and shit ourselves at every little Creek as 14 year olds would. Into the main room in the back, main room as it had a fire place and a few other bits we took a few photos and what not and then, until this day we don't know if it was paranoia or reality but we both heard what sounded like footsteps in the house. This whole situation came upon me so quickly and I'm awful with stress i panicked big time. we ended up climbing out the window and hiding up against the wall for about 30 minutes until we couldn't hear anything but cars passing by. Never saw or hear anyone again there. \n\nOnly other experience with people is a big jeep pulling up outside a building and a man getting out with a flashlight and then leaving. Not explored anywhere in years unfortunately something I'd love to get back into.

The door had been busted down so we went inside.\n\nI don't believe it was a house, but possibly a small church or some other type of larger building. It must have been at least 80-100 years old. Upstairs was dark and creepy but me and another guy decided to check out the basement. We go down these stairs with flashlights in hand and the basement is flooded about 4 feet high with murky black water. We scan around the room and about 30 feet from us across the water is what appears to be a bar table of some sort. It's higher than a regular table, probably a place someone would use a stool to sit at. Anyway, sitting all by itself on this table of this flooded room is beer bottle standing straight up. Like someone just left it sitting there. The building seemed completely unsafe to be in so we decided to leave, but I'll never forget that lone beer bottle just sitting there. I snapped a pick, but it came out kind of dark. I've never bothered to \"enhance\" it because I don't know how to use photo editing programs.
