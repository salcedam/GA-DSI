Me too thanks. This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English, most notably line, from the use of a linen (flax) thread to determine a straight line.\n\nTextiles in a linen weave texture, even when made of cotton, hemp and other non-flax fibers, are also loosely referred to as \"linen\".

Assuming Earth gravity (9.8m/s/s), the vertical distance fallen by the bullet as a function of time is given by s=4.9t^2.\n\nNow consider the average height of the adult male, 177cm (5'10\"). The gun will be fired from shoulder height, so we can estimate the perpendicular distance of the barrel above the ground by subtracting the height of the average adult male head, 23.9cm. This gives us an average displacement of 153cm above the ground.\n\nPutting this together tells us that 1.53 = 4.9t^2, and therefore t = 0.56 seconds. The bullet travels 2200 metres before touching the ground, and so speed = distance / time = 2200 / 0.56 which equals 3900 m/s, ignoring resistive forces.

Me too thanks. This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English, most notably line, from the use of a linen (flax) thread to determine a straight line.\n\nTextiles in a linen weave texture, even when made of cotton, hemp and other non-flax fibers, are also loosely referred to as \"linen\". Such fabrics generally also have their own specific names, for example fine cotton yarn in a linen-style weave is called Madapolam.\n\n", "id": "d9gyxk2"}], [{"comment": "safegaurd post, i like it. handy dandy", "id": "d9h00sf"}], [{"comment": "What has happened to my second favorite place?", "id": "d9h1suw"}], [{"comment": "it's a good dog Brent", "id": "d9h1xcj"}], [{"comment": "They're good immunity dogs Brent ", "id": "d9h328l"}], [{"comment": "You people are all fucking insane.

The franchise began with the film Stargate, released on October 28, 1994, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Carolco, which grossed US$197 million worldwide.[1][2] Me too thanks. In 1997, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner created a television series titled Stargate SG-1 as a sequel to the film. This show was joined by Stargate Atlantis in 2004, and a third spin-off series, Stargate Universe, in 2009. Also consistent with the same story are a variety of books, video games and comic books, as well as the direct-to-DVD movies Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Continuum, which concluded the first television show after 10 seasons.\n\nIn 2011, Stargate Universe, the last Stargate program on television, ended its run and the franchise has been in limbo since. Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions .[3] The predominant story arc thus ran for 17 years and includes 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming. However, a variety of other media either ignore this main story arc, or reset it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series Stargate Infinity, and a possible new film series once again directed by Roland Emmerich, announced as being under consideration in 2014.[4]"], [30, "Now this is an offer I can't pass up."], [27, "I can't believe this sub has been so stupid all month, talking about how there's no meme of the month but you've ALL missed the timbs/new york guy memes.

The franchise began with the film Stargate, released on October 28, 1994, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Carolco, which grossed US$197 million worldwide.[1][2] Me too thanks. In 1997, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner created a television series titled Stargate SG-1 as a sequel to the film. This show was joined by Stargate Atlantis in 2004, and a third spin-off series, Stargate Universe, in 2009. Also consistent with the same story are a variety of books, video games and comic books, as well as the direct-to-DVD movies Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Continuum, which concluded the first television show after 10 seasons.\n\nIn 2011, Stargate Universe, the last Stargate program on television, ended its run and the franchise has been in limbo since. Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions .[3] The predominant story arc thus ran for 17 years and includes 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming. However, a variety of other media either ignore this main story arc, or reset it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series Stargate Infinity, and a possible new film series once again directed by Roland Emmerich, announced as being under consideration in 2014.[4]", "id": "d9emila"}, {"comment": "Do not.

During sleep, your body is working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health. In children and teens, sleep also helps support growth and development.\n\nThe damage from sleep deficiency can occur in an instant (such as a car crash), or it can harm you over time.

While scores of other memes have threatened others who refused to upvote or 'updoot' the image, never before has anything resulted from not upvoting until now.\n\nDankologists are now working on a meme in which inaction will result in being able to sit comfortably; hopefully reverting the billions afflicted with no longer being able to sit comfortable.  \n\nOur reporters interviewed some so-called redditors who did upvote the image and one by the name of smart4301 had this to say, \"I know when I read an image saying 'you have been visited by' I know to immediately upvote lest risk some sort of affliction.

If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"doggo family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, which includes things from sub woofers to birdos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a pupper a doggo is because random people \"call the small yip yip ones doggos?\" Let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the doggo family. But that's not what you said. You said a pupper is a doggo, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the doggo family doggos, which means you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species doggos, too.

Consequently, in some areas the petty-bourgeois peasantry attempted to play an independent role by manoeuvring between the Bolsheviks and their counter-revolutionary enemies. Tendencies towards these sorts of actions were especially strong in Siberia and the Ukraine \u2013 both areas being less developed economically and industrially, and consequently having a strong and rich peasant class. For a time, these forces allied with the Bolsheviks, as the White Army stood for the restoration of the old landowner system, which was absolutely unacceptable for the mass of the peasantry.\n\nOf all the peasant movements which sought to play the middle-ground, the most famous was that led by Makhno in the Ukraine from 1918 to 1921. This military force was a typical peasant army, unchanged from the old Medieval-era structure \u2013 possessing both the strengths and weaknesses of that form. Makhno\u2019s militia began as a guerrilla force formed when Germany occupied the Ukraine in 1918. These guerrillas excelled in their own sphere of action, but couldn\u2019t stand firm against an extended clash with a regular army. While these guerrillas operated in their home areas, they could expect help from locals. But, when fighting away from their home villages, they lived by banditry and as a result lost support from most people.\n\nMakhno led a peasant movement, and so never had a strong base of support in any of the cities. Most of the workers who lived in areas of the Ukraine under Makhno\u2019s control sided either with the Bolsheviks or the Mensheviks. The following examples illustrate the attitude that Makhno had towards the working class. When railway and telegraph workers from the Ekaterinoslav-Sinelnikovo line were still suffering after a long period of starvation under Denikin\u2019s occupation, they asked Makhno to pay them for their work. He responded with, \u201cWe are not like the Bolsheviks to feed you, we don\u2019t need the railways; if you need money, take the bread from those who need your railways and telegraphs.\u201d In a separate incident, he told the workers of Briansk, \u201cBecause the workers do not want to support Makhno\u2019s movement and demand pay for the repairs of the armoured car, I will take this armoured car for free and pay nothing.\u201d (1) Jakovlev J.
