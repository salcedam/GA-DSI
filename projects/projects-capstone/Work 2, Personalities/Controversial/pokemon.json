(Along with Dragonite, Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Lapras.) Awarding Mystic, and *only* Mystic, double points for using it when it's already one of the best options is horribly imbalanced.\n\nArcanine (as Growlithe's evolution) is...okay, and honestly it's one of the best Fire types available right now, but it falters in the face of so much Water. Because again, Vaporeon. It does decently against Lapras since it only learns Ice moves in Go, but it's a small comfort.\n\nInstinct is completely shafted by this. Electric types are generally categorized by their high Speed stat, but the conversion formula in Go doesn't do a good job of taking Speed into account, so Electrode and Jolteon are complete shit. (If you use a Jolteon to attack a defending Vaporeon of equal level, the Jolteon will lose. It's that stupid.) Magneton and Electabuzz are also quite rare and while they have Gen 4 evolutions to make them more useful (assuming they keep the same stat formula between now and then), they still can't hold a candle to most other options.\n\nI'm saying this as a Team Mystic player. Please reconsider the list of Pokemon for each team to use."], [2, "Posted this earlier, but I'll post it here for visibility:  \nSay a player has time for a 10 gym run each day. If they're able to leave a slew of decent defenders (in this case, Vaporeon vs everything else on that list), some of those gyms have a much higher chance of lasting until that player's next gym run. So if they hold 3 gyms for 24 hrs, and then go on a run of 10, they'll be able to screen shot 13 gyms as long as they pass anywhere near the vicinity of the other 3 gyms. Meanwhile, the other teams will likely not have any gyms last a full day, and will only get 10.  \nOn top of this, none of these Pokemon are common gym defenders outside of Vaporeon, which means it's likely that many Mystic players already have Vapes locked in gyms for free points. I can almost guarantee you that few to no Instinct or Valor players had any of those Pokemon locked into defending gyms before the double points, and that's my biggest issue here: Mystic easily gets double points retroactively, while Instinct and Valor don't.  \nOne last point, it is **incredibly** resource intensive to continuously cycle these weaker Pokemon in and out of gyms.

The mystic might hold the gym for a longer time, but you both get 2 points for the Reddit contest.\n\nAnd guys, you don't need to take down the gym with the Pok\u00e9mon you're gonna put in. You valor and Instinct players can still use your OP Vaporeons (which I know you guys have one, who doesn't?) and then slide in a pretty bad Magmar or Magneton. ", "id": "d7qe0si"}, {"comment": "Vaporeon was a matter of accessibility. If we'd left the Eeveelutions out, the complaints would have been \"Instinct has easier Pokemon to catch\". Including Vaporeon is specifically why Lapras was excluded from the Mystic Pokemon. There's no \"perfect\" balance. Valor could make the same claim and say that \"Fire types are terrible gym defenders\", and they'd be 100% correct. As I stated in a post above, we're using the month as trial month to figure out what gimmicks \"work\" and what ones \"don't\" and are monitoring submissions and scores accordingly. We plan on having a survey at the end of the month as well to get some feedback for future contests.  \n  \nWhile it is true that Vaporeon is a marginally better gym defender than Jolteon and Flareon. Magnemite and Voltorb are significantly more common than Seel and Shelder (depending on your region).   \n  \nAlso just want to point out that in terms of Gym Defence, a good portion of the submissions we receive don't use the traditional gym defenders either because: those Pokemon are already guarding other gyms, or because the player is low on healing items. Furthermore, these submissions don't count towards a users 5 gym cap, so it's strategically not beneficial to want to hold a gym for longer than 24 hours if you want to cash in this weekend on double points.

(Along with Dragonite, Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Lapras.) Awarding Mystic, and *only* Mystic, double points for using it when it's already one of the best options is horribly imbalanced.\n\nArcanine (as Growlithe's evolution) is...okay, and honestly it's one of the best Fire types available right now, but it falters in the face of so much Water. Because again, Vaporeon. It does decently against Lapras since it only learns Ice moves in Go, but it's a small comfort.\n\nInstinct is completely shafted by this. Electric types are generally categorized by their high Speed stat, but the conversion formula in Go doesn't do a good job of taking Speed into account, so Electrode and Jolteon are complete shit. (If you use a Jolteon to attack a defending Vaporeon of equal level, the Jolteon will lose. It's that stupid.) Magneton and Electabuzz are also quite rare and while they have Gen 4 evolutions to make them more useful (assuming they keep the same stat formula between now and then), they still can't hold a candle to most other options.\n\nI'm saying this as a Team Mystic player. Please reconsider the list of Pokemon for each team to use.", "id": "d7qnj0j"}], [{"comment": "Posted this earlier, but I'll post it here for visibility:  \nSay a player has time for a 10 gym run each day. If they're able to leave a slew of decent defenders (in this case, Vaporeon vs everything else on that list), some of those gyms have a much higher chance of lasting until that player's next gym run. So if they hold 3 gyms for 24 hrs, and then go on a run of 10, they'll be able to screen shot 13 gyms as long as they pass anywhere near the vicinity of the other 3 gyms. Meanwhile, the other teams will likely not have any gyms last a full day, and will only get 10.  \nOn top of this, none of these Pokemon are common gym defenders outside of Vaporeon, which means it's likely that many Mystic players already have Vapes locked in gyms for free points. I can almost guarantee you that few to no Instinct or Valor players had any of those Pokemon locked into defending gyms before the double points, and that's my biggest issue here: Mystic easily gets double points retroactively, while Instinct and Valor don't.  \nOne last point, it is **incredibly** resource intensive to continuously cycle these weaker Pokemon in and out of gyms.

I feel like even though people are pissed at the league we'll still watch the episode, there will still be a discussion thread on thursday, ( probs by /u/jorgesnoopy ) and it'll still reach the sub's front page. \n\nPeople just need time to get over it, it was admittedly a pretty trollish outcome. They hyped up Ash's placing and made him seem pretty damn formidable, the formula was there too (lose to rival multiple times, beat them at the league), but when it mattered most they goofed up. I'm in the boat that hopes the league was rigged or Ash wasn't fighting at full strength or whatever.\n\nI think the league was a Lake Acuity esque set up for the real final match, which will take place during the TF arc. So i'm gonna tune in to see Ash wreck Alain's edgy ass. \n\nThere's still also the other characters. Everyone who really watched the entirety of XY knows that the writers made a ton of lovable characters. So if we're all mad at Ash and Alain, we're sure as hell gonna watch it for Serena, ***Clemont***, Bonnie, Sawyer, and Blaziken Man.", "id": "d6sj8c6"}, {"comment": "Don't understand how the the outcome was troll. Yes they did develop Ash-Greninja into something really strong, but they also developed Charizard into a super OP Pokemon.\n\nCharizard took on 9 other Mega trainers before fighting elite 4 Malva. Even though Alain used potions after each win, Charizard still had scratches and appeared tired before fighting Malva.\n\nCharizard went head-head with Steven's Mega Metagross. Charizard tanked multiple hits from Metagross then got bodied into a mountain which exploded. Charizard could still battle after all of that.\n\nCharizard took on 50% Zygarde and had the advantage which allowed Team Flare to immobilized it.\n\nCharizard tanked a dragons ascent from Mega Rayquaza. Charizard wasn't knocked out because it was still Mega'd after the hit unlike Primal Groudon and Kyogre who exited Primal form after getting hit.\n\nThe fact Charizard has literally never lost a single battle with the exception of Siebold's blastoise. After the lost they trained super hard progressing to beat 10 Mega Trainers in a roll.\n\nIf you look at the past results, Charizard is actually busted as fuck. Greninja on the other hand has never accomplish nearly as much as Charizard. Sure he went head-head with Diantha, but Ash-Greninja overdid it and became too exhausted. Greninja later lost to Abomasnow. Unless you are saying Abonasnow is stronger than Gardevoir.\n\nIf anything, Charizard was expected to win. I'm not saying the fight was good, just saying Charizard winning is fully justifiable. Should Charizard have been developed in such a way he looked super busted? No. But since he was developed in this way his win is fully justifiable.", "id": "d6skdkq"}, {"comment": "**TLDR:** Hyped up only to be disappointed in the end\n \n\nI know Alain's Charizard is strong as all hell but they've hyped Ash Greninja up for almost a year. It started with Olympia's prophecy \"you'll reach heights never before seen\"\n\nAnd then the first synchro episode where they tell the story of an ancient Greninja with a powerful form. \n\nAfter a while he meets Alain himself who is in awe with the power and decides to battle them. IIRC he called it mega evolving without the use of stones, and said it was a testament to their powerful bond (I might have just heard that from somewhere else)\n\nFew episodes later he drives the Champion's Mega-Gardevoir into a corner until he passes out from exhuastion. That's pretty damn impressive considering regular trainers have a hard time even fazing the main Pokemon of a Champion (Cynthia vs Paul, Alder vs Trip, Steven vs Alain)\n\nThen comes his second battle with Alain. They manage to almost blitz Zard X while Greninja was at half power, that is until Ash passes out from exhaustion again.\n\nNow Ash goes on a small losing streak, and that isn't the fault of Greninja (he's not weak or anything), it's because Ash became obsessed with winning he forgot about strategizing properly and working with Greninja. All he did was call out moves and try to overwhelm opponents with synchro.\n\nIn the Snowbelle city arc he went alone to reflect on his losses and relearned the reason he went on his journey in the first place. His love for Pokemon. Him and Greninja decided to start over together and they mastered the form (being able to use it at will). Damn, character development for Ash Ketchum? color me impressed.\n\n---\n\nNow all of the promotional videos and previews hyped up the league and a super powerful new water shuriken was teased. From episode titles and scans revealed we knew Ash was to make it to the finals and his opponent is none other than Alain. From the write up I gave above it would seem as though Ash would finally conquer that wall right?\n\nThe day has finally come, Pikachu obliterated two pseudo legends and managed to score some hits on Charizard even. It seems like it really wants to win this as much as Ash does so it's trying to make it so that Greninja doesn't have to come out and take any damage until it's absolutely necessary.\n\nEpisode 38, we all fore saw Charizard eventually dealing with Pikachu, but not after taking damage. Then comes Goodra vs Bisharp. Didn't Ash promise Goodra they'd win together or some shit like that? Too bad, you just got KO'd by Guillotine that is fucking spammable and has no drawbacks whatsoever. It's ok, we've still got Greninja right. Takes out Bisharp GG ez. \n\nLoses to 2x Dragon Claw and Blast Burn. That's it? That's all? \n\n\nDo you see where i'm coming from.", "id": "d6slb31"}, {"comment": "Ash-Greninja was overhyped. Either they don't hype it as much or they don't develop Charizard into a super OP Pokemon. Like I stated before, he has a lot of notable accomplishments that heavily outshine what Greninja was able to accomplish. Pikachu took out 2 of Alain's filler Pokemon. Writers probably didn't want to put much into Alain's fillers and at the same time make Pikachu good.\n\nI've been saying this in a lot of posts, but blast burn is used as a finisher. Battle is dragging on for too long? Make Charizard use blast burn. It doesn't really matter how many hits Greninja tanks before getting hit by blast burn. The writers basically used it as a finisher for literally (with the except of Steven's Mega Metagross) every battle. Malva's Mega-Houndoom? Blast burn. Greninja? Blast burn what a surprise. It doesn't matter if Greninja is water and blast burn is fire, its used as a finisher. It KO'd Mega-Houndoom despite being 1/2 damage. If people really want to throw backlash at this fact, water shuriken KO'd Mega Sceptile which is 1/4 damage.\n\nPikachu also should not even scratch Charizard if we take the example from Steven vs Alain. Even the 10 Mega Trainer challenge. Charizard had scratches and was tired before battling Malva.\n\nI'm not saying the fight was good. Just saying the win was justifiable and shouldn't be so shocking.\n\n**tl;dr** Greninja is overhyped. Charizard was developed into something that was beyond broken. Either tone down the hype or tone down the development of Charizard.", "id": "d6slqwx"}, {"comment": "I agree with this. People also claim that Ash losing to the Elite Four would have been fine, but we saw Alain's Charizard beat Malva's Mega Houndoom after facing several other megas with short breaks in between. If you're expecting Ash to lose to the Elite Four, how is Alain's Charizard supposed to lose to Ash-Greninja when it's been portrayed to be on the level of the Elite Four?\n\nAlain/Charizard and Ash/Greninja have a large gap in terms of strength and experience together. The outcome wasn't troll or bs. People are salty about Ash losing in the finals after they hyped it up. Be salty, but don't try and apply false logic to justify the anger.", "id": "d6smwi7"}, {"comment": "A lot of people bring up the point that Ash-Greninja gave Diantha's Mega Gardevoir and Charizard (2nd battle) a hard time. Fact is, in both those battles they overdid themselves too early and exhausted themselves. I think a good analogy to this would be like running. You can sprint at the beginning of a race, but you won't finish the marathon sprinting. That's exactly what Ash-Greninja did in both those fights. On top of that, Alain was able to keep up with Steven and Steven is also a champion. If Greninja beats Charizard, does that mean he can out pressure Steven's Metagross? Because Charizard was able to land some really clean hits onto Metagross.", "id": "d6sn8l5"}, {"comment": "BLAZIKEN MAN! Oh man, what happened to him?\n\nI'm excited for this Team Flare arc going forward. Something seems suspicious about Alain in the league episodes anyway. I think it is still possible that he'll be outed for his role with Team Flare, and Ash's runner-up title will end up holding more significance. Ash will still battle Diantha, and maybe that's the battle he'll win. There's a lot of fishy smells though, so I concur with OP that the league result could be some setup.\n\nIt will be fun to see Clemont and Xerosic go head to head, and to see what happens to Serena. As someone who has the history to verify a salty first reaction though, I must say that it's concerning to see such a trolling move done by the writers. I think a lot of amourshippers are on edge too, given rumors that Serena will be cut from the cast like many of the other female companions. If they troll once, they could troll again.\n\nMy main rebuttal to that though, is that they couldn't separate Ash and Misty for a fucking long time. And now, we have a new ship to beat it, one that is canon in both the Japanese original and English dub. But I digress.\n\nI think it's totally valid, for a lot of reasons, the 20th anniversary included, that people are salty about the league reaction. They had such a great setup for Ash to FINALLY win!

That bothered me, but then, she conquered her next goal like a badass, and it made me all the more invested in her growth.\n\nI was never a shipper either, but I don't understand why the writers of the anime would write in a canon crush on Ash just to pull the rug out from under everyone's feet. Was this supposed to be part of the French romanticism of Kalos, and just left there? I don't think so.

Also a loss for Alain would've added more depth for him in the next arc by putting him on the edge after his failure and Ash showing him the light again. That would have made their rubber match for this arc more interesting. But what I wanted most is to finally see Ash take on the E4 with his all time best team. Most of his Kalos pokemon could arguably fight at that level. Some got nerfed hard in the league. Just a full on pokemon battle. The fanservice I've needed from this series.

That's it.  No one has given any objective reason other than consistency. \n\nAnd the need to be consistent in this case is subjective, since it hasn't been consistent with the naming of games - with some having to use two letters (ORAS) and sometimes having three games (DPP). So sticking to the first initial of each word in the title really doesn't matter, not to mention the whole other region which some people may not even count from Colosseum/XD\n\nWhen you say \"ReBlGrYe\" or \"DiPePL\" out loud, what do they sound like?  When talking with friends do you really say \"FRLG\" or do you say \"Fire Red Leaf Green\".  SuMo can be said out loud without sounding completely silly.  No wether that matters to you or not is subjective.  \n\nThere seems to be an implication that the ONLY reason we are using SuMo is because of the whole S&M thing, and it's not true.  To some people, such as myself, SuMo just sounds better, despite how we did things for the past 20 years. \n\nWhich leads back to the whole point, why does it matter - why can you just use what you want - be it SuMo, S/M, SM, or S&M and others can use what they want.  Like i've said, are you really not going to understand what people mean if they use one over another?\n\nWe already have some variation now - you will see people say XY or X&Y, others will say R/B/Y, some just do RBY.  \n\nWould people feel better if the mods just took a poll and everyone voted what was going to be the official unoffical way to abbreviate it?

Honestly that would make everyone shut up about it. You are correct about it being consistent. There isn't another reason, there will never be another. That's how it always has been.

I personally do not care for SuMo, but I'll cast no aspersions on anyone who wants to use it.  I plan to keep typing \"S/M\" whenever I have cause to mention the games.  A vote would not change that plan.\n\nThat said, whenever anyone uses SuMo, I'll still know exactly what they mean, and when I use S/M others will know exactly what I mean.

Seriously though, either the Lucario from Smash bros is a giant, or the Mewtwo is a dwarf. Lucario is supposed to be 3'11\", and Mewtwo is supposed to be 6'3\", yet Mewtwo appears to be, like, 1 foot taller max. Pokemon should fit the vibe they give off.

Everything else is a derivative or supplementary. If Lucario is 5' in Smash bros that doesn't affect the matter that he is suppose to be 3'11\".

We are given various points in the games where a pokemon's size can be evaluated. The one coming to mind is in Ruby and Sapphire I remember a pair of fishers who want to know the size of shroomish and barboach. They make it obvious that variance exists, and it would show that 5'7\" as the size of Blastoise is likely an average of the height observed.

The Trials appear to be type-based, so Alolan Raticate couldn't technically be part of Gumshoos' trial unless it kept its Normal-type. \n\n- Alolan Rattata or Raticate were given a Normal-type to distinguish themselves from Alolan Meowth, which can also be encountered early in the game in urban areas. The new type combination gives people an incentive to use these Alolan forms. \n\n- Part Normal-type Pok\u00e9mon are often ordinary animals with small traces of their second type in their design. Bibarel is a beaver that lives in the water, Diggersby is a rabbit that lives underground, etc. Alolan Rattata and Raticate are ordinary rats that are more active at night.

Pok\u00e9mon has built a larger world and mythology over the generations. It's not just a simple case of a kid running around in a world of magical creatures anymore and I appreciate that. The generation 5 games featured antagonists whose goal was to liberate Pok\u00e9mon from humans because there existed those who would abuse Pok\u00e9mon and use them as a means to an end. Their leader was an orphan who had been manipulated by his fake father, raised around abused Pok\u00e9mon as he could speak to them. The story made one question the ethics of the Pok\u00e9mon world. This was followed by Generation 6, which further elaborated on corruption in the Pok\u00e9mon world and revealed that a long time ago there was a war where the life force of dead Pok\u00e9mon was used to power a highly destructive weapon as well as resurrect another.

Pok\u00e9mon, as revealed in Generation 4, are behind the creation of many things in the Pok\u00e9mon world because they are the truest lifeforms of the world: humans are suggested in Sinnoh mythos to have evolved from Pok\u00e9mo in much the same way all conventional Pok\u00e9mon evolved from the ancestral Pok\u00e9mon, Mew. The Sinnoh myths reveal that the universe itself was created by the Pok\u00e9mon Arceus, who has an unknown relationship to the Unown from Generation 2.\n\nThe legendary duo from Unova in Generation 5 are, contrary to what you may think, not behind any huge creations such as the formation of continents. Their story was that they were a singular dragon shared by twin brothers who ruled the Unova region a few thousand years ago, but these brothers fought over truth and ideals. As such, the dragon split into two, one representing truth ad the other ideals. They're not \"deities\" in this case and you get the interesting fact that their true combined original form is still a mystery.

Just to clear that up from the beginning of your post.\n\nPersonally, as someone who has played since their mother gave them Pokemon Red, I love the newer Pokemon and most of my favourites come from other gens. I feel each gen adds decent Pokemon and improves on the battle system to a point where I can't go back and play older gen games. I've also found many Pokemon I dismissed as pointless have actually been really fun to use in the game. There are always a few that are just gimmicky, they shouldn't get in the way of you discovering some other awesome Pokemon. They always do a Pikachu clone but I had a lot of fun using an Emolga. \n\nI'll give you your point about the legendaries. I personally want a story that doesn't revolve around them as the only gen I felt that did this right was Gen V. The Gen 2 games were intended to be sequels to the first games which is why they reference them so much but that doesn't make them better than other games. If you're wanting to get back into the main series and don't want to wait I recommend XY because they are designed to introduce people to the series as well as having a lot of Gen I Pokemon in it.

Some developments, like the split of Special in Sp. Attack and Sp. Defense in Gen II, and the classification of moves as Physical or Special in Gen IV are so glaringly obvious that it's almost puzzling how they weren't done sooner. The fact that Pok\u00e9mon is as nuanced and competitive an e-sport as any other game can attest to that.\n\nMy issues with Gen III and the cursory pieces of information I'd get from subsequent games had more to do with design and \"feel\" than anything. I looked at the covers of Diamond and Pearl when they came out, and the monsters on the covers flat-out did not look like Pok\u00e9mon to me. It only got worse when I found out there were both Dragons and were the creators of time and space - that was just way over-the-top. I will admit to just dismissing the whole games outright on that basis, and it wasn't until years later that I actually found some of the additions really cool, like an evolution for the Magmar line that actually made me appreciate it (always thought Magmar and Magby looked like they had untreated tumors in their heads and thus they were my least-liked Fire-types).\n\nThe callbacks in Gen II don't make them better games mechanically, but it made for an experience that was organic and continuous with what I loved, instead of the \"reboot/remake\" vibe I got from Ruby. It's not that there's no room for innovation, but if a game was going to be Pok\u00e9mon, I expected it to be an extension of what I knew to be Pok\u00e9mon.", "id": "d7hn4l2"}, {"comment": "Pokemon definitely fell victim to spectacle creep, where each Legendary had to be more powerful than the last, and the stakes are raised exponentially with each subsequent release.

Pok\u00e9mon has built a larger world and mythology over the generations. It's not just a simple case of a kid running around in a world of magical creatures anymore and I appreciate that. The generation 5 games featured antagonists whose goal was to liberate Pok\u00e9mon from humans because there existed those who would abuse Pok\u00e9mon and use them as a means to an end. Their leader was an orphan who had been manipulated by his fake father, raised around abused Pok\u00e9mon as he could speak to them. The story made one question the ethics of the Pok\u00e9mon world.

I could see the Pok\u00e9mon world as an analogue to our own, except where these creatures played a central role. They were basically the animals of that world, and they could be studied and discovered in their natural habitats, and their origins were mysterious but grounded in nature. The deity-like Legendaries made the Pok\u00e9mon world that much removed from the real one, and more similar to a completely fantasy setting like Middle-earth.\n\nIt's a similar case with the storylines, with the \"epic\" elements serving to reduce the wish-fulfilment factor in favor of heavier drama and stakes.

I have had people bully me, and go out of their way to mock me... As recent as about six months ago (in college). This isn't because they're a \"casual player,\" or because I'm being elitist. It's because these people are insecure, and toxic. They despise people liking things that are unpopular because they themselves are insecure. Now they *seem* to like it, because it's popular. However, if Pokemon Go did not take off as well as it did, they likely would be harassing other players. \n\nThis all said, having some bitterness towards bullies from 10+ years ago may not be well founded.

Dark type was added to balance out Psychic's strengths early on. Steel serves as basically a tank-type, resisting a great many types but being weak to more common ones (Flamethrower, Earthquake, and various Fighting moves are usually not that hard to come by). Fairy gave Dragon another weakness and encouraged the use of Steel and Poison offensively. Where exactly would Light fit into the type relationships?\n\nThe best I can think of is make Ice and Grass resist it (since ice reflects/retracts light and plants absorb it) so they aren't as bad defensively. But then you run into the problem of there most likely not being many Light moves. Some move types could be changed around, but that presents a new problem of \"what can be classified as Light and what is classified as Light, but changed to X\". That leaves GF to create new Light moves - which they could do, but there probably wouldn't be too many.

Gen V was great to get me interested in Pok\u00e9mon again, with the idea of a region without old faces being very very exciting. It was like playing Red and Blue again in the best possible sense. B2W2 too were pretty great even if I enjoyed the first pair more, but it was fun to see another region after Kanto and Orre getting the 'X years later' treatment.\n\nFor me Gen VI, while enjoyable, was terribly lackluster, too interested in forcing the past than really moving the series forward. Did Santalune Forest really need to be an almost exact remake of Viridian Forest? Did Sycamore really have to give you a second, Kanto starter? And most importantly, did Charizard REALLY need two Mega Evolutions?\n\nGen V created a sense of nostalgia via clever allusions (the endgame of Team Plasma in BW is a fantastic call back to the ending part of Red and Blue in a way that it's not obvious on surface) while also breaking the formula in small but fun ways, while Gen VI seemed like it just wanted to copy the past rather than alluding to it.\n\nEven the interesting bits of lore we got about Kalos were never capitalized on, AZ had potential but we literally meet him three times and that's it. Yes, his story is sad, but there's barely anything of him outside of his sob story, especially when compared to N that was a constant presence on your journey (and I'm pretty sure that by name alone AZ was meant to emulate him). Team Flare also seemed far too goofy early on to take seriously and then got far too dark too suddenly, and while I like Lysandre I think the way he was written in the game botched the 'fallen hero' angle, not to mention trying to make him sympathetic doesn't work much when he's despicable enough to be hated but not too obviously far gone to make it work. That's not even getting in how the four members of the Vaniville gang are really underdeveloped, even the rival being pretty lame compared to its predecessors (especially since Cheren underwent a similar character arc, only better and had a point instead of awkwardly going through the motions of the plot).\n\nOmega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were much better games overall, both compared to their originals and XY, but they still were far from perfect and some of the features that weren't carried over from Emerald (like the friggin' Battle Frontier) seriously bummed me out more than it should.

However, these points cannot be earned - pokemon are born with them. IVs range from 0-31. They are inherited, to some extent (increased by items), from the parent pokemon.

IV breeding can be somewhat time consuming and frustrating, but once you get yourself a 6IV ditto and you get used to the process it gets a lot quicker. There is a NPC that gives you an idea of what your pokemon's IVs are, located in the pokecenter of the battle resort in ORAS and the Kiloude City Pok\u00e9mon Center in XY.

Some natures do nothing at all.\n\nYour team should also have proper balancing of physical and special attackers. Pokemon also need to have optimal movesets to fit with their role. A pokemon's role is how you play it, whether you use it as a \"tank\", a \"sweeper\", or as a number of other roles.

There's a theory that all Grass starters are based on extinct Animals, all Fire starters are based on the zodiac and all Water staters are based on Animals that need both land and water to survive.\n\nWhereas the Water starter thing is still true, the Fire and Grass theories are a bit dubious.\n\nFirst of all, Venusaur is a Dicynodont, hence it being a Reptile, yet still having ears like a Mammal, as Dicynodonts were a family of creatures called Synapsids that split off from Reptiles very early, and eventually evolved into Mammals. Most non Mammal Synapsids disappeared in the Jurassic. Then there's Meganium, which is straight up a Dinosaur. Speaking of Dinosaurs, Sceptile is a Dilophosaurus. In fact, Torterra is also a Dinosaur, specifically a Nodosaurid. Chesnaught is based on a Glyptodon, which was a kind of car sized Armadillo that was wiped out by early Humans.\n\nWhere's Serperior, you're probably asking? Well, other than the losing it's hind legs thing, there's nothing connecting it to a prehistoric Animal. The closest Animal to Serperior in real life is a Vine Snake, which also has the same pointed and upturned snout and green body.\n\nBut possibly the faultiest one is Fire Types = The Zodiac. Charizard is the Dragon, Blaziken is the Rooster, Infernape is the Monkey, Emboar is the Pig and Incineroar is the Tiger.\n\nHowever, Delphox is a Fox, not a Dog, but it could be argued that Delphox counts as Foxes are Canids, therefor part of the Dog family.\n\nThat just leaves Typhlosion, which doesn't match *any* Animal in the Zodiac. Many argue that Cyndaquil counts as it's a small Animal and it's description describes it as a 'Mouse', but not only would that bring up the problem of Mouse and Rat being different in the same way Fox and Dog are, but Nintendo seems to be fond of slapping 'Mouse' into the description of any small Mammalian Pok\u00e9mon such as Sandshrew (A Pangolin), Watchog (A Marmot) and Cyndaquil (An Echidna). To make things worse, Cyndaquil evolves into Quilava (A Weasel), which then evolves into Typhlosion (A Honey Badger). In fact, Badgers are more closely related to Foxes then they are to Rats.\n\nOf course Stilt Owls are an extinct Animal from Hawaii, but Animal location doesn't seem to match Pok\u00e9mon starters. Even the other Alola starters don't match, with Incineroar being a Tiger, an Asian Big Cat species, and Primarina being a Sea Lion, which are native to Japan, California and Australia. In fact, Primarina is based on a Selkie, a Mermaid like creature with the tail of a Seal rather than a Fish, which is from Scotland.", "id": "d9drbc0"}], [{"comment": "I just wish we got a Grass/Flying.

I only caught the tail end of her saying the Pokemon Center couldn't tell me about it. And then I started to panic when I checked my Pokemon and saw some of them had that \"status/Pokerus\" that wouldn't go away no matter how many times I tried healing them (full heals didn't work either, the horror!)\n\nI checked my strategy guide, and found nothing helpful. I remember I saved and closed the game for the day, and was scared the next day at school that my game had a virus (simpler times when *Pokemon* was my only worry of the day). When I came back I saw my Pokemon had a nice little dot instead. I finally left the Pokemon Center and get a call from Elm saying what it was and that I shouldn't worry about it.\n\nIt was only years later I realized I completely wasted the chance to spread Pokerus to my other Pokemon.

It has consistently been run by our Discord channel of 3000 users on an almost regular basis as that is the only effective way we could get regular, live and FAST feedback. I didn't design the CSS style, a former moderator did. I took over the task of finishing it within the last 6 months (along with a massive amount of help from our two new CSS moderators). This CSS update (despite many people requesting we revert to the old one) was absolutely necessary for the functionality of the subreddit. Reddit as you may or may not know has a 100kb cap on their CSS that affects every customizable feature of the subreddit from its aesthetics to its flairs. Because of the nature of our subreddit we have 800~ flairs, and unfortunately we can't remove any of them without gaining complaints. We still get complaints that we don't have a Cherrim Sun Form flair despite the fact there are like 10 users who use the regular Cherrim flair. Removing flairs therefore is not an option.\n\nThe CSS redesign was necessary so that we could gain back at little space in our code, while also being able to add future features, like oh let\u2019s say, the Alola Pokedex Flairs. The CSS itself was designed also with another notorious complaint we have received over the last 4 years - our lack of an effective night mode. We didn't want to implement a day mode at first because it would use up some of the precious limited space we'd spent so much effort trying to earn back for future features. When we saw you were displeased with the dark background, we tried our best to implement a low resource day mode that would allow those who were displeased to have what they wanted, while also maintaining a functioning nightmode. Unfortunately, when we switch the two around, it breaks the nightmode by adding features from the day mode because it is default. Fixing these issues will further use up that precious space we've tried to gain back. When the day mode is not the default these issues are barely noticeable because it's a few black/grey bits layers on white, whereas the opposite is blinding white against an all-black layout.\n\nWe held a vote with all of these issues in mind to get a fast reply so we could figure out what to do in regards to this because we didn't want to keep flipping back and forth between the two, causing further confusion. Frankly, the white mode is horrifyingly bright because, as you guessed it, it wasn't intended as anything more than a bonus feature to appease those who were unhappy. What furthered this was during the initial release ANY COMMENT that had anything positive to say was downvoted into oblivion almost instantly. Thanks to being moderators we are able to see vote manipulation. It takes users time to see registered votes, where as we see them instantly. When a comment appears and within seconds it has -5 or -10 votes, it's clear that someone has used multiple accounts to downvote it. That my friends is brigading and is against Reddit\u2019s TOS. Over the past few days we've been accused of manipulating this vote, however the sad reality is, it's been manipulated regardless.\n\nDuring all of this, we have done our best to remain both professional, and courteous to our users, despite the wild conspiracy theories, accusations and downright offensive comments that you've slung our way - all over something we did for you. Frankly, I feel like I've wasted my time. I could have easily applied this effort toward my own personal projects (and after the absolute ungrateful and downright offensive comments I've had inboxed to me, I kind of wish I had).\n\nThis has also been probably the worst way to welcome to moderators to our subreddit. You guys have absolutely made us look like a toxic environment who can't handle when they can't have their way about every little detail. I used to boast about how we were the least toxic, most professional gaming community but after seeing half of the removed comments on the past two threads, there's no doubt in my mind I've been deluding myself. As a moderator, I've yet to issue a single ban in the last 6 months, because that's not the type of person I am. Anyone who\u2019s ever had any interaction with me on this subreddit knows that I'm always willing to listen, and try and come to some mutually beneficial solution. I'm done doing that.\n\nIf I had my way right now, we'd have a CSS-less subreddit. I had 2 future projects planned for the subreddit, one involving Pokemon GO and the other involving reviewing /r/Pokemon Draws the Dex (for the Alola Region) - however I have absolutely no interest in that going forward. Over the past two days I've had my inbox flooded with comments ranging to \"If you think this CSS is good, you should kill yourself\" to \"Whoever designed this should step down as a moderator\", and I've still yet to issue a single ban. We've never censored any of your disagreeing comments and yet we are still being treated like we're trying to force our way. We held a vote, in what might not have been the most ideal way, but we held it as such so that we could move past this because it was starting to affect our relationship with the users. We've edited our rules for much the same reason.\n\nGoing forward, I don't really care what the subreddit looks like. I've opted to take a month long vacation from this place because I honestly can't stand to be here anymore. In 24 hours you've shown me the ugliest side of this community, and frankly I hope it isn't like this when I choose to return. This will likely put additional strain on our remaining moderators, and for that I apologize. I offer this explanation in effort to give some level of transparency between the moderation team and the users because this has got to end, now. Frankly, I'll likely be turning off the CSS going forward because something I painstaking worked on now upsets me to look at, so I don't care which side wins this vote. I'd like to apologize formally to all the people who subreddit requests for this CSS to meet there needs. I'm sorry an effective dark mode will likely not be possible if day mode remains default. I apologize that we likely won't have space for flairs beyond the next day unless we scrap the soon to be broken dark mode.\n\nI apologize that I even bothered taking any initiative to change the subreddit in any way beyond its decrepit 2007 CSS - that won't happen again. When I return to moderating I'll strictly be handling post reviews. All I ask is that you stop inboxing me, as I'm going to spend the next month enjoy the other part of reddit.\n\nThank you,\n\nTechnophonix"], [344, "When exactly was this poll and how come it wasn't up for longer?

It has consistently been run by our Discord channel of 3000 users on an almost regular basis as that is the only effective way we could get regular, live and FAST feedback. I didn't design the CSS style, a former moderator did. I took over the task of finishing it within the last 6 months (along with a massive amount of help from our two new CSS moderators). This CSS update (despite many people requesting we revert to the old one) was absolutely necessary for the functionality of the subreddit. Reddit as you may or may not know has a 100kb cap on their CSS that affects every customizable feature of the subreddit from its aesthetics to its flairs. Because of the nature of our subreddit we have 800~ flairs, and unfortunately we can't remove any of them without gaining complaints. We still get complaints that we don't have a Cherrim Sun Form flair despite the fact there are like 10 users who use the regular Cherrim flair. Removing flairs therefore is not an option.\n\nThe CSS redesign was necessary so that we could gain back at little space in our code, while also being able to add future features, like oh let\u2019s say, the Alola Pokedex Flairs. The CSS itself was designed also with another notorious complaint we have received over the last 4 years - our lack of an effective night mode. We didn't want to implement a day mode at first because it would use up some of the precious limited space we'd spent so much effort trying to earn back for future features. When we saw you were displeased with the dark background, we tried our best to implement a low resource day mode that would allow those who were displeased to have what they wanted, while also maintaining a functioning nightmode. Unfortunately, when we switch the two around, it breaks the nightmode by adding features from the day mode because it is default. Fixing these issues will further use up that precious space we've tried to gain back. When the day mode is not the default these issues are barely noticeable because it's a few black/grey bits layers on white, whereas the opposite is blinding white against an all-black layout.\n\nWe held a vote with all of these issues in mind to get a fast reply so we could figure out what to do in regards to this because we didn't want to keep flipping back and forth between the two, causing further confusion. Frankly, the white mode is horrifyingly bright because, as you guessed it, it wasn't intended as anything more than a bonus feature to appease those who were unhappy. What furthered this was during the initial release ANY COMMENT that had anything positive to say was downvoted into oblivion almost instantly. Thanks to being moderators we are able to see vote manipulation. It takes users time to see registered votes, where as we see them instantly. When a comment appears and within seconds it has -5 or -10 votes, it's clear that someone has used multiple accounts to downvote it. That my friends is brigading and is against Reddit\u2019s TOS. Over the past few days we've been accused of manipulating this vote, however the sad reality is, it's been manipulated regardless.\n\nDuring all of this, we have done our best to remain both professional, and courteous to our users, despite the wild conspiracy theories, accusations and downright offensive comments that you've slung our way - all over something we did for you. Frankly, I feel like I've wasted my time. I could have easily applied this effort toward my own personal projects (and after the absolute ungrateful and downright offensive comments I've had inboxed to me, I kind of wish I had).\n\nThis has also been probably the worst way to welcome to moderators to our subreddit. You guys have absolutely made us look like a toxic environment who can't handle when they can't have their way about every little detail. I used to boast about how we were the least toxic, most professional gaming community but after seeing half of the removed comments on the past two threads, there's no doubt in my mind I've been deluding myself. As a moderator, I've yet to issue a single ban in the last 6 months, because that's not the type of person I am. Anyone who\u2019s ever had any interaction with me on this subreddit knows that I'm always willing to listen, and try and come to some mutually beneficial solution. I'm done doing that.\n\nIf I had my way right now, we'd have a CSS-less subreddit. I had 2 future projects planned for the subreddit, one involving Pokemon GO and the other involving reviewing /r/Pokemon Draws the Dex (for the Alola Region) - however I have absolutely no interest in that going forward. Over the past two days I've had my inbox flooded with comments ranging to \"If you think this CSS is good, you should kill yourself\" to \"Whoever designed this should step down as a moderator\", and I've still yet to issue a single ban. We've never censored any of your disagreeing comments and yet we are still being treated like we're trying to force our way. We held a vote, in what might not have been the most ideal way, but we held it as such so that we could move past this because it was starting to affect our relationship with the users. We've edited our rules for much the same reason.\n\nGoing forward, I don't really care what the subreddit looks like. I've opted to take a month long vacation from this place because I honestly can't stand to be here anymore. In 24 hours you've shown me the ugliest side of this community, and frankly I hope it isn't like this when I choose to return. This will likely put additional strain on our remaining moderators, and for that I apologize. I offer this explanation in effort to give some level of transparency between the moderation team and the users because this has got to end, now. Frankly, I'll likely be turning off the CSS going forward because something I painstaking worked on now upsets me to look at, so I don't care which side wins this vote. I'd like to apologize formally to all the people who subreddit requests for this CSS to meet there needs. I'm sorry an effective dark mode will likely not be possible if day mode remains default. I apologize that we likely won't have space for flairs beyond the next day unless we scrap the soon to be broken dark mode.\n\nI apologize that I even bothered taking any initiative to change the subreddit in any way beyond its decrepit 2007 CSS - that won't happen again. When I return to moderating I'll strictly be handling post reviews. All I ask is that you stop inboxing me, as I'm going to spend the next month enjoy the other part of reddit.\n\nThank you,\n\nTechnophonix", "id": "d5s3yez"}], [{"comment": "When exactly was this poll and how come it wasn't up for longer?

We all started out as kids at some point. Small, kind of weak, but full of potential, just like the stage 1 forms. However, at some point, life came at us hard and we all had our own personal demons to combat. In Datrix, this is arrogance, in Torracat, this is immaturity, and in Brionne, this is a fear of intimacy, of showing one's emotions. But after 20 years, we've began to mature, which is also reflected in the starters. Rowlet3 is likely based off of Robin Hood, one who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. Dartrix has given up it's selfishness and wants to help others. In Litten's case, it no longer acts like a child, but has become someone strong, who is not afraid to be itself. And in Popplio's journey, it no longer hides it's emotions, but expresses itself through beautiful songs.\n\nAnd the gifted Ash-Greninja reminds anime fans of all the salt on 18th August, 2016.\n\nNever forget.\n\n> The creators at GameFreak realize that their original fans aren't children anymore and they want to express to those people that the Pokemon series has always been growing right along side them, even in the hard phases of teenage life, and even still now that **they have begun adult life.** I think that's kind of beautiful.\n\n*Meanwhile at the anime department...*\n\nNever forgive.", "id": "d8g8cql"}], [{"comment": "I think that the theme of starters growing up has been there from the start.

The character development was great, the progress Ash was making was steady and very convincing, he had a great team of Pokemon, and even had access to something no one else does (the Synchro thing with Greninja). The signs where literally all there for things to be different, and they werent'. So the reason for all this salt is this. If Ash was just going to be made to lose again, Why spend all this time hyping the Ash-Greninja thing up? Why bother giving him such a stacked team? Why bother developing his character at all? Basically everything leading up to this point was, well, pointless... as usual.\n\nIf they basically erase everything they did with Serena and Co. on top of that, I have no qualms at all calling this show worse than BW, because it's better to go in with no expectations than have them built up to such a high degree only to be crushed unrelentingly.

Probably not what fans might want, but I will get anything at this point.\n\nI doubt Serena will be carried over to Alola, nor Greninja, but it's a part of the show I accepted by now, and I understand if you don't or anyone else doesn't, really. I just hope in a good send-off and maybe some post-series appearences personally (at least in specials like Iris and Cilan did, if not in the very next series).\n\nI just think XY actually deliver on most of its promises before the misstep, and it still has time to correct it in some way.

"], [3, "I can agree with most of your points, (the friend group, dear god, and holy hell the nostalgia bating in the advertising) but I think you're significantly underselling the games as a whole. I agree with you that a lot of the draw is new graphics and nostalgia, but they're certainly not the only factors.  Other people have already pointed out the changes Gen VI have brought, but those changes (breeding mechanics, undiscovered egg group IVs, etc) carry over into ORAS, so they don't really speak to the popularity of XY specifically.  And if you're talking about nostalgia being a factor, I would think a remake game would be relying much more heavily on nostalgia than a new region game.\n\nNow, that said, I strongly prefer XY to ORAS, and I'd like to tell you why.\n\nThere are three things that made the game stand out for me: Trainer customization, Pokemon-Amie, and the Kalos region itself.\n\nTrainer customization is something I've been wishing for since I first picked up the games. I'm a big RPG fan, and I'm probably one of the only adults in the world who enjoys pokemon as an RPG rather than competitively. As such, the ability to make my character look at least similar to me is...Well, I really, really like it.  This generation is the first time I've enjoyed battling random people online.  It's silly, I know, but I feel much more like a part of the pokemon world now.\n\nNow, Pokemon-Amie is basically the other thing I've been wishing for since I got into the series. Soul Silver was previously my favorite game primarily because your pokemon walked behind you and could be interacted with outside of battle. It was limited, but it was better than nothing. I still wish they would bring it back. But now, with amie, I can PET MY POKEMON. I can give them treats and see them dance around happily!  For somebody who is admittedly terrible at pokemon battles and who really enjoys the cute-factor of the game, amie is a HUGE step forward. I wish they would expand it. I want to be able to brush my pokemon, like you could polish your badges in DPPt. I want the poke-puff colors to actually correspond to flavors and natures etc. I want more mini games to play with my pokemon. I want them to be able to walk behind me out of their balls. I want them to have idle animations when I just stand there in the field. Sniff the air, paw at the ground, etc. I want to be able to interact with my pokemon outside of battle as much as possible.\n\nOf course, they kept amie in ORAS, so it's not really a point in XYs favor over ORAS, but it still bears mentioning as a huge reason why I love gen VI as a whole. I'll be devastated if they get rid of it in gen 7. \n\nAnd then there's Kalos itself. I love Kalos. I adore the music. X is the first pokemon game where I have actually enjoyed listening to the music. I mean, it's not like the usual pokemon music is /bad/. It's just...not my style. But I love the music in Kalos. I'm especially fond of the Anistar City theme.\nI also love the locations. I think it's a very pretty region, and I enjoyed travelling across it. One of my big problems with ORAS is that there's just too damn much water in Hoenn. And while I appreciate that Hoenn is subtropical, I like having some variation in climate across a region. Kalos has warm, sun bathed coasts as well as cold mountains. Silly, I know, but I like the RPG aspect, so yeah. (I really like changing my ingame outfit to correspond with the climate and occasion, and bringing different pokemon along as well.)\n\nNow, on to the things I didn't like about XY.\nMostly, it was the friend group.  On the one hand, I love Trevor and Tierno.  I love the idea that you don't have to be good at battling, or even like battling, to love pokemon.  I'm that way, so I guess I kindof identify with Trevor and Tierno.  I love pokemon spectaculars and accumulating a living dex and breeding.  I'm terrible at the actual battling.  So yeah, I really liked the inclusion of friends who weren't \"serious\" rival trainers.\nBut then there was Shauna and Calem.\nWho were Cheren and Bianca, but watered down.  They smoothed away all of Cheren's edges and made him into a wishy-washy rival with no drive or personality.  They stole all of Bianca's character development and reduced her to a parody of herself.  Then they had the gall to call them new characters.  (Cheren and Calem even LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME DEAR GOD HOW IS THIS A NEW CHARACTER I DON'T GET IT)\n\nSo while I liked the friend group in theory, they annoyed me in practice. If Calem and Shauna had been their own characters, I think I really could have gotten behind it.\n\nAnd then there's the plot. Now, Gen V had a pretty darn good plot, despite the weird tone-switching that kept happening with the Plasma Grunts (are we PETA-style extremists who love pokemon so much we must work with our own pokemon to \"free\" pokemon from their horrible trainers, while being totally convinced we're doing the right thing and making a halfway decent argument?  Or are we actually Team Rocket clones who basically just want to make people miserable because...the plot says we're the bad guys and you'll never play with pokemon again?  WHO KNOWS~ CERTAINLY NOT US~ YOU'LL NEVER PLAY WITH POKEMON AGAIN MWAHAHAHAHA~)\n\nI feel like XY tried to continue the heavier themes from BW, but it just...Well, it wasn't bad. It was just kindof confusing. I think it's really difficult to address the kind of topics they clearly want to address while still keeping things six-year-old friendly. I feel like XY suffered from basically the same problems that plagued BW.  Namely, it kept having to cartoonify its villains motives in order to give a clear sense of \"good guys vs bad guys\" so as not to confuse younger players with too much moral ambiguity. \n\nI think ORAS actually did a much better job with their plot. They were able to paint the teams as extremists whose hearts were in the right place, while still making them villains you really wanted to beat. There was very little in the way of tone-whiplash. I really enjoyed the story. So, plot is definitely a point in ORAS's favor.\n\nAll said, it was trainer customization and the region itself that made me prefer XY over ORAS. And those things are both purely matters of personal taste. Objectively, ORAS is the superior game. It takes all the excellent mechanic changes of gen VI and seemlessly integrates them with an excellent plot and plenty of post-game content. But I still prefer XY."], [3, "I didn't like X and Y as much as many previous games - the friends irritate me and I didn't like the (few) pokemon that much.\n\nthat said, what X and Y did have was features. a ton of them. moving off the grid, the 3d, O-powers, wonder trade, friend safari, and so on. all of these were pretty good, and made up (somewhat) for the fairly lacking content.\n\nhowever, I still think ORAS was the best pair to date. they mixed the features from X and Y with the sheer volume of content from R/S/E (plus a little more, as remakes often do). \n\nI'd have to disagree with you about Gen V though. they were the only games that I actually gave up before making it to the elite 4, and they felt way more like gen 1 throwbacks than gen VI did. a lot of the gen VI pokemon are bad, but at least they try to do their own thing, while a lot of the gen V pokemon feel like carbon copies.\n\nin terms of the friend group, I actually dislike Ace the most, tierno's a non-factor, shauna's odd and borderline useless, and trevor's scripted to be worse than you at the pokedex, which is dumb. (seriously, I got to the 5th gym in one playthrough and got the wonderful conversation of \"how many pokemon have you found so far? 5? oh well, beat me again\". I don't know what trevor's been doing, but he needs to have some standards.)\n\nbut Ace (or Serena or whatever) just irritates me. the constant going on about how good they are/will be at battling gets pretty grating after a while, and it makes up waaay too much of the character. doesn't help that they're actually terrible. yes, we get it, you have parents. they're good at pokemon. maybe because they train instead of talking constantly about their parents, or their ambitions, or whatever else there is to your character. which isn't much.\n\n"], [2, "I hadnt played since gen 3.

Soul Silver was previously my favorite game primarily because your pokemon walked behind you and could be interacted with outside of battle. It was limited, but it was better than nothing. I still wish they would bring it back. But now, with amie, I can PET MY POKEMON. I can give them treats and see them dance around happily!  For somebody who is admittedly terrible at pokemon battles and who really enjoys the cute-factor of the game, amie is a HUGE step forward. I wish they would expand it. I want to be able to brush my pokemon, like you could polish your badges in DPPt. I want the poke-puff colors to actually correspond to flavors and natures etc. I want more mini games to play with my pokemon. I want them to be able to walk behind me out of their balls. I want them to have idle animations when I just stand there in the field. Sniff the air, paw at the ground, etc. I want to be able to interact with my pokemon outside of battle as much as possible.\n\nOf course, they kept amie in ORAS, so it's not really a point in XYs favor over ORAS, but it still bears mentioning as a huge reason why I love gen VI as a whole. I'll be devastated if they get rid of it in gen 7. \n\nAnd then there's Kalos itself. I love Kalos. I adore the music. X is the first pokemon game where I have actually enjoyed listening to the music. I mean, it's not like the usual pokemon music is /bad/. It's just...not my style. But I love the music in Kalos. I'm especially fond of the Anistar City theme.\nI also love the locations. I think it's a very pretty region, and I enjoyed travelling across it. One of my big problems with ORAS is that there's just too damn much water in Hoenn. And while I appreciate that Hoenn is subtropical, I like having some variation in climate across a region. Kalos has warm, sun bathed coasts as well as cold mountains. Silly, I know, but I like the RPG aspect, so yeah. (I really like changing my ingame outfit to correspond with the climate and occasion, and bringing different pokemon along as well.)\n\nNow, on to the things I didn't like about XY.\nMostly, it was the friend group.  On the one hand, I love Trevor and Tierno.  I love the idea that you don't have to be good at battling, or even like battling, to love pokemon.  I'm that way, so I guess I kindof identify with Trevor and Tierno.  I love pokemon spectaculars and accumulating a living dex and breeding.  I'm terrible at the actual battling.  So yeah, I really liked the inclusion of friends who weren't \"serious\" rival trainers.\nBut then there was Shauna and Calem.\nWho were Cheren and Bianca, but watered down.  They smoothed away all of Cheren's edges and made him into a wishy-washy rival with no drive or personality.  They stole all of Bianca's character development and reduced her to a parody of herself.  Then they had the gall to call them new characters.  (Cheren and Calem even LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME DEAR GOD HOW IS THIS A NEW CHARACTER I DON'T GET IT)\n\nSo while I liked the friend group in theory, they annoyed me in practice. If Calem and Shauna had been their own characters, I think I really could have gotten behind it.\n\nAnd then there's the plot. Now, Gen V had a pretty darn good plot, despite the weird tone-switching that kept happening with the Plasma Grunts (are we PETA-style extremists who love pokemon so much we must work with our own pokemon to \"free\" pokemon from their horrible trainers, while being totally convinced we're doing the right thing and making a halfway decent argument?  Or are we actually Team Rocket clones who basically just want to make people miserable because...the plot says we're the bad guys and you'll never play with pokemon again?  WHO KNOWS~ CERTAINLY NOT US~ YOU'LL NEVER PLAY WITH POKEMON AGAIN MWAHAHAHAHA~)\n\nI feel like XY tried to continue the heavier themes from BW, but it just...Well, it wasn't bad. It was just kindof confusing. I think it's really difficult to address the kind of topics they clearly want to address while still keeping things six-year-old friendly. I feel like XY suffered from basically the same problems that plagued BW.  Namely, it kept having to cartoonify its villains motives in order to give a clear sense of \"good guys vs bad guys\" so as not to confuse younger players with too much moral ambiguity. \n\nI think ORAS actually did a much better job with their plot. They were able to paint the teams as extremists whose hearts were in the right place, while still making them villains you really wanted to beat. There was very little in the way of tone-whiplash. I really enjoyed the story. So, plot is definitely a point in ORAS's favor.\n\nAll said, it was trainer customization and the region itself that made me prefer XY over ORAS. And those things are both purely matters of personal taste. Objectively, ORAS is the superior game. It takes all the excellent mechanic changes of gen VI and seemlessly integrates them with an excellent plot and plenty of post-game content. But I still prefer XY.", "id": "d0hk41v"}, {"comment": "Trainer customization is a great aspect of X and Y, even if I honestly don't care too much for it. I don't really like playing as myself in video games, so I generally tend to stick with default Calem. However, what they did do with it was good, and it needs to be a mainstay.\n\nI agree with Amie entirely. Not much more I can add, really. Easily the best new feature in Generation 6 thus far. I don't consider it a benefit to X and Y so much as it is to Gen 6 as a whole, however, similarly to the new Pokemon.\n\nI actually hate X and Y's soundtrack because I found it to be the most forgettable, yet love Gen V's. I think it is a very pretty region as well, but one of the issues I'm going to talk about when I get to later points is how much of Kalos' area went unused. I do think X and Y had a good variety, even if there was too much time spent on the coast and too little in the mountainous areas.\n\nThank you for hating the friend group. I like the idea of Tierno and Trevor, but the execution falls flat, especially in the former's case. I am also angry at the fact Ace and Shauna are blatant rip-offs of Cheren and Bianca, especially since they seem to garner more attention than their better counterparts because popular opinion seems to have something of a hatred boner for Gen V.\n\nXY tried to continue the heavier themes from BW, true, but it ended up failing because Team Flare didn't know what it wanted to be. I'll end up addressing Team Flare later, since they are my least favorite part about X and Y. I don't think Team Plasma was so bipolar as you suggest; I think they were a split organization, with one group genuinely following N and one group being in it for the power; this is outright confirmed in the next game, but it's unclear whether such division existed in the events of BW.\n\nORAS has a decent plot, but since the plans of the teams blatantly defy Grade 3 science it is hard for me to take it seriously. There wasn't much tone whiplash, which was good.\n\nI agree ORAS is objectively the better game, but I definitely respect your opinion. I understand most like X and Y. But I love ORAS because of all the things you just mentioned; it takes all the good from XY, blends it with the good features of RS, expands on it a little, and creates a masterpiece.

I'm currently playing through it again, though, and I've picked up Black 2.

They more come into their own later on, and I like to headcanon I just happened to run into some of Ghetsis' elite troops early on, so they were in on the real scheme the whole time, thus explaning their behavior.\n\nI suppose that's true with ORAS. While I do take issue with how they defy science, I guess legendary Pokemon just have the power of fixing that, according to their plans.

Throh and Sawk felt like an attempt to copy the hitmons, while simultaneously feeling like nothing at all. timbur gurdur and conkledurr felt like machop/machoke/machamp, but also simultaneously disgusting (it's the veins. they weird me out. also, what's with the clown noses?) troubish and garbadour try and recapture the same basic idea as grimer and muk, forgetting that it was never a particularly good idea in the first place. that being said, not that many of the gen V pokemon _were_ carbon copies. it's just that the ones that were tend to be poor copies.\n\nthere's a bunch in gen V that also feel like they don't really have a place.

Sigilyph still doesn't register as a living creature for me. Maractus fills a spot already filled by more interesting (cacnea/cacturne) and equally disappointing (Carnivine) pokemon. Emolga lowered the bar for electric rodents significantly (not that that stopped dedenne from underachieving all by itself) and heatmore just feels dumb. the monkeys are a really, really gimicky way of explaining type advantage to new players.\n\nthat said, I still maintain that the straight up worst pokemon ever made, has to be the klink family. it doesn't feel like a living machine, like magnemite. it doesn't feel like a cool collection of smaller pokemon, like dugtrio. it's just really dumb, and only gets worse as it evolves.\n\nthat being said, Gen V - since it added a decent number of pokemon - also added a bunch of really good ones too.

Not much more I can say in this regard since it seems to be universally agreed that BW had the best story.\n\n**Despite its linear nature, which is a huge problem, Unova is very memorable.** Not to the extent of Johto or Hoenn, perhaps, but Unova has many unique qualities that make it a distinct region. Victory Road is the most well-designed in the series. Dragonspiral Tower was absolutely gorgeous, especially in conjunction with the music it plays. Opelucid had the interesting gimmick of changing depending on the version you are playing. Nuvema, in my opinion, did the best job of evoking nostalgia and a sense of beginning out of all the towns, even Pallet. The Desert Resort Castle are both haunting and captivating, and I like how more of it opens up depending on where you are in the game. Castelia, while no Lumiose (which I admit I absolutely adore), is a cool place in it's own right for being the series' first real city in scope. All of these places and more make for a unique region unlike any other. I admit it is inferior to others, however.\n\n**Most of the Pokemon, except for Basculin, fuck him, are interesting in some regard.** The biggest complaint about Gen 5 is how many carbon copies there are of Generation 1 Pokemon. I'm forced to disagree. Lilipup is nothing like Rattata sans type, Unfeazant, while somewhat similar in that they are the first birds to show up, are based off of different birds and play differently, Woobat is a status user and a special attacker, Roggenrola becomes more crystaline as he evolves, Timburr uses beams versus its fists, Klinklang doesn't add more Klinks like Magneton, it adds more parts, Trubbish compliments Grimer and Koffing by finsihing a \"pollution trio\", and so on. I feel like the only real rip-offs are Throh and Sawk, which are inexcusable. The rest of the designs are unique and fantastic. Samurott is my favorite out of all of them (and indeed my favorite Pokemon), but you have such beasts as Hydreigon, Elektross, Archeops, Ferrothorn, Galvantula, Carrocosta, Darmanitan, Sigilyph, Scrafty, Volcorona, and so on. Generation 5 has the highest concentrated amount of great Pokemon, in my opinion. \n\n**The characters are the best in the entire series to date.** This kind of ties in with the story, but I feel like it is warranting of its own sub-section. N is self-explanatory. Ghetsis has the most straight-forward yet complex ambitions in the entire series, which is neat, and his descent into madness is very satisfying, unlike the other team leaders who simply give up. Cheren and Bianca, especially with their role in the sequels, are exceptionally well-developed, as I talked about in my initial post. All the gym leaders except for the Striaton Triplets play a role in the story, have interesting characters, and unlike the rest of the games, never really disappear, actively playing a role in the fight against Plasma. Iris ends up becoming Champion in the sequels, and it's interesting seeing the talented yet unrefined girl mature and become the Champion in Alder's place. Speaking of Alder, his motivations and story were well-developed, and the tragedy of his Volcorona only helped cement him. These are just summaries of the characters, and I feel like Pokemon's stories should focus more on the characters themselves, because it creates a better sense of connection with the story if they have stakes in it. \n\nI hope I haven't disappointed you with how little I posted about it.

Also, be warned, my writing style is crap without revision, so it'll sound like a list of examples of general, eh, *things* until I nail in a point.\n\nIt being Pokemon (i.e. a child's game) there needs to be clear and fairly un-innovational, obvious, character troupes and story arc. Pokemon has always been comfort food, and I don't want any change much from the original, if truth be told. Get kicked out of the house, give you a very linear yet satisfying rise to power, and have the \"challenge\" of the bad guys knocking local inhabitants and social structures around. All of Unova was just the Macaroni and Cheese of the series; Unova had no changes to the leave the house dilemma from G1, exactingly similar Pokemon species parallels, baddies, conquer the elite four, etc. (with, of course, the exception of the formulaic legend encounter, since that was instituted in G3.) The *entirety* of it was basically the first game over again, which is why most people spite this game with a burning passion, except the mode of delivery for the arc & units within.\n\nN was a \"bad guy\", and the mere implications of me needing to use air quotes there shows how special the story deviants are here. The first unequivocal  mixed bag of the entire series, no exceptions. The legendary pops up not as an outside force of God or nature, but as a type of God itself, a power that consciously enhances you as a grown character, cementing your growth instead of testing it. (Well, that's not entirely true, you need to catch it, but the catch rate is so damn high, it's not so much a trial as a formality.) Ghetsis was a manipulative-grandmother type of evil, spiting psychological spite and venom throughout the story & it's main cause, then busting so far out of the level curve it near kills you when your showdown comes. Again, a bunch of variations in *delivery*, all story related, and not substance related. This game was made for setting the binary black and white differences with the forces at work all so it could begin beating them together so hard the mutilation of boundaries and lines highlights the gray. Hell, the last variation on anything near as cool was the Magma/Aqua counter-plays, which, I might add, were beautiful.\n\nThe good guys/bad guys complex moved from having to good ol' fun scenario of G1 with the Mafia doing Mafia things to the rest of mass media's exploration of the grey. Nobody thinks their aims are evil [\"Anakin, there are many things to learn from the Dahhrk Siiyde of the Foohhrsse.\"], and that's exactly what N thought. The only exception to that character creation rule is a personal gain so great it would obliterate or exempt the \"bad behavior\", such as destroying one universe to build another and rule over it with a bunch of gambling winnings and clueless brutes in chilly North Japan. Sinnoh. I'm talking about Sinnoh. Ghetisis was a better Cyrus.\n\nThe true trials and tribulations for the game are the same for the generations that came after and before it: The god damn game mechanics can't change all that much. We haven't had a completely balanced, important, overly apparent, instinctually usable a feature for the general consumer since the Sp. Attack / Attack split in G4.  EV training & breeding got a shot in the arm, sure, but that's a clunky mechanic need for the hardcores (of which I am one). I mean, sure, Super Training is \"fun\", but it's just like the movie shoots in B/W2: Nice, but not an experience most go back for. Game Freak hasn't found a good outlet for a new competition style either. Rotation/Trios/Contests are largely unused, & disregarded. Mega evolution hasn't helped anything either, it's just an unbalanced behemoth running on Mega Garchomps and Mega Rayquazas. That had potential to bring \"new\" Pokemon like Pincer, and Aggron to the fore, mixing and cementing new strategies to make them viable again. (Not saying that  I don't want Mega Garchomp and Rayquaza, they're f*cking amazing, but the point stands.)\n\nI can't help but see how everything in the RPG bit of the actual game has been picked up, tinkered with, and left behind. Clothes, character complexities, contests, movies. Even when things work they're left behind.\n\nAbout Half of this wall of text was just me generally griping, but my main point is this: B/W, with the exception of comparatively phenomenal story, suffers from the same faults and issues as every other game. Sure the story's good, but X/Y's mechanics are better, so are the graphics. Hoenn's styling gels better with previous generations, and actually felt epic in anticipation instead of the annoyed grating of the story wheels in X/Y and B/W.

The basic formula should be by far and large the same, but BW added some different twists to make it a more memorable experience, and it is a shame X and Y seem to be straying from that path. \n\n> The legendary pops up not as an outside force of God or nature, but as a type of God itself, a power that consciously enhances you as a grown character, cementing your growth instead of testing it.\n\nI've actually never really paid much attention to the role the legendary dragons play in the story, even though it is indeed a massive one. Most notably, I haven't noticed the cementing instead of testing bit. \n\n> Again, a bunch of variations in delivery, all story related, and not substance related\n\nThis is somewhat true, but as you so pointed out yourself, all Pokemon games are like this. Name me one evil team that actually adds something new to the game itself that couldn't really just be replaced by generic trainers. All of them are like this. Team Plasma is better by comparison since the story is better, and though the gameplay itself does not improve, the game is better because of it.\n\n> Ghetsis was a better Cyrus.\n\nThis isn't related to anything, but no matter how much I gripe about Team Flare, and I do find their goals worse than Galactic's, I think Cyrus is the worst character out of all the evil team bosses. As you said, the new teams seem to be focusing more and more on grey, which was averted in Team Flare's case, who are simply blatantly evil sans Lysandre (who I'll complain about much, much later in this series). Cyrus is also a case of completely evil, as while he has good goals (in his delusions, anyway,), his method of achieving a utopia is evil in pretty much every way.\n\n> The true trials and tribulations are the same for the generations that came after and before it: The god damn game mechanics can't change all that much\n\nTrials and Tribulations? Are you an Ace Attorney fan?\n\nMore to the point, I agree with what you said. I am of the mind IVs should simply be eradicated altogether, although EVs in their current state can say. I thought the movie shoots were actually fairly popular, but alright. Rotations and Trios are only abandoned because GF has a huge boner for Double Battles for their events and Singles for main-game tradition. Mega Evolution is an unholy mess that is cool in concept but horribly executed, but I trust F enough to find a way to reduce their overall power in coming games. \n\nI feel like MEs are just fanservice more than anything else and weren't really thought over, but that's, again, for another day.\n\n> Even when things work they've been left behind.\n\nThis is Pokemon's problem on the whole, and certainly isn't unique to BW. In fact, I'd say that BW did this the least out of all the games; all that BW really abandoned was contests (EWWW, musicals) and touch screen usage (which never really bothered me).  X and Y dropped the most between its immediate predecessor, BW2, and this is another one of the major reasons I dislike them.\n\n> suffers from the same faults and issues as every other game.\n\nIn this case, it shouldn't really be a fault against BW but against the entire series, then.\n\n> Hoenn's styling gels better with previous generations, and actually felt epic in anticipation instead of the annoyed grating of the story wheels in X/Y and B/W.\n\nI don't think the story wheels were so grating. In case it isn't clear by this point, I feel Pokemon should be working more on its story and how to revolve the gameplay around it during the course of the main campaign. This is obviously not a popular approach at all, which I understand, and it will never be done.  \n\n> I'm not seeing the inherent, marked improvement of B/W vs anything else I guess.\n\nThe only areas BW really improved in are story, character development, and how to implement new Pokemon. The rest of it is very samey, but this is just like the rest of the series. Unless a new Pokemon game comes out with a better story and/or far improved gameplay from all its predecessors, BW will remain my favorite since I think it did the best job of trying new things while at the same time being just forumlaic enough to feel familiar. It's clear BW was trying to be the herald of a new approach to Pokemon, and I personally am outraged that GF abandoned this. I understand why most people disagree with me, but I am of the mind Pokemon needs to change more than it is.\n\n", "id": "d0i3egy"}, {"comment": "Since it's the easiest point to continue the conversation from, I'll start with the \"Most notably, I haven't noticed the cementing instead of testing bit\" bit. The point I was trying to make was that with the legend literally sitting in your back pocket for the goodly chunk of the campaign, you're evaluation of growth in strength and character comes from a notable \"C\" grade in the dragon's book instead of the universal beat down you lay one everyone and everything in all the other games. It only shows up when it decides something and anything is better than nothing at the last moment. \n\nEverything's grey in B/W, even your development as a character.\n\nAnd that's my point, the story is leaps and bounds better than everything else, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. Not that that's a put-down on the game, again, all the games were like that; one redeeming feature for failure in every other respect, but that doesn't particularly elevate the game higher than any competitor.\n\nThe problem Pokemon faces is that if you repeat any twists of previous games, they aren't twists, something which Pokemon purposefully exploited to make the games comfort food, to borrow the phrase again. [While I'm thinking of it, I'm gonna step over to X/Y for a bit and I'll see where it takes me.] They fell to fan service as a crutch in X/Y without re-balancing mechanics to compensate, which caused most of the problems. I Love the fact that Charizard is finally a Dragon type and that Alakazam is once more a powerhouse, but that's something that should come with just making another installment's spectacle creep. [Spectacle Creep: The need for bigger, better sequels and their crafting] I guess, here', I'd like to you a little bit of expounding on a (not necessarily) easy way to follow up on B/W's alterations.\n\nB/W is probably the only game set, near as I can tell, that's gotten and going to get a sequel due since Satoshi Tajiri's vow to \"mix things up, and keep players on their toes\" after 4 gens of the same and a 5th that began with  the same and smashed into sequel territory to change the formula. GF knows that things are amiss, look to Youkai Watch to see how terrible they're even doing in their home turf, but they're just not grasping the fundamental changes that are needed or possible with the series anymore. Pokemon implementation especially has been bad as of late, so how you think B/w did in this regard would be good to hear, but you're right, the fundamental problems are what are interfering with these games (along with the horrific easiness of X/Y) seem to be the issue now.", "id": "d0ifp38"}, {"comment": "I pretty much agree with you on most things you said, but I'd like to add again that if Tajiri said that he wanted to mix things up, how come X/Y even exist in their current forms? They are fanservice incarnate, and ORAS, while pretty incredible games, aren't different enough either, although I excuse them for being remakes.\n\nX/Y did not focus enough on the new Pokemon, mostly relying on previous generation Pokemon, especially those of Kanto early on in the game, though this mellows out later. B/W, on the other hand, did the exact opposite extreme; they barred all Pokemon but the new ones. I feel this is the best way to go about a Pokemon game, or at least the first one in the generation, as it prevents one from relying on old favorites, instead having to mix it up a bit and give the new Pokemon a chance. It would be even better now that transferring is more accessible thanks to Pokemon Bank, allowing people to still be able to gain Pokemon from previous generations. \n\nI have many gripes with X/Y, but one of them is actually not easiness. All Pokemon games are easy, and while X/Y have much worse AI and strangely enough only three moves on many enemy Pokemon, not using the EXP Share steepens the challenge quite a bit as you are eternally many levels behind, provided you're using a full team and not grinding.

(Interesting Setting = France, since, well, France) The spit out a game aimed entirely at the olden audience, with Mega Evolutions of oldie-goodies, a flat line difficulty level, and the least complex characters and stories to date. \n\nI don't think that ripping out a new game faster with less Pokemon is a bad thing either since it would prevent animated Castillia Cones turning to Pokemon, Machamp rip-offs, etc. More honed, good ideas in a shorter span (like Talonflame, my god man, bow to it's glory) to allow some breathing for them isn't a bad idea at all. The problem (which doesn't extend to the exp. share, since that's a voluntary difficulty toggle for the player, even if it needs better framing) is that they're forcing a standardized, bastardized form of the original game play in TM durability (which removed all rarity and usefulness. Go one way or another Game Freak, now we just have shit TMs that don't go away), poor rivals who only rival the last's ineptness, a PokeBank that will go offline far after the games aren't played, etc. These games are full of half measure, and that's a problem.", "id": "d0imb48"}, {"comment": "I don't get why people think Yokai Watch is such a huge issue to Pokemon's continued existence.

HGSS, on the other hand, is highly regarded by almost every fan.\n\nI do agree with most of your points."], [84, "Oh boy.. someone's living in a fantasy nostalgia world. I'll be the first to admit HGSS were my favored games purely because of my gen 1 and 2 nostalgia but in no way were they better games. A small list of terrible things in HGSS:\n\n- Horrid exp curve. This includes wild pokemon levels and trainer levels. Any kid (who the games are targeted for) who'd play this game would be severly underleveled upon hitting Indigo Plateau if they used more than 3 pokemon on their team. I'm not saying you need to dominate with levels but you want to at least be at equal levels as the Champion. With a team of six, I average level 37 when playing the game by the time I reach the league. No grinding but no skippin either, every possible trainer battle done. That's 13 levels lower than Lance's Dragonites.\n\n- Terrible variety in Pokemon. A large part of the available Pokemon are just all the low BST ones from RBY and GSC and overal very hard to get certain Pokemon types.\n\n- Enormous list of mostly mandatory HM's. To the point where you'd need two HM slaves possibly even 3 if you don't use a water type on your team. It's absurd. I saw this as a step back as there were effort to reducing the HMs by making Flash TM70. They could have made great strides here by furthering it in HGSS.\n\n- HGSS has a huge Post Game, but if you look at FRLG and ORAS, there is an actual story (some might hate it but I considered it fun) and there is some other stuff to do then just beat another 8 gym leaders, in a very abridged Kanto and basically continue doing what you did all the hours before. At least Delta had you doing more of a quest rather than just mindless battling again. FRLG had cool new areas that weren't in the original games at all.\n\nAlso most of the points you made in your handy sheet up there can also be said about HGSS, all the other points you make are minor details that might be important to YOU but honestly can't be used when fairly judging the game as a whole.Like: 'The number of Trick House puzzles is reduced' and 'The Sky Pillar bike challenge is removed'.\n\nAlso don't get the point about most trainers and gym leaders not having Mega Evolutions. Do you not get what Mega Evolution is? It makes absolutely no sense for Youngster Joey to have Mega Raticate. Nor does it make sense that Gym Leaders with Pokemon on their team that aren't even fully evolved to also have super overpowered Mega Evolutions. As such you only see it on high profile trainers like Steven and Archie and what not. Even still, the trainers that can wield Mega Evolution are a chosen few and that's how it should be.\n\nFinally, about the casualization of the game, yeah, did you live inside a cave for the past 10 years? This has been a trend since gen 4.  While it's hard for people to let go of their nostalgia and give up on all that invested pride and hard work on completing those terribly hard Pokemon games of old that required an immense amount of skill (lol), it has been a good thing for the game. It's the main reason why competitive battling is more popular and easier to get into. That's what casualization did."], [80, "Most of the reasons listed in that image are due to Game Freak's stubbornness on certain issues:\n\n- Customization is kept out because beauty is a theme for Kalos, and makes XY stand out more.\n\n- Game Freak is competing against mobile games for kids' attention. They target young kids because they can be retained for more years than adult players. Game Freak dumbed down difficult aspects of the game so kids can progress through the game quickly. To GF, the hardcore gamers are a niche market and should be catered to less than kids. Hence easier boss battles, easy Safari Zone, and no Battle Frontier.\n\n- Patching XY for ORAS features may be detimental to ORAS sales. Cheating devices, save game editors, and similar data manipulation technologies can edit a XY game for the ORAS exclusive content. Who will buy ORAS if most of its content is already in XY? Game Freak wants to make money; choosing not to patch XY would ensure people who want the exclusive content quickly buy ORAS.\n\nOther complaints are just nitpicking:\n\n- Some Megas are overpowered and others are underpowered. Um, hello, XY had the exact same thing; Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gengar, Mega Mawile, and a few others are OP, and many other Megas are underpowered. That's the inevitability of creating 30 or so Mega Evolutions; trying to balance them out is nearly impossible. Every competitive game will have overpowered and underpowered characters. And in Game Freak's case, they gave certain abilities to Megas for flavoring reasons; Mega Audino heals others, and Mega Salamence is characterized by its desire to fly.\n\n- Very few trainers use Megas... Um, how many trainers used them in XY? It's just Korrina, Lysandre, Diantha, and your rival, iirc. No other trainer actually uses Megas in game. Korrina is the only Gym Leader in Kalos to use it. At least in ORAS, you have more Mega Evolution trainers with the Hoenn E4, Zinnia, and in contests, Lisia.\n\n- Cosplay Pikachu... I don't like how she is ORAS exclusive, but then again HGSS had Spiky-Eared Pichu, and she was far worse. The Pichu couldn't evolve, can't get a Light Ball boost, had access to a bad exclusive move, and was event exclusive. Cosplay Pikachu and Spiky-Eared Pichu primarily exist to market the anime and movies.\n\n- There aren't as many Pokemon available in these games... ORAS are remakes of RS, so most of the Pokemon you should be able to acquire in these remakes are the same. Besides, ORAS had a limited selection of Pokemon because you are supposed to catch most of the absent Pokemon in XY. ORAS at least had DexNav Pokemon (granted they're post-game) that are difficult to acquire in XY unless you had a specific Friend Safari or transferred them from a previous generation. Game Freak wants people to buy all four games, so they put almost every Pokemon available across all four games.\n\n- Almost every ORAS feature was officially announced before the games were released. This is just a surprise factor more than anything. People were bound to find out about these features sooner or later, and in Pokemon's case, a game's full contents are often revealed weeks before the release."], [55, "[What](http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee371/shadd16/tumblr_mjq10uA1Wu1r5wkkso1_1280_zps1dd9b0fc.png) I think of whenever I see a post like this"], [47, "Alot of these seem like opinions.\n\n"], [47, "Really?

I like the games, despite them being so damn easy. It's a casual game, for casual fun.\n\nI don't care for gym rematches.\n\nI don't remember Sky Pillar's bike challenge and... I also don't really remember Granite Cave, either. xD\n\nIMO, the safari zone in HGSS was just annoying and was needlessly complicated.\n\nDon't remember the Mirage Tower.\n\nI didn't blend berries in the original games, and most I've heard about it was that it was annoying. It is too easy in ORAS, however.\n\nDon't really care one way or the other for Game Corners.\n\nSeperating pok\u00e9marts was damn annoying. AND WHY NO POK\u00c9BALL SHOP! Sure, it wasn't in the original but adding something new couldn't hurt IMO.\n\nHM's are damn annoying.\n\nDon't care for the Trick House.\n\nI'm so damn used to running in these games, I'd forget to toggle run anyway. xD\n\nYou can avoid spoilers, sure it's way more hard nowdays but it's possible.\n\nI don't see a benefit for GameFreak to update XY with the new megas. After all, they want people to buy the new games.\n\nSome pok\u00e9mon are strong, others aren't. It's always been like that and it will always be like that.\n\nCosplay Pikachu was useless to begin with IMO, and I was never a fan of any of the cosplay variants. I don't think there would have been any benefit to transfer it to 7th gen, other than if you really like cosplay Pikachu. But it's not like you're gonna stop play ORAS just because there's a new game, so it'll still be in your old game.\n\nI don't really care for contests, but I suppose it would have been nice for those who do to be able to do it online.\n\nMegas probably will remain unused by regular trainers in the next games. It was a damn shame they don't appear in the Battle Maison. At the very least Ace Trainers and Veterans should have had a mega.\n\nI don't need a physical bonus to buy the games, I think it's better to not have it.\n\nDude... there's a million legendaries in ORAS. It's a bit much to ask for a friggin' maze, puzzle or dungeon for each and every one of them.\n\nTM's in mirage spots... is complete and utter BS. And so is getting Cresselia.\n\nDexnav is awesome, if you want egg moves and hidden abilities. It doesn't take too long and it's not annying IMO. Using it to shiny hunt... now that's a grind and I'd rather breed a shiny. Dexnaving in caves and on water is BS, though.\n\nWith XY and ORAS, you can get every pok\u00e9mon except for mythical pok\u00e9mon (and now with the current events... you can... if you're lucky). Well, you can get one regardless.\n\nI spend most of the post game shiny hunting, breeding or doing wifi battles. I don't really need new places to explore. Heck, I haven't even explored everywhere on my Alpha Sapphire copy (I have on my Omega Ruby copy).\n\nAll evil pok\u00e9mon teams... are pretty much the same.\n\nI don't care if Flygon gets a mega evolution or not.

Anyone who has played XY previously would know that the EXP share is incredibly OP and made their team overleveled. So if they are aware of this and wanted the game to be easier why would they not turn it off? The EXP share basically works as an \"easy mode\" for the game, which you can simply turn off, but people who want a challenge still choose to use it. They then complain that the game is too easy, even though they had the option to turn off an item which basically added an \"easy mode\" which I find to be really ridiculous. \n\ntl;dr- I find it ridiculous that people complain about ORAS's being \"too easy\" even though they had the option to turn the EXP share off.

In HGSS they actually increased some of the trainer levels, but oops forgot to increase wild pokemon levels to make grinding up new pokemon not a pain. Having EVs instead of stat experience also hurt the level gaps even more compared to playing Gold/Silver/Crystal--this is stuff they should have realized. For ORAS they should have realized that even with exp share off the R/S trainer levels were too easy and, an even greater sin, too boring since everybody had small teams. Both games also had lazy \"oops\", boring moveset situations related to the way the games auto-level most trainer and wild pokemon--specific auto-levels that were fine for gen II or gen III move learn lists are sometimes not for gen IV or gen VI learn lists. That's a lesson they should have learned more generally--when you lazily copy something from an older generation while also keeping the changes of a newer generation you are going to get garbage as the end result if you're not doing it carefully. \n\nThat said, HGSS just had tons of new stuff and kept all of the cool stuff from Platinum.

They could even re-release new Pok\u00e9walkers with limited edition designs (Premier Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball, Master Ball, Dusk Ball, Net Ball, Luxury Ball, etc) for the use with HG/SS on the 3DS (the cart originally had IR built into the cart itself, but the 3DS actually has it's own IR port).

I'll be the first to admit HGSS were my favored games purely because of my gen 1 and 2 nostalgia but in no way were they better games. A small list of terrible things in HGSS:\n\n- Horrid exp curve. This includes wild pokemon levels and trainer levels. Any kid (who the games are targeted for) who'd play this game would be severly underleveled upon hitting Indigo Plateau if they used more than 3 pokemon on their team. I'm not saying you need to dominate with levels but you want to at least be at equal levels as the Champion. With a team of six, I average level 37 when playing the game by the time I reach the league. No grinding but no skippin either, every possible trainer battle done. That's 13 levels lower than Lance's Dragonites.\n\n- Terrible variety in Pokemon. A large part of the available Pokemon are just all the low BST ones from RBY and GSC and overal very hard to get certain Pokemon types.\n\n- Enormous list of mostly mandatory HM's. To the point where you'd need two HM slaves possibly even 3 if you don't use a water type on your team. It's absurd. I saw this as a step back as there were effort to reducing the HMs by making Flash TM70. They could have made great strides here by furthering it in HGSS.\n\n- HGSS has a huge Post Game, but if you look at FRLG and ORAS, there is an actual story (some might hate it but I considered it fun) and there is some other stuff to do then just beat another 8 gym leaders, in a very abridged Kanto and basically continue doing what you did all the hours before. At least Delta had you doing more of a quest rather than just mindless battling again. FRLG had cool new areas that weren't in the original games at all.\n\nAlso most of the points you made in your handy sheet up there can also be said about HGSS, all the other points you make are minor details that might be important to YOU but honestly can't be used when fairly judging the game as a whole.Like: 'The number of Trick House puzzles is reduced' and 'The Sky Pillar bike challenge is removed'.\n\nAlso don't get the point about most trainers and gym leaders not having Mega Evolutions. Do you not get what Mega Evolution is? It makes absolutely no sense for Youngster Joey to have Mega Raticate. Nor does it make sense that Gym Leaders with Pokemon on their team that aren't even fully evolved to also have super overpowered Mega Evolutions. As such you only see it on high profile trainers like Steven and Archie and what not. Even still, the trainers that can wield Mega Evolution are a chosen few and that's how it should be.\n\nFinally, about the casualization of the game, yeah, did you live inside a cave for the past 10 years? This has been a trend since gen 4.  While it's hard for people to let go of their nostalgia and give up on all that invested pride and hard work on completing those terribly hard Pokemon games of old that required an immense amount of skill (lol), it has been a good thing for the game. It's the main reason why competitive battling is more popular and easier to get into. That's what casualization did.", "id": "d173lt9"}, {"comment": "Regarding the exp curve: It can be said ORAS has the same issue in the opposite direction, with trainers being far too weak by the end of the game. Some people enjoy Pokemon in the wild being generally weaker instead of scaling up dramatically in the order the routes are meant to be played-in some ways it makes a more believable world. Similarly, some folks like the challenge this provides. This point against HGSS really comes down to preference.\n\nRegarding Pokemon variety: Again, this can be preference as well. Some players prefer some of the Pokemon to be genuinely rare and hard to find as opposed to having wild psuedo-legends before the second gym. Note that ORAS basically maintains the variety of the original version to an even greater degree than HGSS did, since HGSS added in a mid-game safari zone as well as benefitting from many 4th gen evolutions (though to be fair, ORAS gets some of these as well)\n\nRegarding HM use: ORAS and HGSS are both guilty of this. I mostly agree, but I don't think it makes HGSS any worse than ORAS.\n\nRegarding Delta: Once again, this comes down to preference, but I personally am FAR more in the camp of Kanto>Delta. You can call Delta \"more of a quest\"...OK sure, more of a glorified fetch quest mostly characterized by more mindless battling with Magma/Aqua grunts. HGSS's \"mindless battling\" is far more varied than what you encounter in the Delta Episode, and Kanto is not nearly as mindless an extension as I feel you depict here. Exploring the Kanto region three years after the classics and seeing how things have changed is far more meaningful to me than flying between Rustboro, Dewford, Lilycove, and Mossdeep for two hours. I am not trying to convince you that other postgames are better than Delta Episode-but in fairness, the Delta Episode can be cast in at least just as negative a light as the others. It's not fair to accuse someone of living in a fantasy nostalgia world when similar principles may be operating on preference for the newer games.\n\nI am not sure it is fair to trivialize the removal of areas as something that \"can't be used when fairly judging the game as a whole\". When the game is trying to be a faithful recreation of the original and an area is removed without good reason, that comes across as incomplete. You can claim these are \"minor details that might be important to YOU\", but who is to say they are not major details, or even minor details that become major when added together, that you have decided are not important contrary to how others feel? It may be, too, that no one detail OP listed even comes close to ruining the game-but taken as a whole, lots of almost trivial details can paint a picture of sloppiness.\n\nFinally, you claim casualization is a good thing for the game. What precisely do you mean by casualization? If you mean making breeding and catching strong wild Pokemon easier, I absolutely agree, that has made competitive battling more accessible and probably more popular. In the context of the OP, however, it seems more likely that you are referring to making the in-game experience easier and more hand-holding, as OP describes. In which case, I think you will find it much more difficult to justify that this specifically is objectively good or contributing to competitive popularity-in fact, I believe Masuda has stated that the removal of a difficult ingame experience is precisely because relatively few people are interested in competitive battling.", "id": "d17923m"}, {"comment": "I agree with this completely. Kanto was hands-down, the best post-game for any of the main line pokemon games. It was literally another region of content\n\nI remember beating Gold when I was a kid, and realizing that the old region I played before was accessible in the same game. They made it even better in HGSS by having scaled up pokemon (despite wild pokemon still being completely weak).\n\nDelta episode, in comparison, just seemed like they were trying to hype up an upcoming fight and the end of the episode. Also not as much in depth as HGSS..\n Whereas in HGSS/Gold/Silver/Crystal, Red was completely optional, and was just rumored to be in a location to fight you.", "id": "d17exiv"}], [{"comment": "Most of the reasons listed in that image are due to Game Freak's stubbornness on certain issues:\n\n- Customization is kept out because beauty is a theme for Kalos, and makes XY stand out more.\n\n- Game Freak is competing against mobile games for kids' attention. They target young kids because they can be retained for more years than adult players. Game Freak dumbed down difficult aspects of the game so kids can progress through the game quickly. To GF, the hardcore gamers are a niche market and should be catered to less than kids. Hence easier boss battles, easy Safari Zone, and no Battle Frontier.\n\n- Patching XY for ORAS features may be detimental to ORAS sales. Cheating devices, save game editors, and similar data manipulation technologies can edit a XY game for the ORAS exclusive content. Who will buy ORAS if most of its content is already in XY? Game Freak wants to make money; choosing not to patch XY would ensure people who want the exclusive content quickly buy ORAS.\n\nOther complaints are just nitpicking:\n\n- Some Megas are overpowered and others are underpowered. Um, hello, XY had the exact same thing; Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Gengar, Mega Mawile, and a few others are OP, and many other Megas are underpowered. That's the inevitability of creating 30 or so Mega Evolutions; trying to balance them out is nearly impossible. Every competitive game will have overpowered and underpowered characters. And in Game Freak's case, they gave certain abilities to Megas for flavoring reasons; Mega Audino heals others, and Mega Salamence is characterized by its desire to fly.\n\n- Very few trainers use Megas... Um, how many trainers used them in XY? It's just Korrina, Lysandre, Diantha, and your rival, iirc. No other trainer actually uses Megas in game. Korrina is the only Gym Leader in Kalos to use it. At least in ORAS, you have more Mega Evolution trainers with the Hoenn E4, Zinnia, and in contests, Lisia.\n\n- Cosplay Pikachu... I don't like how she is ORAS exclusive, but then again HGSS had Spiky-Eared Pichu, and she was far worse. The Pichu couldn't evolve, can't get a Light Ball boost, had access to a bad exclusive move, and was event exclusive. Cosplay Pikachu and Spiky-Eared Pichu primarily exist to market the anime and movies.\n\n- There aren't as many Pokemon available in these games... ORAS are remakes of RS, so most of the Pokemon you should be able to acquire in these remakes are the same. Besides, ORAS had a limited selection of Pokemon because you are supposed to catch most of the absent Pokemon in XY. ORAS at least had DexNav Pokemon (granted they're post-game) that are difficult to acquire in XY unless you had a specific Friend Safari or transferred them from a previous generation. Game Freak wants people to buy all four games, so they put almost every Pokemon available across all four games.\n\n- Almost every ORAS feature was officially announced before the games were released. This is just a surprise factor more than anything.

That assumes that the arguments in OP's post are valid and correct, so that any disagreement must be borne of apologism, as opposed to some of the OP's arguments being wrong or mere opinion, which I would say some are.\n\n\n\nNot least the implication that HGSS is underappreciated compared to ORAS. As far as I'm aware most people *love* HGSS, and rightfully so. \n\n\n\nSome of the bullet points are just nitpicky (Pok\u00e9mon Centres and Marts are separate buildings - so what? \"The remake changed some things and left others intact\" is a non-point).\n\n\n\nSome are not framed against HGSS per the topic title (Mega Salamence is OP... well, yeah, and? We all know Game Freak gives no fucks about balancing high level competitive play, it's not like that's changed since Gen 4, and HGSS only gets away with it for not having introduced new Pok\u00e9mon/Megas at all).\n\n\n\nI can point to at least one bullet that's straight up worse in HGSS: OP's image says Cosplay Pikachu is useless, despite the fact that HGSS had the spiky eared Pichu.\n\n\n\nI would contest the validity of the claims about the DexNav. I can cite at least one advantage it has over breeding and trading, which is the relative ease of getting egg moves. You don't need specific parents like you would with breeding. Trading requires someone willing to trade with you. It also provides probably the most convenient way of scoring Hidden Abilities.\n\n\n\nAnd some complaints are really just personal preference. No physical bonus? No GB sounds (I'd call that an especially *good* feature in HGSS, not a *bad* non-inclusion in ORAS)? Showing what team others will battle when they enter your base?\n\n\n\nI'd say the most valid complaints there are: no Battle Frontier, no gym leader rematches, poor Contest depth, incomplete compatibility with X and Y (the corollary point about guaranteeing that future games won't be fully compatible with ORAS is pure assumption, however), TMs in Mirage Spots, few postgame areas.\n\n\n\nOverall the contention that ORAS \"falls flat\" is hyperbolic. The notion that ORAS is meant as a sequel to X and Y comes out of nowhere, and in what way was HGSS meant to be a sequel to DPPt?

Having EVs instead of stat experience also hurt the level gaps even more compared to playing Gold/Silver/Crystal--this is stuff they should have realized. For ORAS they should have realized that even with exp share off the R/S trainer levels were too easy and, an even greater sin, too boring since everybody had small teams. Both games also had lazy \"oops\", boring moveset situations related to the way the games auto-level most trainer and wild pokemon--specific auto-levels that were fine for gen II or gen III move learn lists are sometimes not for gen IV or gen VI learn lists.

", "id": "d8caxm6"}, {"comment": "This has nothing to do with Pok\u00e9mon but... sure haha. \n\nBasically there's a bunch of interpretations about Revelations. To give a very broad overview, some think it's a metaphorical-like telling of the 1st century Jesus times, some think it's a clever creative telling of the fall of the Roman Empire, some think it's a secret code to deliver a message to persecuted Christians, and some believe it's a word for word account of the end of the world. I happen to believe it's a mix of the first two depending on when I read it and what I pick out. But the popular theme for the fear, doom, and gloom(there's something Pok\u00e9mon) Christians is to say \"this is how the world will end!\" because it's the easiest thing to explain. With the other explanations there's SO much imagery and allegory and numerology that it requires a ton of research and knowledge(much like most of the Bible, but I'll get off my soap box) so people don't push it to the forefront as much. Also... the Middle Ages really messed up how theology was taught to the public, and Sinners In The Hands of an Angry God really scared a bunch of early Americans and we're still paying the price. Lol. \n\nThere's a lot of information out there, in fact I just googled a little bit to refresh myself on a few words and phrases so if you're interested then it's there to find. I first learned a lot of this though in 7th Grace catholic school so it's not like it's completely unheard of. Also, I know I have friends who were \"messed up\"(I don't know if that's the right word to use) by Revelation. Like, they took it literally as a kid and now have some baggage. I always recommend Rob Bell's book Love Wins. It's a really easy and great read that might offer a refreshing perspective on what we're talking about. \n\nHope that helps some. Back to Pok\u00e9mon.
