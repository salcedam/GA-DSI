But, before I do so, I'm going to make your crazy-boy envy go completely off the charts with some facts.  I already know your fake response -- \"you're lying, prove it, blah, blah\" -- but you'll know it's all true if you have even one functioning brain cell in your head (but whether you do or not is certainly debatable).  We know that you won't admit knowing the truth, but you will know it.  Are you ready for your envy and blood pressure to skyrocket?  Are you sitting down?  OK, here it is:\n\nI retired very wealthy and very young -- that was over five years ago.  I've earned more money and have more passive income starting from literally nothing than you'd ever dream of having in 100 lifetimes.  And I did all that by a very early age.  I've financially supported many other people to whom I really owe no support obligations.  I support more people than you could possibly support in 100 lifetimes.  \n\nSo, my past 5+ years have been a very long and fun luxury vacation, which will continue the rest of my life with plenty to spare.  I've done all kinds of great stuff and will continue to do so.  But, you want to know what I've done more than anything else?  Working out at gyms.  Why?  Because it's my favorite thing to do.  I work out several hours each day and I study all of this stuff, among other things.  I know more about health, fitness, and nutrition than you'll ever know -- in addition to sooooooo many other things.  I've spent more time in gyms over the past five years than you've spent sleeping or working.  \n\nSo, imagine what I must look like if I'm working out several hours each day for over five years with no other obligations or responsibilities.  And that doesn't even account for what I did in the years before that.  If you were to ever see me in person, you wouldn't be talking all of this childish and foolish trash.  You'd be running for the hills or you'd be on your best child-like behavior.  Or you'd be begging for forgiveness and mercy (which I would graciously grant to you).  \n\nDuring all those hours you've been punching a clock, worried about your supervisor, complaining about your hourly wage, and applying for government benefits (because you never learned to write or think and you're not smart), I've been relaxing and working out and traveling (catching another flight tomorrow morning, in fact) and otherwise living in total independence and freedom.  Generally, I've been on a permanent and well-earned vacation.  Days of the week, holidays, weekends, times of day?  They're all the same to me -- all irrelevant.  Restraints on my time or freedom?  Zero.  I only do what I love doing -- and that's mostly working out and learning.  \n\nThis will continue forever.  Your life.  My life.  They can't change, unless maybe you catch up by winning a huge lottery or something.  I know you're not smart, so let me inform you that you're much more likely to be struck by lightning 10 different times than you are to win the big lottery jackpot, so don't waste your little money.  The lottery is for people like you who are bad at math.  But now I've saved you some money.  You're welcome.  \n\nSo, be sure of one thing.  I'm wealthier (by orders of immeasurable magnitude), more intelligent (by orders of immeasurable magnitude), bigger, stronger, faster, and leaner than you are or ever will be.  Your pity should be reserved for yourself and only for yourself.  Pitying yourself won't get you much, but it does give you reasons, motivation, and energy to complain, to blame others, to become obsessed with others, and to envy others.  For that, I'll add my pity of you to your pity of you and we can both pity you in the most sincere way.  \n\nSo, I'm going to sleep now and I'm going to forget that your miserable, pitiful, and sorry life ever got onto my radar screen.  In a just world, I'd have never noticed you in any way on any level.  I might or might not write briefly to laugh at you if you remain obsessed with me.  Or maybe not.  It just depends on how I feel and how much additional pain I think you're asking for and how much more I'm willing to give you.  \n\nBut while I'm ignoring you or casually and cheerfully laughing at you, I know that you'll be crazy with envy, rage, and anger.  It's already happened.  Your blood pressure is off the hook.  You're already on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  I'll be sleeping peacefully, enjoying my permanent-vacation life, and ignoring you while you'll remain filled with hate and envy for who knows how long.  I'm confident that, for the next several weeks or months, these facts will occupy your mind and your rage will persist.  So, I feel very sorry for you.   But I feel much more sorry for anyone who knows you in real life and is forced to deal with you in real life.  \n\nNow, take a deep breath, get that blood pressure under control, and find a therapist.  You need all the external professional help you can get with your government benefits.  Our mutual pity for you isn't really going to do the job.  Good luck.  \n\nEdit -- typo, kool-aid, boy", "id": "cy5ws4n"}, {"comment": "Never seen so much bullshit in one place in my life, get a grip you compulsively lying, narcissistic scum.", "id": "cy63fep"}, {"comment": "Yeah, right.

It's an emotional disease and the most destructive human emotion -- resenting another person for (and feeling bad about) something the other person have or have done that has zero negative impact on the envious person.

They are also far more important than any boyfriend's jealousy.\nI think you should keep doing what you're doing and completely ignore or affirmatively/firmly reject any signs of envy or jealousy that manifest in others.

Your upper back/shoulders/arms hold the weight in place as you stand up.\n\nYour trunk needs to be held in a stable position in order to do the lift. Since the weight is loaded in front of your body and center of gravity and you are standing up from a bent-over position, you are primarily using your posterior chain - spinal erectors, glutes, hamstrings - to do this, so the back side of your trunk is doing more work to stabilize your spine than the front.\n\nEdit: typo."], [1, "So if you're doing deadlifts right your lats should be flexed from start to finish and your back should stay really tight. The easy way to get this done is if you have a chest logo on your shirt. You should try to deadlift so you can see it throughout your whole lift. My form can still use some work but you can notice how tight my back is throughout the whole lift, and the heavier the weights get its hard to avoid a small natural curve.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BDH9ht1Aspp/?taken-by=ralphyaa"], [1, "Each muscle group serves a different purpose in the mechanics of movement. Just because your core is capable of extension and flexion (as well as rotation, yada yada) the core's primary purpose is to support and resist movement to protect the spine.\n\nFor example, the thoracic spine (upper back) is the spinal region responsible for producing the most efficient rotation. It makes sense, in that case, to train the the upperback for proper rotation ROM (both passively, static stretching; and actively, twist and push like passing a basketball to your side). The thoracic spine is also responsible for extension, so make sure you include exercises that allow for greater strength/stability/mobility in the extension movement pattern. The deadlift serves it's purpose by functionally strengthening the upperback to maintain an extended position.\nIt also helps to strengthen a neutral lumbar position which will help to protect the spine even more from unwanted acceleration/deceleration, which is how injuries occur. \n\nHowever, the lumbar region is very specific in that there isn't meant to be massive range of movement - so you wouldn't need to train the lower back to rotate a lot. \nIf you feel like your body isn't able to rotate a lot, take a look at the joints that produce rotation (ankle, hip, thoracic spine, shoulders) and see where you may be tight/weak and then improve from there.\n\nWhen the body has achieved proper movement patterns throughout all the joints, the deadlift will exert an extremely high load on the latissimus dorsi (the pullup muscle) because it needs to be strong, NOT by shortening but by remaining long. This helps a lot of people build really strong lats in an extended length.\n\nMuscle building and strength training can happen in all kinds of movements, including keeping them isometrically engaged. Talk to a physical therapist about these kind of questions, most personal trainers come from body building backgrounds where their competitive shelf life is quite low. If you're training for long term health, make sure you train all the muscle groups the way they most benefit your body.\n\nFeel free to PM me too, I know it can be hard/impossible to get lots of help from physical therapists.\n\n~~~~~\n\nShoutout to Mike Boyle and Eric Cressey (big fan of their work), check out their stuff online if you're interested in training your body optimally."]], [[{"comment": "Deadlift heavy and tell me it's not a back exercise", "id": "d1ffznm"}, {"comment": "I deadlift as heavy as I can 3x8 and my hams are dead, my back feels nice.

I'd say the vast majority of barbell exercises are dynamic exercises that have a tremendously important isometric component.  Squats, front squats, loaded carries, deads, overhead press, bent rows, cleans, jerks, snatches, all manner of unilateral work, etc, are all dynamic movements with a significant isometric component.  This is because one of the most important functions of the trunk musculature is to maintain a static spinal position under load as you move the extremities.  \n\nThe whole point of basing a program around big compounds that work large areas of musculature across the entire body is that the majority of these lifts require you to work one part of the body isometrically to provide a base for another part of the body to move.\n\n>Isometric may work your core\n\nYour back musculature isn't part of your core?

However, the majority of comments should not be pumping the OP for more information.  Without the pertinent information and diagnostics, giving a useful critique or advice is not possible.  \n\nIt stands to reason that if you want to create your own programming you should have a modicum of programming knowledge and the wherewithal to know how your body responds to certain training tactics.  If you don't have this prerequisite knowledge, learn **[why nobody is critiquing your workout](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1f1kqy/why_nobody_is_critiquing_your_workout_read_this/)** and why this rule exists. \n \n**Programming advice or routine critique requests must include the following information:**\n \n* **Your current stats**: Age, Height, Weight, and relevant PR(s) for whatever you are trying to achieve.\n \n* **A detailed goal**. \"I want to get stronger\" is not a detailed goal.  Specific goals require specific help - especially from people who have already achieved that goal - so that is what the focus should be on.  \n \n * A detailed version of \"I want to get stronger\" is \"I want to add 50lb to my squat\".  Even more detail would include a date or event by which you want to achieve that goal.  Other examples: \"I have a race in July and I want to drop 5 minutes off my 10K time\" or \"I want to make the 74kg class at an upcoming meet\".   \n \n* Proposed weight programs should include **rep and set schemes** and ALL programs should include a **progression plan**.  A list of body parts or exercises is just that \u2013 a list.  Proper programming requires much more information and planning.  \n \n* If you are engaging is multiple **training modalities** (e.g. triathlon training; lifting + conditioning + sport specific practice) be sure to mention it as this will enable more holistic assessments and suggestions.  \n\n\n\n[/r/Fitness Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules) | [/r/Fitness Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/wiki/index) | [reddit's rules](/wiki/rules) | [reddit wiki](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/index) | [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette) \n\n## PLEASE NOTE: We **do not** field moderation questions via Private Message.

Perfect form is a myth and some fittitors will deload themselves into oblivion to chase it. \n\n\nAlso it seems to be a thing with stronglifts that when people stall they will just deload and work on form instead of adding more volume."], [23, "You have decades to improve your lifts and get that body you want. You can destroy your body in seconds due to irresponsible form. Emphasizing form has the double benefit of encouraging patience."], [25, "When providing advice on the internet, you have no idea what sort of person is asking the question, or what sort of person is reading it after and thinks that the advice applies to them.  Therefore the advice has to be generic and defensive enough that it applies in the worst case.  \n\nThere are rules and there are times when rules need to be broken.  The important part is knowing that you are breaking the rule and know enough about the consequences to make an informed risk/benefit analysis.  \n\nAs for that article, it's largely BS.  I have never heard of anyone suggesting you \u201cdeload to the bar\u201d if you start rounding on your deadlift, for example.  It's using hyperbole as a strawman to discredit common sense.   "], [13, "I think it is more of focusing on all the small elements of the lift. When you're close to max you'll never be perfect. \n\nI kept having elbow pain during SL and couldn't figure out why. I traced it to my squat and found I was pushing my hands into the bar to keep it on my back. Focused on keeping back super tight and moved from gripping the bar to resting my hands on it and boom, no more pain. \n\nSo less \"FORM MUST BE PERFECT\" and more \"be aware of all aspects of your body and mechanics\""], [14, "Yes. Constantly. I've never seen so many people looking for reasons to take weight off the bar and go backwards on purpose. \n\nAlso all the talk about cues. What cues do you use for this, what cues do you use for that? If you are squatting 95lbs the only cue you need is the guy unlocking the doors to the gym so you can get started."], [13, "Form does not mean technique. I think /r/fitness is obsessed with technique - small changes that can help you become stronger in the long run, which is not a bad thing at all IMO. \n\nEveryone could practice some tweaks that will help them lift more efficiently. Form is simply doing the movement in a safe fashion and is really not hard to understand."], [12, "Fittit is made mainly of new lifters who have trouble differentiating between \"less than perfect\" form and \"dangerous\" form. \n\nA rigid, braced, slightly rounded back on a deadlift is not dangerous."], [10, "This subreddit suffers from some of the same ailments as many others...\n\nA bunch of likely amateurs who have way more info/data than experience and have developed very strict standards (in their heads) for what is acceptable... anything.  In this case, form, diet, etc.  \n\nLike a lot of subs, get GENERAL info from them but read articles from other sites to get better versed in the theories.  Hell, people should even read a few conflicting points from time to time then think for themselves a bit in the end.  Then, as in this case, start learning from experience as well. "], [7, "There's a balance to be had here. Work every rep with 100% awful form, you'll end up paralyzed.\n\nBecome obsessed with every PR looking perfect, and you'll never allow yourself to lift heavy enough to really be great. Slight imperfections in your PR attempt aren't the end of the world. "], [9, "Every time I've got injured in training has been because of poor form. Definitely something worth worrying about. "], [5, "Yes, of course there is an over-obsession with \"form\".  Form is important, but the obsession here is way over the top.  Also true of several other topics, such as protein, coffee, minimal alcohol use, etc.\n\nFirst of all, all some guy has to do is make the unsubstantiated anecdotal claim that \"I minimally deviated slight from perfect form and every joint in my body exploded\" and he's trumped all evidence and common sense.  OMG, if you dare to say that some detail doesn't matter, you're going to cause everyone to make all their joints explode!!!!  \n\nSecond of all, blaming one's lack of strength on \"poor form\" by everyone who can lift more, rather than building strength and/or being happy with the strength you have, is a common defense mechanism.  (EDIT - If you really think some person can only lift more than you because he isn't using \"proper ROM\", prove that you're stronger by doing it the way they do, with more weight.  Caveat, what you see people doing in the gym only tells you they can do at least that much; you don't know their training schedule.)\n\nMost of what people call \"poor form\" is not necessarily an injury risk, but rather, use of mechanical advantage to move more weight.  It is foolish to do this too much, because it makes it harder to track your progress and sacrifices strength training for movement specific coordination training.  (In fact people who aren't very fit but become very good at some exercise that is awkward to perform to draw attention to themselves are an extreme example of this tendency.)  On the other hand, refusing to increase the weight because your perfect form might be a tiny bit imperfect the first time you use the new weight is often silly as well."], [5, "Once your form is good enough not to get you seriously injured, you will make the best progress by just adding weight, getting stronger, and spending more time lifting. As you gain experience with just lifting and pushing your limits you'll be able to iron out the remaining flaws and also find what individual technique works best.\n\nThe only time I'd recommend form before weight is with the Olympic lifts, due to their highly technical nature. Once you get bad motor patterns ingrained it's very hard to un-learn them. But most fittitors don't do Olympic lifts so they don't really have to worry about that."], [3, "Almost certainly.

Caveat, what you see people doing in the gym only tells you they can do at least that much; you don't know their training schedule.)\n\nMost of what people call \"poor form\" is not necessarily an injury risk, but rather, use of mechanical advantage to move more weight.  It is foolish to do this too much, because it makes it harder to track your progress and sacrifices strength training for movement specific coordination training.  (In fact people who aren't very fit but become very good at some exercise that is awkward to perform to draw attention to themselves are an extreme example of this tendency.)

The goal is to replace starchy and sugary foods with low carb, high fiber, high protein, and moderately fatty foods. You lose weight through ketosis. Most people who do low cal diets do lose weight, in the short term. But reducing your carbs, not calories, is a more effective strategy for weight loss. Protein and fat also help keep you feeling full longer. Low carbs helps reduce weight and has other health benefits as I've already stated above (improves blood pressure, cardiovascular health, may prevent or improve diabetes, treat fatty liver disease). If you're overweight or obese and only want to lose weight for a temporary period, go for it and stick to your low cal diet. Any weight loss will temporarily improve your blood sugars, cholesterols. If you want to find a more sustainable and evidenced based approach to improving overall health, you'd cut your carbs. Calories come from proteins, fats, and carbs. Proteins, fats, and carbs each contain different amounts of calories per unit. So if you reduced your carbs, you could replace those cals from more proteins or fats. If you reduce your carbs and start to feel fatigued, it's likely because you aren't consuming enough calories, and need to eat more proteins or fats (note: you still want to try and reduce or avoid high saturated fat, trans fat, or high cholesterol containing foods). Foods like avocados and nuts are high in protein and also high in cals. Can you eat them? Yeah, absolutely. Consuming an extra 300-400 kcals on a low carb diet will still help you lose weight. I'm not suggesting that you purposefully work to increase your caloric intake, but generally speaking, yeah you can eat more calories (good calories, not bad calories). Many people assume that the only thing that counts with food consumption and energy balance is your caloric intake and expenditure... It's inappropriate to assume this in living organisms because different diets lead to different biochemical pathways, which are not equivalent. So the rules of thermodynamics can't correctly be compared. Back in the day, I would count cals (1200 kcal/day). Now, I eat avocados, cheeses, yogurt, eggs, lean meats, high fiber veggies, nuts, fish, you name it. Do I count cals? Nope, but I definitely am eating more cals than I used to. You don't have to limit your carbs to 20-30 g/day like I do, but even reducing your carbs to half of what you used to would make a difference. Or if you want a place to start you could try <50 g/day. It's still important to read labels for carbs, sugars, and the bad fats. There is no ideal weight loss diet yet, but you don't have to count cals if you cut back on carbs, and you'll have an improved metabolic profile in addition to weight loss.

For me weeks 1 through 3 weren't bad, just a little discomfort, nothing worth complaining about. But weeks 3 through 8 were absolute hell.

The goal is to replace starchy and sugary foods with low carb, high fiber, high protein, and moderately fatty foods. You lose weight through ketosis. Most people who do low cal diets do lose weight, in the short term. But reducing your carbs, not calories, is a more effective strategy for weight loss. Protein and fat also help keep you feeling full longer. Low carbs helps reduce weight and has other health benefits as I've already stated above (improves blood pressure, cardiovascular health, may prevent or improve diabetes, treat fatty liver disease). If you're overweight or obese and only want to lose weight for a temporary period, go for it and stick to your low cal diet. Any weight loss will temporarily improve your blood sugars, cholesterols. If you want to find a more sustainable and evidenced based approach to improving overall health, you'd cut your carbs. Calories come from proteins, fats, and carbs. Proteins, fats, and carbs each contain different amounts of calories per unit. So if you reduced your carbs, you could replace those cals from more proteins or fats. If you reduce your carbs and start to feel fatigued, it's likely because you aren't consuming enough calories, and need to eat more proteins or fats (note: you still want to try and reduce or avoid high saturated fat, trans fat, or high cholesterol containing foods). Foods like avocados and nuts are high in protein and also high in cals. Can you eat them? Yeah, absolutely. Consuming an extra 300-400 kcals on a low carb diet will still help you lose weight. I'm not suggesting that you purposefully work to increase your caloric intake, but generally speaking, yeah you can eat more calories (good calories, not bad calories). Many people assume that the only thing that counts with food consumption and energy balance is your caloric intake and expenditure... It's inappropriate to assume this in living organisms because different diets lead to different biochemical pathways, which are not equivalent. So the rules of thermodynamics can't correctly be compared. Back in the day, I would count cals (1200 kcal/day). Now, I eat avocados, cheeses, yogurt, eggs, lean meats, high fiber veggies, nuts, fish, you name it. Do I count cals? Nope, but I definitely am eating more cals than I used to. You don't have to limit your carbs to 20-30 g/day like I do, but even reducing your carbs to half of what you used to would make a difference. Or if you want a place to start you could try <50 g/day. It's still important to read labels for carbs, sugars, and the bad fats. There is no ideal weight loss diet yet, but you don't have to count cals if you cut back on carbs, and you'll have an improved metabolic profile in addition to weight loss.

It's not a super supplement that will magically get you looking like arnold but it helps to create ATP. After creatine enters the body (or after it is produced by the body) it firsts binds with a phosphate molecule to form Creatine phosphate. Now here is where I'm going to lay a bit of biochemistry on you so I'll do my best to keep it simple. ATP (Adenosine Tri-Phosphate) IS the body's energy source. When your body oxidizes carbs, protein, or fat it is doing this process in order to produce ATP. ATP is responsible for driving almost every body process there is. Hell ATP is even involved in creating ATP. ATP works like this... Energy is needed to drive bodily process. ATP provides this energy by hydrolyzing a phosphate group.\n", "id": "cyq9jes"}, {"comment": "> Adenine Tri-Phosphate\n\nIt's actually Adenosine Tri-Phosphate.", "id": "cyqcdr9"}, {"comment": "Thanks!", "id": "cyqcl2y"}, {"comment": "This! Your body removes a phosphate from ATP, creating a burst of energy and ADP (Adenosine Di-Phosphate). Your body then tries to replenish its ATP stores by converting ADP back into ATP through 3 systems. The first system utilizes creatine (phosphocreatine once metabolized in the body) to restore a phosphate to ADP, thus creating ATP once again to be used fore more energy; this is the ATP-PC system. So more creatine = more resources to keep this system going longer. This is the fastest of the afformentioned 3 systems and is always the first used by your body. It has an effective window of 8-12 seconds or so, extra creatine keeping that window towards the high end, which is why creatine is said to help you with those last one or two reps.

I have been progressive overloading, and a lot of my different muscle groups have been improving including my chest strength, what i'm trying to do is really hit it in a way that will maximise how good it will look when I begin to lose all the fat from bulking. My confusion was whether by lifting heavier people mean to go lower reps and higher weights to failure, or whether I should be just adding more.

You *need* to bench heavy, but for the right reason. If you bench the same weight X for a while, you adapt to it and become strong enough that benching X does not provide a stimulus anymore. So you bench X+1 for a while, and then your chest, arms, etc. adapt to let you bench X+1. Then you move on to X+2, etc. Every time you do that little jump, your body adapts, your chest becomes bigger, your tendons become tougher, your bones become more dense. You are training.\n\nSo what they mean by \"*you need a heavier bench*\" is not that benching 315 is magically going to make your chest grow, it's that the process you go through to get to 315 means that you will get the muscular development you are looking for. That is of course provided you put on the work and don't do stupid shit. In the end your chest doesn't depend on how much you bench, it's just that both the size of your chest and how much you bench are caused by the same thing (how much muscle you have), and therefore you can use how much you bench as a reliable indicator of your progress.\n\nFind a program that  provides a good base, e.g. Candito's strength/hypertrophy linear progression, add some direct pec work (e.g. adding some incline dumbbell bench press on the hypertrophy day, some pec flies on strength day, etc.), and then:\n\n1.  **trust the process**: it will work, provided you eat enough to sustain growth, sleep enough to recover, and put on some hard work in the gym.\n\n2. **be patient**: Rome wasn't built in a day.

If i were to adopt this routine, i would change a few things:\n\n*Three triceps exercises (assuming you mean push down, not pull down) seems a bit excessive considering the size of your triceps compared to your pecs. I would alternate two triceps exercises on Mon/Thu so that you do one on each day.\n\n*There is no ab/core work in there. You should do ab wheel and Landmine twists or both. Ab wheel on chest day, L.mine twist on back\n\n*To me, and older guy, this chest volume would be to large (back is good if you alternate the curls on Mon/Thu). But if you were to insist i do all the exercises, i would have to divide it up so that i'd do:\n\nBench, incline, side raise and triceps kickbacks on Monday.\n \nBench, chest flies, OHP and Skull Crushers on Thursday... \n\nOr some other mix of 2xchest, 1xshoulder and 1xtriceps you find pleasing.

Probably shouldn't mention it on this sub, but [I prefer short full body workouts like one of these](http://i.imgur.com/qTwSwuX.jpg) with rather low volume and extremely high frequency.

I'm disproving the idea that fat is more satiating compared to carbs. In other words, if you care about being satiated, there is no need to care about fat in particular. That doesn't mean eat protein until it hurts you.  \n\n>Satiety index scores measure immediate satiety, not long term.\n\nNope. I don't recall the exact studies linked in the review I linked, but I'm pretty sure they look at satiety long time. I'm too lazy to review them atm so if not, I'm linking four other studies to dispute your other point that looks at satiety long term, one of which looks at it up to 24 hours and in terms of subsequent food intake. \n\n>The cited studies probably experimented on a population on the standard american diet. Those people are craving carbs.\n\nThere are three problems with this argument:\n\n1) You're not taking my argument in context. Recall that OP is not arguing for keto. He's advocating for fat>carbs as a general recommendation to the general public. As such, the studies, as they are experiments on the general population, fits to counter OP's argument\n\n2) \"Craving carbs\" is not an officially verified or defined term no matter how much you see it thrown around on the internet where low-carb advocates lurk. This, by itself, inherently makes this argument weak. If you can't define the parameters you argue nor provide proof that it actually exists that makes it weak. Furthermore, the post by npr that looks at \"fast acting carbs\" as possibly addictive. That doesn't prove carbs are addictive in general because that is only a subset of carbs. I've already said that OP's argument overreaches based on this point. Take the two together and your argument is flawed. \n\n3) Thirdly, let's assume that carb addiction is a thing. Where is your evidence that high fat is more satiating when you're not carb addicted anymore? Are you basing it on the low carb/keto studies? If you make a claim, present some evidence. The studies looking at low carb/keto do say that people on this diet generally eat less. There are tons of confounding variables if you're going to argue it's the fat that does it so you can't make that point. The studies in general have two big confounding variables that makes it so you can't say that fat is what is increasing satiety: uncontrolled calorie intake and protein intake. If you look at studies that control for those two factors:\n\n>[If calories and protein are kept the same, high-carbohydrate meals cause equal or greater satiety than high-fat meals, and equal or less subsequent food intake, despite a much larger insulin response \\(4, 5, 6, 7\\).](http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html)\n\nStudies here: [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012), [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12499328), [6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8862476), [7](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10435117)\n\nThere is no evidence at all for the claim that OP makes.

Satiety is a defined word in the english language. You don't need to further define it. Carb-addiction is not an officially defined nor proven term thus it needs to be defined. Huge difference here. \n\n>yeah, and in real life, and in movies, and in the English language (sweet tooth), and everywhere.\n\nSweet tooth =/= carb addiction.

This doesn't support your point at all. \n\n>What we really need is studies that perform the experiment on groups with different diets.\n\nCool, but that's not the point. Also the study does perform it on high fat vs. high carb. I'm not sure what else you're looking for. None of the evidence supports OP's claim. Do you have any?

How do you measure a reasonable theory? I certainly don't think it's reasonable whatsoever. There is zero credibility and there's no reasonable theory to back it up.

This isn't correct. Hip height and arm angle are going to be constant for a given lifter (barring changes in toe angle, grip width, etc). The difference between bar against the shins and bar in front of you is lat tension and nothing else. The same lat tension is hugely important for supporting the upper and mid-spine.

This hip height is dictated by the horizontal position of the bar relative to the scapula and the middle of the foot. Sitting back further from this position won't result in bloody shins, it will result in a bar that doesn't leave the floor. \n\n\"That's a non argument. With such logic, you should not squat or deadlift ever. Because both exercise increase those forces, either by angle or load. Can type more to this.\"\n\nThis is a really good point, and something that a lot of people don't appreciate, so I'm glad you put it down. The big problem, though: we take advantage of the strengthening effect of a deadlift by incrementally loading it, right? We would like to control for all other variables (form, ROM, equipment), except for load. I'd argue that a lifter is going to have a very difficult time keeping the bar, say, a constant 1cm in front of their shins, rather than keeping the bar against the legs. In other words, without touching the legs, we are introducing a factor which will change rep-by-rep, and has a dramatic effect on the shearing force seen by the spine.

You're basically doing what I'm advising.\"\n\nI could push the bar against my legs harder, yes. But this will not result in any more horizontal displacement of the bar.

Let's break down your argument here:\n\n\"Some people say X is dangerous, but we know that X is not dangerous. Therefore anyone who says Y is dangerous is wrong.\"\n\nI hope you can see that this logic makes no sense.\n\nWhen people talk about an exercise being \"dangerous\", it's important to keep in mind risk vs. reward. Is the Arthur press going to automatically put you in the hospital? Of course not. But are there safer alternatives that provide the same (or better) benefits? Definitely.\n\nBreaking down the lift into its constituent parts, there's nothing wrong with the hack squat at the beginning, or the behind-the-neck jerk at the end (note: you should learn how to jerk, I recommend visiting /r/weightlifting if you're interested in getting better at efficiently putting heavy things overhead). The increased risk for injury occurs in the middle of the lift, where you are supporting potentially heavy loads directly on your spine. Sure, it's possible that if you have adequate trunk bracing and move perfectly that your trunk musculature can take most of the load off the spine, but each of those little hops you make to get the bar further up your back is another potential application of a shearing force to your spine.\n\nAm I saying you're definitely going to hurt yourself doing this lift? Nope. But I see no advantage to doing this lift over learning how to clean and jerk properly, which removes most of the risks and keeps the same rewards.\n\nIf you're not serious about this and are just having a laugh, then I change my response to \"awesome work! Heavier next time!\"", "id": "d4eif2a"}, {"comment": ">\"Some people say X is dangerous, but we know that X is not dangerous. Therefore anyone who says Y is dangerous is wrong.\"\n\nI was comparing you to people who dismiss any exercise as being unsafe for no reasons other than their feels. \n\nYou are correct, I should get better at jerking. It's something I am working on. \n\n>supporting potentially heavy loads directly on your spine.\n\nThis is wrong, it is supported by my erectors. It never touches my spine. I have a good amount of fat and muscle there. I wouldn't recommend this lift for a skeleton though.

I have a good amount of fat and muscle there. I wouldn't recommend this lift for a skeleton though.\n\nThe point is not whether or not the bar physically makes contact with the spine. The point is that you're applying a dynamic load in a direction that's perpendicular to your spine. The spine is very good at handling compressive forces, but not so good at shearing forces. The problem here is that this exercise is going to be safe right up until the point that it isn't, and the consequences of that dicey lift could be serious spinal injury. Again, it's about risk vs. reward, which you still haven't really addressed.\n\nI'll leave it at that, because I wasn't looking to get into an internet battle with a stranger today.

Even if you don't have a home gym, stop by to feed your brain and feed your body as I go over topics regarding the two fundamentals of building muscle/burning fat, which is Diet and Training.\n\nI've enjoyed helping some of my friends lose 15-30lbs and now I want to help others who might feel hopeless. The message I preach is one of positivity and encouragement regardless of where you are at and where you want to go. I used to be at a place where I could barely put my own underwear on because of back pain, but now I am able to deadlift 225lbs and growing. \n\nIf you are new, intermediate, or advanced, I want to help you! If you are working out from home or looking to surround yourself with more positive fitness messages, I want to help you! Stop by sometime! :) \n\nwww.twitch.tv/TominationTime\n\n[My bodybuilding progress pictures](http://imgur.com/a/xmiVg)", "id": "d5f3otd"}]]], "47r4od": ["From 216 (fat) ---> 150lbs (lean muscle) in 6 months", "2016-02-26 23:29:59", 14, "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/47r4od/from_216_fat_150lbs_lean_muscle_in_6_months/", [[67, "Your transformation is great but i can't believe this two pictures are 6 months apart."], [56, "LOL fuking redditors are TOO nice.

I don't believe the before and after pic was in 6 months time. I also wanted to say even though the cause is good, I do believe there is an ulterior motive of gaining subcribers for his youtube channel, which isn't particularly a big problem.\n\nThe problem I see is that no one is taking away from OP's success, but people like to gauge their success/progress from others. So when you say 6 months, it makes it seem unbelievable to others currently pursuing the same transformations.\n\nIf you go back and read OP's old post he's been lifting for multiple years, giving tips here and there. Most of his post didn't reflect his views on ketosis, as he was suggesting others to intake way more than 50g carbs a day, which for most people who don't work out A LOT, won't allow them to maintain ketosis. Also you made a comment that it took you some time to reduce loose skin, so that's another thing that stuck out to me.\n\nWhat I truly believe is the pic on the left may be from over a year ago, possibly 1.5-2, where OP talked about getting back into shape (His post history reflects that. Circa 2years ago he was asking for advice). OP started lifting more seriously over the period of 2 years, lost weight over that period and gained a decent base of muscle. This is where OP most like plateau'd for a while, then switched to ketosis which resulted in the After picture, which could have very well been 6 months, but the whole process wasn't in 6 months.\n\nSo from speculation, OP started lifting ~2 years ago. Dropped from ~220 to maybe 180-190 over anywhere from 6-12 months, platea'd, then lost the last 30-40 from a ketogenic diet within the past 6 months. \n\nCongrats on your success OP.

This is after about 5 months of working out."], [3, "When I started I was 15. First day was probably an ugly 95 squat but I progressed quickly and got to 315 in my first year training. Early on I was adding weight every single week. I was at mid 400s before turning 18, and got a competition 535 when I was 22. However, I made very few leaps since then. Right now I'm 29 and my all-time best is 585 and my current best is 545. I'm realizing that getting from 500 to 600 is going to take a lot longer than any of the other steps. I definitely miss being able to add quickly and make big jumps. My advice is be consistent and keep at it."], [2, "I \"re-started\" about this time a year ago. I think 95 lbs. My \"max\" for reps was around 335x8 3 months ago (so 9 months deep). I'm now only doing 315x5-8 because I started to cut and focus more on aesthetics after hitting 335x8.\n\nFor having gotten a lower back injury around that same time, I feel pretty good about that progress. I honestly think I could've done even better but I messed up on too many factors over time (sleep and not taking form seriously enough, mainly). I've been downvoted in the past for agreeing with Mark Rippetoe about his comment that almost all normal men should be able to get to 300 lb squats for at least singles within 6 months of starting to strength train. My experience obviously reflects this. Also, I was cutting from 225 lb to 175 lb during all of this first 6 months while doing a ton of cardio, lacking decent sleep (I slept an average of 5-6 hours/night, tracked by my Fitbit), etc. Things working in my advantage was a diet that was close to perfect, an iron will/consistency of training, and \"noob\" gains. I'll probably get downvoted again, but I stand by this idea. If you can't get to 300 lb squats within 6 months as an average male, something is wrong with your training and/or nutrition.\n\nThe caveat is I did use to squat in college, albeit not very well. I believe I'd do like 225 max for 3x3-5 and thought that was the shit because it felt so heavy. 225x3x8-12 is now my light day."], [2, "Started around 135 for a 3x5, made awesome progress for a year or so.

That was about a year and a half ago, now I only do 135 for 4x12 and do assistance work. Mostly running and erging for legs now."], [1, "When I first started, I weighed in at around 165lbs. I did the All-Pro Beginner Routine starting from 85lbs and then a year later I was up to 275. I don't squat too often anymore (various reasons), so the gain train has slowed down a bit.

I switched from highbar to lowbar at one point early on (around 120lbs, deloaded back to 100 I think?) because I didn't have the mobility for highbar, and recently switched back to highbar since my mobility has improved somewhat. \n\nAs you can likely guess, it's been a miserable, frustrating, and discouraging journey.

At that point my 5rm was a barely eeked out 95kg(209lb). \n\nI took starting strength through to 127.5kg with a few very big resets due to form and injury issues. The resets and form adjustment was all worthwhile though even if it did slow me down.\n\nI moved to Madcow 1 month ago with the intention of getting to 140kg(3 plate) before christmas.

Height/weight, mobility, testosterone levels, physical proportions are all contributory factors. Certainly there is a subset of people where this is a reasonable expectation, but I don't think it's useful to categorize that subset as normal/average...perhaps an adult male of average height/weight could reasonably expect to be able to attain the mark, but that's not really useful for anyone's specific situation.

I never do either and 100% control my body composition at all times.\n\nYou cannot bulk without gaining SOME fat, but you minimize it to almost no fat and as much muscle gain as possible by controlling the SPEED at which you gain weight, ie not gaining more than half a lb per week, because more than that ain't gonna be muscle.  Well noobs might get away with a bit more but still...\n\nAnd then lift to signal the body to allocate those excess calories favoring muscle more rather than fat...\n\nAnd hit enough protein...\n\nThat's it.\n\nBut you cannot expect to do a bulk, gaining weight and lose fat at the same time.  That's defying the laws of physics.\n\nYou commit to bulking for a period of time.  Then once you accumulated enough muscle, you do a cut, to lose weight.  But you continue lifting, exactly the same, to signal the body that you need to keep mass, therefore it will favor dropping fat as the lost weight.  And again you control the speed, not losing more than 2lb per week.\n\nAnd just to reiterate, doing abs or cardio has absolutely nothing to do with it.  In fact I suggest most people don't waste time on abs since they should be building a complete physique with the major lifts, especially at the start.  Abs come from having low body fat, ie cutting as I previously mentioned how to do.  And whether or not you use purely dieting or a combination of dieting and cardio for that is purely preference and the results will be the same.  That's just caloric math.", "id": "cyei6xs"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cyeumyb"}, {"comment": "Well if you are losing weight, that IS cutting.  No you can't.  Theoretically you can at the same time but only in micro-amounts that you can't even notice every day.  It's the NET that matters.  And the NET has to be either one or the other.\n\nYou can recomp at maintenance staying the same bodyweight and trying to recomposition but that will take forever.  And I mean REALLY long.  Whereas you can just bulk for a year, cut for a few months and have a monster base physique already.\n\nIf you try to float in the middle in an indecisive manner you'll just stay the same forever.\n\nIf you're worried about fat, just cut first then and get lean (which it seems you're already doing, except you just seem to have gotten a bit stuck).  Then you can think about bulking after.  And cut again after that.\n\nBut losing weight IS cutting.\n\nAnd there's no rapidly.  Even NOT at the same time it is not going to be rapid.  But at the same time, recomping, It's not gonna happen.\n\nEven with EVERYTHING being optimal and doing an efficient to OCD levels bulk you can gain a few lbs of muscle per year.  If you gain more than half lb per week that ain't muscle.  The body cannot create muscle any faster.  Well you might get away with a bit more if you're a total beginner but pretty much beyond that you're just getting fat.  And if you lose more than 2lb per week that's going to be muscle loss.\n\nThen again depends what you mean by rapid.\n\nYou can lose 2lb per week.  If you call that rapid then yes.  Any more than that you're just sabotaging yourself because you're losing muscle.  And muscle takes YEARS to grow.  Fat only takes MONTHS to lose.  Not to mention having more muscle means you can get lean on more calories because it takes more calories for muscle to exist than for fat.\n\nAnd no, It's irrelevant whether you do cardio or not.  It's preference.  When dieting, only the mathematics matter.  You don't need to do cardio unless you WANT to get some of your deficit from it.  But if you get it all from your diet, the result will be the same and much less time consuming/tiring overall.  I didn't do a single bit of cardio to get the leanest I've ever been.  So cardio is just en extension of diet.  If you dial in your numbers accurately though it is not necessary to do cardio.  Then again even if you do cardio you STILL have to dial in your numbers otherwise you're wasting your time.  So either way, you have to dial in your numbers then choose whether you want to eat a bit less or eat a bit more and add cardio.  I just don't like getting into the cardio trap of having to add more and more cardio to keep results going, especially if you have other things to do in life than working out!\n\nThere's nothing impossible about it, people just don't understand physics and basic logic so they will tell you all kinds of crap.  But I'll try to make it very simple for you...\n\nHere's everything you need to know about controlling the human body.\n\n1) Calories control weight.  Caloric surplus = weight gain, caloric deficit = weight loss, eating at maintenance = stay the same.  This is above all else.  Whether a caloric deficit comes from reducing intake or adding cardio or a bit of both is irrelevant.  So, calories control WEIGHT.\n\n2) Then to control WHAT that weight is (muscle vs fat) is controlled by lifting, protein and speed.  If gaining weight, gain no more than half lb per week (controlled by calories), hit enough protein and lift frequently to influence the excess calories being allocated to muscle rather than fat.  When losing weight, lose no more than 2lb per week (controlled by calories), hit enough protein and lift frequently to influence the body to keep muscle and for the lost weight to be primarily fat.\n\nAnd...  That's IT!  Those are the only things that affect human body composition.  Calories, protein, lifting, speed of gain/loss.\n\nCardio is just more caloric usage.  So it is under the same category as dietary calories.  It's optional how you want to get the deficit.  If you eat the correct numbers to lose 1-2lb per week there's no need for cardio.\n\nThe things like hitting fat and carbs etc., is just for health purposes not to be deficient in fats.  Nothing to do with results.  Diet wise results are controlled by calories and protein.  Calories = weight gain/loss.  Protein = what the gained/lost weight is (fat vs muscle).\n\nSo you hit 1g per lb bodyweight protein (at the very most, no need for more, that's already super safe excess), then fill the rest with fat and carbs by your own preference UP TO the caloric limit.  But of course the total calories MUST be right.  And as long as you get at least 0.35g fat per lb bodyweight in there not to be deficient.\n\nNote: 1g protein = 4 cal, 1g carb = 4 cal, 1g fat = 9 cal so whatever amounts you are on make sure those add up to your correct total daily calories.\n\nGet in some fiber too, in there somewhere, so your guts keep going, haha.\n\nJust because you \"rather\" get them at the same time doesn't mean that's going to happen.  That's like saying I rather be a millionaire from the planet Mars.  But It's still not going to happen just because I rather have that.\n\nAnd yes if you are a total beginner starved of physical activity you may gain a little bit of muscle while cutting at the very start.  But once that's over It's pretty much make your mind up and stick to one or the other.\n\nSo you choose to gain or lose weight, then each process you influence WHAT that gained weight or lost weight is as I told you above.  So if you do it right, each time you bulk and cut you end up with more muscle and less bodyfat.\n\nFor example if you cut and got lean and ended up a certain weight, then you bulk up by 10kg.  Then you cut down again by 10kg.  If you did it right, you will be back to the same weight again but with more muscle.  So that automatically means also with less fat.  Because you are the SAME weight.  So therefore if you have more muscle at that same weight, by default you have to have less fat.\n\nAnyway hope you get the idea now.  Anything else you need to know, just let me know.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1) Calories control weight\n\n2) Lifting, protein and speed of gain/loss controls WHAT the weight is\n\nBased on that logic and common sense should dictate to you how to use those two tools to get any possible result over time.", "id": "cyeuxp5"}, {"comment": "This is so extremely informative, thank you very much.\n\nSo just to make sure, even if I eat the perfect amount of protein and calories (while trying to LOSE weight) AND weight train I can only lower the amount of inevitable muscle loss when trying to 'cut'?

If you cut, yes sure you cannot avoid losing a bit of mass, but if you are THAT on point, the amount you lose will be so negligible that It's not going to be noticeable, so you can pretty much say that you can manage to hold on to your mass while losing weight by being that accurate, yes.\n\nAnd yes I am pretty much saying that you are training to hold on to mass when cutting, not to gain it, once the beginner phase is over.\n\nHowever, It's not as simple as that on a biological level.  But in practical terms yes.\n\nIn fact every day you can be gaining mass and losing mass, gaining fat and losing fat in micro amounts constantly whether you're bulking, cutting whatever.

I believe most Westerners, even ones who are at a good weight, are consuming WAY more daily carbs than humans did in ancient times. Carbs were more seasonal (fruits, harvested grains, etc). Also, humans in colder climates probably hibernated for most of the winter. That's the other thing that throws people off in modern society. We are eating at the same rate, yet we all still go to work during the winter months the same as usual. It wasn't like that in the past.

Seems like there's no consistency in body building programming, mostly because it's entirely based on individual response to fatigue and individual hypertrophy patterns. I think it's helpful to have some periodized program that you follow to a T just to understand how you respond to programming at all before trying to dial in your individual proficiencies and deficiencies. Schoenfeld would be my basis for traditional periodization, and probably Layne Norton if I was doing something more DUP-like (if I decided to start working out like that).

I started with just the weight of the bar, as it takes a bit to get used to the mechanics and balance yourself properly, then just worked my way up. 10KG on each side, 15, 20, etc.\n\nFor me this consists of:\n- Squats\n- Bench Press\n- Incline Bench Press\n- Military Press\n- Deadlift\n- Bent Over Rows\n- Pullups / Chinups\n\nAnd then I'll do more isolated exercises if I feel I need to hit a muscle group more than I did already, such as bicep curls, shrugs, leg extensions etc.", "id": "d2j42dm"}, {"comment": "i should look into more compound lifts, for real. it does sound like what i need.", "id": "d2j9wvw"}], [{"comment": "I'd favour the squats over the leg extension, so hope Friday goes well. \n\nI do squats and DL on the same day in my full body routine, but I know i'm not at my max yet, i'm slowly working back to a pre-injury strength level.

How do female body builders have low percentage body fat while keeping their breasts?  Does this body fat change mean you have to refit your competition suit several times?\n\nHas female body building seen a move towards different looks, much like how male body building now have a \"classic\" Arnold Schwarzenegger-esque category where it values the V-shape look/build over the current \"omg everything is big\" look?

I have implants so I had an advantage there. Some women have to get their suits refitted, but I took measurements at about 6 weeks out to send to the lady who made my suit. I also sent a current weight and a projected show weight. She has been doing it so long that she made my suit just right even though I continued to tighten up over those 6 weeks.

It takes a lot of effort up front, but the maintenance is much easier. Get through the hard part, then never, ever stop doing it, cause it's going to suck to get it back. This goes for eating proper amounts of food AND for going to the gym. Keep going to preserve the habit, even if you don't have the best diet.", "id": "d7008j7"}, {"comment": "My favorite comment here. Thank you!\n\nYes, I'll have to admit that I enjoy eating my family's food because I've always loved my parent's cooking. I'm very fortunate because I've tried a lot of my friend's parent's food, and it did not even compare to the quality of my parents.\n\nVery interesting concept with the plate. How are you to implement the concept with intermittent fasting in which you eat only 2 meals a day? Also, I've unfortunately lost the habit of going to the gym everyday. I used to go 5x a week for a year straight, but I lost it. How would you recommend gaining that habit again?", "id": "d70jpzi"}, {"comment": "You're welcome! There's nothing wrong at all with enjoying food you like. In fact, the thing I like about the single plate idea is that I get to eat food that I like guilt-free because I know by eating that amount of food, I'm taking a step towards achieving my goals.\n\nI don't actually do intermittent fasting or anything like that, I'm trying to lose weight but I still eat three meals a day with several planned snacks in between meals, and a protein shake after workouts. I think if you absolutely must only eat two meals a day, I would try to plan in some snacks to curb your hunger - trying to limit yourself at meal time when you're starving is just really tough. If you can't do snacks, then it's still possible to plan your meals ahead of time, make sure they're well-balanced, and only eat what you plan ahead of time to eat. If you find yourself absolutely starving and you feel like you need a large volume of food, load up your plate with vegetables cooked in a healthy way (steamed seems to be the preferred method). Just avoid sugar, excessively fatty things, and alcohol. Also, drinking water can help curb some hunger, so if you can have water on you throughout the day, that might make things more bearable.\n\nAs far as getting back to the gym, I'd recommend picking a good beginner routine, and just focusing on knocking it out daily for the first month without being too concerned with how heavy you're lifting or if you're hitting each workout perfectly. Just focus on getting in the gym. Build the habit and routine that will become your default. Once you have that, it won't be as much of a struggle getting to the gym anymore, and you can focus on working out harder and smarter. Also, try to work out at a time that fits your daily schedule. For example, I get up early and work out before work because I'm a morning person and it fits my schedule best with traffic.\n\nOne last thing - psychologically, getting back to the gym tends to suck because you're tempted to compare how much you lift now (after not working out for a long time) to what you used to lift at your peak or what people around you are lifting. It can feel really humiliating to lift low weight in the gym in front of other people when you're used to lifting a lot more. My advice is just to get over it and realize that 1) being there is better than not being there, and 2) everyone else there started out lifting lower weight than they do now. No point in beating yourself up over lost time - there's nothing you can do about it and it's not going to be productive. Just let it go and focus on getting back to where you were (and more)!\n\nGood luck!", "id": "d71kzel"}], [{"comment": "Make fitness a priority by making a choice to put it first every day.  Start small, go to the gym on a set schedule and don't miss a workout for a week.  You don't need to finish a full workout, you don't need to lift, you need to show up to the gym and go home as a minimum.  Make the trip a habit and it won't be a decision anymore.  This frees up your willpower to focus on your diet.  Start switching up how you eat, begin substituting portions of rice for steamed vegetables, change from brown sauces to clear, to some rice seasoning/seaweed/dash of soy or vinegar.  Learn to cook with your family, but ask how to cook specific dishes you know are healthier.  Considering that food is a large part of your family culture seeking ways to maintain that bond through learning together may make the transition easier for everyone.\n\nI have no idea how your restaurant works, but at the Italian place I deliver for, the three sons are health conscious.  As a way to introduce their parents to healthier eating they pushed for exploring the viability of healthier options on the menu as a way to broaden their business market.  I understand every family is different but you may be able to spin your dietary changes as an interest in researching ways to add value to the family business.  This communicates your responsibility and investment in the family while accomplishing your goals to change the food you eat.\n\nYou're going to have to sit down and figure out what your ideal diet and exercise goals are first.  This gives you a place to work towards.  Then you look at where you are now.  Then you start asking questions as to why you do what you do know and how does that serve to make everyone involved feel validated.  Once you understand how your family behaviors and culture create validation of individuals you can begin to find alternate, effective solutions that provide both validation and a healthy diet for yourself.\n\nAs always, YMMV because I'm not intimately familiar with your situation and can't give specific advice.  I hope some of this helps you as you forge your path to your goals.

I'm surprised he said no squats but didn't also say no deadlifts at the same time, that's all.\n\nAnyway, thing is, It's a double edged sword, because both those movements can help or wreck you depending how you handle them so I'm wary of advising someone (especially with medical issues) of how to do them without physically being there in person to see how they're doing them.\n\nOn the other hand, I have a brief story to tell.  I did have herniated discs when I was younger.  And though I recovered I had back problems ever since.  Unfortunately I was never given much of a solution by doctors and they just left me to deal with it.\n\nThen when I started to lift and diet properly and knew what I was doing years later, I managed to fix all my issues (including back problems and the tight hams and glutes that were pulling down on everything), as well as shoulder problems.  And I fixed all these WITH my workout programming.  The back problems were fixed by the way I approached squatting and deadlifting.\n\nI was super careful though to build up to them and to be OCD about form.  The thing is, when you become very functional (for want of a better word) in those movement patterns, rather than being incapable of doing them, you can get pretty balanced down there in those areas of the body if you were previously in a mess like I was.  At first I couldn't even squat down with no weight into the correct position!\n\nVery slowly over time I managed to improve though by using mobility work, combined with my programming and attention to form.  I also used goblet squats at the beginning since they're a good accessory to program in the movement pattern of how squat form should be then built up to squatting more on the real thing.\n\nAnyway, the problem is, you're not me, you may have a very different condition to me and it could go either way depending how you handle it so might be better if you have a professional beside you to guide you through it.\n\nI think at the moment though, if anything, I think It's more important to build up to being able to \"function\" in those movements, rather than to progress on them in terms of being super strong.  Even if you do them with an empty bar It's better than nothing and should be able to make you more mobile in those lower body areas.\n\nHow about trying some goblet squats?  Just take them super easy and use the lightest dumbbell possible.  That way it cannot do any harm.  But it will help you learn to be able to sit down into that correct deep squat position with the correct positioning.  And then build up from there.  Just go super light and don't care about weight.  Just literally do it for the movement pattern and mobility and nothing more.\n\nYou can also try squatting with no weight, but with a band around you so you can practice pushing your knees apart.\n\nI think the key here is to be able to have a healthily balanced hip area that allows you to open up the hips and sit down into a squat comfortably with all muscles activating correctly and being balanced.\n\nNot sure if my explanation is clear or helpful, but hope it might at least be useful in some sort of manner.  Don't do anything though without professional medical advice.  And whatever you do, just do with light or no weight so it is easy as hell just for the function of it, until your spinal condition improves, taking it super slow.\n\nAlso, are you doing any mobility work and foam rolling, etc?\n\nI have to admit I have no idea how the shrugs could help herniated discs though.

It's very common that people either under-estimate or over-estimate their progress and development.

One friend of mine whom I've ended up coaching resembles OP a great deal in that he has 4 years of weight training under his belt too, yet he is still absolutely dependent on my help. Terms such as \"progressive overload\", \"hypertrophy\" or even \"volume\" are completely foreign to him, even though he's heard me use gym vocabulary for years in simple and illustrative contexts. He's just unbelievably incapable of picking up information, probably due to him not being interested in the \"theoretical\" side of training at all. (Even though \"volume\" and \"progressive overload\" are very tangible concepts.) As a result he has not really accumulated any knowledge of his own - nothing that he'd be able to apply to his own training at least. His body awareness has also stayed at beginner level. When I cue him to simply keep his back straight, it's an overwhelming struggle for him to accomplish that without fucking up some other portion of the form that I'm trying to teach him. \n\nHe's also a real challenge to criticise. He still does very profound form errors on the deadlift after a couple of years of deadlifting and me having re-taught him over and over again, and whenever I point out to him that his back is severely rounding and hips too low, he gets irritated and responds with a barrage of \"yeah yeah yeah, I know, I know, I'll fix that the next time.\" But the same thing happens the next time and yet again he'll say that he will \"fix it the next time.\" \n\nPeople like that exist. OP may fall into that category to some extent.\n\nI've thought about becoming a personal trainer, because I believe I've already encountered the hardest case out there and cracked it.

Make sure that you take your shoulders out of the exercise as much as possible, so that all the weight is on your upper back, and your shoulders are pulled back and they don't take part in the lifting of the weight. In other words, don't let your shoulders roll forward. There are lots of good Youtube videos on bench press form, look them up and get practising. If this does not help, consult a physiotherapist. \n\nAlso, do you train your back and shoulders sufficiently? Doing too much bench press and similar exercises can create muscular imbalances; when the anterior muscles of the torso (chest, front delt) are relatively stronger than the posterior muscles of the torso (lats, traps, rear delts), the anterior muscles exert more force onto your joints, bones and other tissue even when in rest. This pulls your shoulders forward and worsens your posture, and can - and often will - cause shoulder pain. \n\nRubber band exercises for rotator cuffs can also be of help; if you start to strengthen your rotator cuffs, it can work as rehabilitation if you have a pre-existing injury, or it can make sure that you won't injure your shoulder joint in the first place. I used to suffer from shoulder pain especially after doing bench press, but since picking up rotator cuff training the pain has disappeared. You can look up rotator cuff exercise routines on Youtube.\n\nSo, your to-do list:\n\n1. Bench press form\n\n2. Check your workout selection; is it balanced? There should be at least equal amounts of pushing and pulling, preferably more pulling than pushing even. \n\n3. Strengthen your rotator cuffs.\n\n4.

Do bench 3 times per week, and do a lot of volume. Once per week, push your one rep max. Don't get discouraged. Just keep trying to get stronger. Do more volume than you think you should do. If you're doing 3 sets of bench and call it a day, you won't get results.\n\nDo 4-5 sets of 2-4 reps. After that, do some volume in the 8-12 rep range. You can go beyond that, too. Just make sure you follow up the strength sets with more volume to continue building your chest.\n\nAfter every chest session, do push ups of some kind. If you can't do them straight off the ground, do angled push ups off of a counter top, or some boxes or something. It's easier at an angle.\n\nAlso, stick some shoulder and triceps exercises in there. If you're doing bench 3 days per week, maybe the first day shoot for 1 rep max, second day hit shoulders, and third day hit triceps. These muscles heavily affect your bench press and will allow you to press more, which will also increase your chest strength and size.\n\nLast thing, don't forget to EAT. If you are cutting, your chest will not grow and your strength will stop growing as well. You must eat at a caloric surplus to increase in size and strength. EAT. Trust me. Eat vegetables, eat lots of rice, pasta, beans, potatoes, etc. Eat a ton of carbs. This will fuel your muscles which will improve your strength and performance in the gym. This will lead to gains. Don't worry so much about protein. If you eat enough calories, you will grow in size and strength. \n\nEDIT: One more thing. Get enough SLEEP. 7-10 hours per night is typical for most people.

Of course, if you hit chest Monday and want to hit it again Wednesday, and want to keep a balanced physique you are going to be in the gym 5 hours a day, and still you aren't going to be getting good results because by the time you hit the last muscle group you will be fucking tired from working out everything else.", "id": "d4f0crc"}, {"comment": "this is interesting.  I think every time people overexert to muscle failure they can recover for a long-ass time and keep building bigger muscles.  A long-ass time is like 5-10 days (or 5-15).  But where between 5 and 25 or 35 or 45 days is the point that the body part isn't growing, it's shrinking?  I feel like it should be around 7-18 but I don't know the exact number.\n\nI realize that growth slows substantially.  I'm curious about when it *stops*", "id": "d4f14su"}, {"comment": "I don't think I can give you an exact data point on when growth stops.  What is your goal?  Are you trying to completely target one muscle group, and then come back in 10 days and hit it again?  I think your best bet is hitting every muscle group once or twice per week.  If you want high volume you can check out German Volume, which is 10x10 reps / sets.  I would not recommend hitting say chest, then waiting 7 days because after day 6 it is still growing at a rate of .001%.  Better to hit chest, then hit it again 3 days later, to up the growth from .02% back to .08%.  These numbers are completely pulled out of my ass, but I hope you get the point.  Better to 'reset' the growth period by hitting it once or twice a week than taking 10 days off so your workout can reach maximum efficiency, because maximum efficiency != maximum gains (by maximum efficiency I mean waiting until the exact point muscles stop growing to do another workout).", "id": "d4f1tmg"}, {"comment": "I agree with you!

Is this comment a joke? Muscles growing after 25 days?!", "id": "d4fmafr"}, {"comment": "so reply with a number.  I don't know of anyone who works out once per month.  are you claiming they wouldn't get stronger every month if **on the first of each month** they worked out for 8 hours, every single muscle group exhaustively to muscle failure, then rested for a whole month, eating lots of protein and good macros for a month?  I bet they'd get stronger month to month to month.  I bet they could go from scrawny to built.  Have you seen any evidence or studies to the contrary?\n\nNow obviously I am not saying that this is a good or effective way to get built.  I want to know the theoretical limits.\n\nit's **NOT** a practical question.  Practically, work out 3 times per week with a sane split among muscle groups.\n\nmy question is theoretical.", "id": "d4fo9rj"}, {"comment": "I'm not saying you can't get stronger. A person could lift exhaustively for 8 hours and then grow muscle for 24-48 hours. After a few days the pain would go away (which pain and tiredness are not always a sign of growth). So now the individual is stronger. Great. Could they keep this strength for a whole month if they eat enough and properly? It's possible. People take a month of from the gym and get back in the groove rather quickly. That doesn't mean your muscles grew the entire month or 2 weeks. Only that you are stronger because you stressed muscle. You can't ask theoreticals and expect an accurate answer without testing anyway. To assume because 8 hours of stress was done doesn't mean that you are gonna get crazy muscles compared to 1.5 hours or even 30 minutes of say SL 5x5. You really need to understand how synthesis and repair work.

Approximately 48 hours. It is known. Maybe you just don't like the answer but that is it.", "id": "d4giqrb"}, {"comment": "it's wrong though, because 72 hours after working out you've built more muscle than 48 hours after working out.  it's just a fact.  you can try it if you want.", "id": "d4gm2v8"}, {"comment": "How is that a fact? Have you tested the muscle growth and protein synthesis in hundreds of people? How can I try it? As I said I might be more recovered from the stress at 72 hours but the muscles stop growing pretty rapidly. Actual scientists study this stuff. Or wait, are you a scientist?", "id": "d4grv65"}, {"comment": "> How can I try it?\n\nDon't eat enough protein, so that you end up losing your muscle (your body uses your own muscle protein as a source of protein if you're not eating enough protein).  You're now at Base Muscle Amount (just an arbitrary point in time).  Take a picture, weigh yourself, measure body fat percentage if you can.\n\nFor 10 weeks, do a complete body workout every 48 hours, while eating enough.  Always do your 3 rep max, and track what that max is, and do it on many body parts.  During recovery and every day, ensure you eat enough protein and macros.  Graph your 3rep max over time, from workout to workout.\n\nNow stop and take a break.  For as long as it takes, don't eat enough protein, and wait until you are back to your Base Muscle Amount.  Take a picture, weigh yourself, measure body fat if you can.  Make sure it seems as similar to the first picture you took as possible.\n\nNow for 10 weeks, do a complete body workout every 72 hours, while eating enough.  Always do your 3 rep max, and track what that max is.  Do it the same as the above. During recovery and every day, ensure you eat enough protein and macros.  Graph your 3rep max over time.\n\nBy comparing the above two graphs, you can see whether from workout to workout your strength improved more in the first version or the second.  I can tell you definitively that from one workout to the next, your strength improves more in the second than the first.  I don't know if overall progress is faster or slower.  You can see that by comparing the graphs.\n\nyou are certainly right that this doesn't involve hundreds of people - which is a shame.  How could I involve hundreds of people in such a study?", "id": "d4gssyg"}]]], "4c0owx": ["Self-Promotion Saturday", "2016-03-26 14:02:08", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4c0owx/selfpromotion_saturday/", [[1, "#[Youtube](http://youtube.com/marceloqm96)\n\n#[Instagram](http://instagram.com/marceloqm96)\n\n**Novice Powerlifter**\n\n* 150/92,5/175 (417,5) @73,3kg Meet PR\n* 175/107,5/200 (482,5) @78,5kg Gym PR\n\n19yo | 181cm\n\n-----"], [1, "I am the creator of a unique Portable scoop and funnel for supplements.

Even when I point it out they're like \"oh I didn't notice, I never think of you as short\" haha.  I don't mind though, it has some benefits.  The only downside though is that I get to eat less calories.\n\nAnd to answer your question...  No, not really.  Your body doesn't necessarily turn everything around on a daily basis.  So that's sort of fine, if you do that even if you do it after.  That's not the same as eating eating 4900 in one day though and then.\n\nSaving up 300 per day for 3 days then hitting 2700 instead of 1800 one day is not likely to make much of a difference to anything.  I know, I've done it, haha.  Well I've done it 2 days, not as far as 3.  I wouldn't dare to push it that much.  Especially if you're maintaining.  I've been maintaining since I finished my cut since I've not time to bulk or cut.\n\nWell, it may be a stretch, but.  Yeah I think you could get away with 300 per day for 3 days.  But if doing a compensation thing I'd usually keep it to 1 day before/after to be safe.  You cannot really measure how much you can get away with so It's too risky to go too far out.  And I also wouldn't go as nuts as 4900 in one day.\n\nYou can play with time and play with the math, massaging the limits, but don't stretch too far or it might snap, haha.\n\nBut eating 4900 in a day unplanned (and especially if that is not a calcualted 4900 and is a guess, which means it may not even be right) and then trying to salvage it after is harder.  The body may not turn over literally on a 24 hour cycle, but you can't let the \"playing with time\" stretch on too long either.\n\nOf course there's no concrete answer on this because we don't know the limits of how far this can be stretched and it will vary from individual to individual.  But I'd say if you want to shave a bit off of a few days and stick it on one, that's OK.

(So if you're using chicken breast, the top of it should still be out of the liquid. If you use too much or too little liquid you'll still be completely fine). Cooking liquid can be any mostly-clear liquid. Water, chicken broth, beef broth, beer (though you should cut beer with water if you're doing this). You can also mix any of those with other things, like a can of tomato sauce, soy sauce, bbq sauce, etc.\n* Set your crock pot to high for 4 hours, or low for 8 hours.\n\n* When the time is done, set it to low, and use two forks to shred the meat. It'll be super tender, so this won't take long.\n\n* Once shredded, feel free to add whatever you want. Canned beans, canned veggies and frozen veggies are my usual go tos on this. Add whatever you want, mix it in, and let it cook for another 30 minutes. This step is totally optional - the meat alone is great and can also be used in a number of ways, like on tortillas with some cheese, over rice, over pasta, on its own, etc.\n\nCrock pot cooking is the easiest way to cook food and it's how I got through college. If you're ever worried about those times, like you set it for 4 hours and realize you won't be home for 6, don't worry, it's pretty much impossible to overcook something in the crockpot unless it's like 24 hours. It'll just get more tender.\n\nThis method will help you make big batches of food, so you can eat for days.\n\n", "id": "d21cnef"}, {"comment": "thank you for the detailed comment.

Stop worrying about taking a supplement, there is no magic supplement just eat eat eat.  6-10 reps is a fine rep range for hypertrophy to occur, though you will want to perform multiple sets and keep your rest period between 45 and 90 seconds.  \n\nDocument your weights and document your caloric intake!  Most people need to approach weight gain in a more analytical/data driven manner.  Wanna be on top of your gain-game? Take Pictures every 2 weeks. Measure the girth of your arms, legs, chest, waist and shoulders.\n\nEating:\nIn order to gain 1lb you'll need to add roughly 3,500 calories/week which is an additional 500 calories/day.  Assuming you don't know what your daily caloric intake is, I'd recommend downloading the  MyFitnessPal app, journaling your caloric intake(Side note: don't enter your cardio/weights into your MFP account).  I always recommend to my clients that they eat normally for 2 weeks just as they usually would in order to obtain an average of a typical day.  Once that 2 week control period is over, add the 3,500 calories/week that I mentioned above.  Hold this caloric value for 2 weeks while weighing yourself to note any gains in weight.  Did you gain weight/size? No? Add another 3,500 calories/week.  Do this for another 2 weeks. Rinse and Repeat until you see a gain in weight/size.\n\nYou're a young guy. Typically younger people have a higher metabolism which seems to be the case for you here.  I typically don't recommend large meals before sleeping but because your metabolism seems high and because you are specifically looking to gain weight/size, I would recommend that you eat a large meal before going to bed.  Your body is going to be dormant for hopefully the next 6-8 hours....guess what? A dormant body burns less calories than an active body.  Since you will have just consumed a larger than normal meal just before going into a dormant state, your body is going to store that remaining nutrients.  Drink milk? Go for a cup of whole milk before bed.  Typically eat 1 serving of protein and veggies? Do 2.  Typically avoid some carbs before bed?  Splurge for a small serving or a slightly larger serving of carbs before bed.  Again, your body is going to store whatever it doesnt burn off and thats what you're looking for so eat up. Typical ratios for gaining that I've used in the past are 35%Protein 35%Fat and 30% Carbs.  Everyone is different and (disclaimer) I'm not a certified nutritionist so feel free to play around with those ratios. 1.5 gram of protein per pound of body weight is also a not too uncommon guideline to stick to.\n\nLifting:\n6-10 reps is fine and dandy.  I'd recommend a solid warm up.  Hop on the rower, knock out 5-10 minutes to get the juices flowing.  Let your first set be anywhere from 15-20 reps.  Once you've done your warm up set, get into your 2-3 sets of 6-10 rep cycle but there is a caveat here.  You've got to overload your muscles.  Utilize that buddy of yours as a spotter in order to allow you to put on the maximum amount of weight while keeping perfect technique and that last part is key.  If you aren't fully extending your elbows while hammering out your curls you're hindering your muscles ability to allow blood flow. Blood flow is good for muscle growth.  Keep good technique, keep maximum range of motion and use your buddy for a spot on those last 2 reps before failure.  Lastly, and I've fallen victim to this.... If you do 6-10 reps with perfect technique, excellent ROM but it's not a challenging weight....you aren't going to grow.  Should you get to the 10th rep and the weight is so light that you can get a few extra reps in, don't be afraid of getting in a few extra reps(to prevent this you should document your lifts) but moral of the story is if you are't really struggling on reps 8-9-10 you aren't doing it right.  6-10 reps at some tiny little weight isn't going to magically put on size...it's got to be heavy but for the love of God, don't lift like this loser \n\nhttps://youtu.be/SgPuQnQN58s\n\nI hope this helps.

Stop worrying about taking a supplement, there is no magic supplement just eat eat eat.  6-10 reps is a fine rep range for hypertrophy to occur, though you will want to perform multiple sets and keep your rest period between 45 and 90 seconds.  \n\nDocument your weights and document your caloric intake!  Most people need to approach weight gain in a more analytical/data driven manner.  Wanna be on top of your gain-game? Take Pictures every 2 weeks. Measure the girth of your arms, legs, chest, waist and shoulders.\n\nEating:\nIn order to gain 1lb you'll need to add roughly 3,500 calories/week which is an additional 500 calories/day.  Assuming you don't know what your daily caloric intake is, I'd recommend downloading the  MyFitnessPal app, journaling your caloric intake(Side note: don't enter your cardio/weights into your MFP account).  I always recommend to my clients that they eat normally for 2 weeks just as they usually would in order to obtain an average of a typical day.  Once that 2 week control period is over, add the 3,500 calories/week that I mentioned above.  Hold this caloric value for 2 weeks while weighing yourself to note any gains in weight.  Did you gain weight/size? No? Add another 3,500 calories/week.  Do this for another 2 weeks. Rinse and Repeat until you see a gain in weight/size.\n\nYou're a young guy. Typically younger people have a higher metabolism which seems to be the case for you here.  I typically don't recommend large meals before sleeping but because your metabolism seems high and because you are specifically looking to gain weight/size, I would recommend that you eat a large meal before going to bed.  Your body is going to be dormant for hopefully the next 6-8 hours....guess what? A dormant body burns less calories than an active body.  Since you will have just consumed a larger than normal meal just before going into a dormant state, your body is going to store that remaining nutrients.  Drink milk? Go for a cup of whole milk before bed.  Typically eat 1 serving of protein and veggies? Do 2.  Typically avoid some carbs before bed?  Splurge for a small serving or a slightly larger serving of carbs before bed.  Again, your body is going to store whatever it doesnt burn off and thats what you're looking for so eat up. Typical ratios for gaining that I've used in the past are 35%Protein 35%Fat and 30% Carbs.  Everyone is different and (disclaimer) I'm not a certified nutritionist so feel free to play around with those ratios. 1.5 gram of protein per pound of body weight is also a not too uncommon guideline to stick to.\n\nLifting:\n6-10 reps is fine and dandy.  I'd recommend a solid warm up.  Hop on the rower, knock out 5-10 minutes to get the juices flowing.  Let your first set be anywhere from 15-20 reps.  Once you've done your warm up set, get into your 2-3 sets of 6-10 rep cycle but there is a caveat here.  You've got to overload your muscles.  Utilize that buddy of yours as a spotter in order to allow you to put on the maximum amount of weight while keeping perfect technique and that last part is key.  If you aren't fully extending your elbows while hammering out your curls you're hindering your muscles ability to allow blood flow. Blood flow is good for muscle growth.  Keep good technique, keep maximum range of motion and use your buddy for a spot on those last 2 reps before failure.  Lastly, and I've fallen victim to this.... If you do 6-10 reps with perfect technique, excellent ROM but it's not a challenging weight....you aren't going to grow.  Should you get to the 10th rep and the weight is so light that you can get a few extra reps in, don't be afraid of getting in a few extra reps(to prevent this you should document your lifts) but moral of the story is if you are't really struggling on reps 8-9-10 you aren't doing it right.  6-10 reps at some tiny little weight isn't going to magically put on size...it's got to be heavy but for the love of God, don't lift like this loser \n\nhttps://youtu.be/SgPuQnQN58s\n\nI hope this helps.

On top of that, you get the people who don't understand that calorie numbers such as their TDEE/calories burned from a tracker are pure estimates and they need to adjust based on their results.  If you are not losing weight, then either your TDEE is lower than you thought, or you are mistracking and eating more than you think. The beauty of calorie tracking though is you don't need to be accurate, only consistent/precise. If you eat relatively the same things and often make the same counting/tracking mistake, you can account for it by reducing what you think you are eating.

There are many programs that utilize a squat few times a week mentalitly. I'm sure since you're here in this sub you at least know what the 5x5 is. ", "id": "cybj0g0"}, {"comment": "Sorry but no. I've been on this sub very sporadically so I don't know exactly what 5x5 is.", "id": "cybn8hv"}, {"comment": "5x5 is a lifting program.\n\nAnd yes, squatting 3x per week.\n\nThe reason most people told you to work out like that (body part per day \"bro\" split) is because most people out there have no clue what they're doing when it comes to lifting and nutrition.  And that includes trainers too.\n\nSorry, I'm not being funny, but honestly I don't have time to dig out studies since I'm just helping people for nothing on here.  Folks need to do their own research.  I realize I'm stating points without backup, but they're just common sense and common knowledge amongst folks who actually DO know what they're doing.\n\nThe main point is that a bro split, hitting one body part per day is pointless.  It's the idea people got and spread from copying drug users.  But we are not drug users so, we're not going to get away with that.  That also includes copying from bodybuilding magazines and nonsense like that.\n\nThe point is, when you hit a muscle group, you stimulate it to adapt.  I think we can take this as a given and as the very reason we lift in the first place.\n\nThe point is, after the first few sets hitting a muscle group, you're not going to stimulate any further adaptation.  You're just wasting your time, beating a dead horse.  There's a limit to what you can get from that, otherwise people would just do a million reps or sets and be able to look like the Hulk or Juggernaut within a week.  That's not how it works.  You send the signals for adaptation, but that's done after the first few sets.  So It's totally illogical to waste a whole day hitting a bodypart for 20 sets.  The guys on drugs can get away with it because theire \"limit\" ceiling is higher.  But even for them I suspect they could benefit from being a bit less dumb in their programming.\n\nAnyway, I digress, their world is totally irrelevant to me and to anyone else who is not in it...\n\nBack to the point...  Based on the fact that after the first few solid sets, you've done the job and then you're wasting your time.  And the fact that once you've done that, you can hit it again after around 48 hours (give or take depending on the person and how hard it was hit), it makes sense to create that adaptation, but then stop there and not waste further effort on that muscle group, then hit it again after 48 hour.  Or 3x per week, however you slice it.  So that's why a full body routine or upper/lower split, whatever, is smarter.  Because you hit more (or all) muscle groups just enough to get the adaptation but no more than necessary, then you hit them more times per week instead.\n\nSpecific example:  Let's say you hit X muscle group for 20 sets in one day.  Let's say only the first 2-3 sets were worth doing.  You did 20 sets, but only got one adaptation which you could've gotten anyway by stopping at 3 sets.  Another guy hits the same muscle group for only 3 sets but then moves on to something else.  However, he hits that (and every) muscle group for 3 sets, 3x per week. This means he did a total of 9 sets for the muscle group over the week and got 3 adaptations.  The bro split guy wasting a whole day on 20 sets did more than double the total work but only got 1 adaptation.\n\nThen, if you think about it long term, over a year, the bro split dude is getting 52 adaptations per muscle group per year.  The smarter dude is doing far less work and yet getting 156 adaptations per year.  That's 3x the adaptations.\n\nSo I think It's pretty obvious what this means in terms of results.\n\nAnd sure there'll always be chumps saying \"I got gains from a bro split\"...  Of course they did!  You'll get gains on any program that you progress on.  But the point here is, even if you get some gains, why do more work than necessary for less gains?  When you could've not wasted all that time and effort and done a fraction of the work to get many times more gains?\n\nSo that's why I suggest 3x per week full body, especially for beginners.  Beginners don't even need to be adding accessory work since they don't know what accessory work they would even need and may not ever need any.  They need to progress on the major lifts for at least a year and then IF necessary, add any required accessory lifts SPARINGLY.\n\nBut the main point here is, frequency is everything.  Volume matters but only goes so far...\n\nIf there's anything I did not explain clearly enough, my apologies and don't hesitate to interrogate me further.  And hopefully someone else that has a clue can chip in to verify what I'm talking about, or maybe explain it in a more concise fashion (which is not my strong point!)...", "id": "cybq7t5"}], [{"comment": "Do a 100 squats between them do hip thrusts 100 times too.", "id": "cyb4z7f"}]]], "44bilq": ["Why do I lose more-weight-than-predicted if I don't eat for a day but drink lots of water?", "2016-02-05 19:21:44", 11, "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/44bilq/why_do_i_lose_moreweightthanpredicted_if_i_dont/", [[53, "You will lose water weight on a fast.

I weighed about 197 last time I started a cut (pretty high bf% ~18%) and lost five pounds in the first week at 2750 calories.

Referred to by the term \u201cOlympic press,\u201d the form of this movement that developed over the last few years of its presence in the meet was such that the bar was driven up from the shoulders by the use of a combination of a sharp hip flexion from overextension and a shrug of the traps. Some very adept practitioners could lean back to a point almost equivalent to a bench press, rendering the description of the lift as a \u201cpress from the shoulders\u201d rather inaccurate. An inexperienced or unconditioned lifter attempting this movement ran the risk of a spinal hyperextension injury, although such injuries were not that common: experienced, conditioned lifters had very strong abs.\n\nAnd then from a caption:\n\n>The press was eliminated from Olympic competition due to \u201cjudging difficulties\u201d \u2013 a reluctance on the part of the international governing body to establish and enforce adequate criteria about layback.

That means that fish and eggs, though things like beans and quinoa are good. And make sure you eat a good portion of veggies, since this will keep you full without packing in the calories.\n\nAnd YOU NEED TO FEEL FULL. If you don't, it's not going to work out. For me, this was hard for a week or two, but then my stomach got used to the changes in portion sizes, and I could comfortably fill up on fish and veggies and feel good. Just make sure you find something you like to eat that's not pizza and junk food.

Only 10% will come from exercise, and the other 10% from sleep. \n\nStart your changes gradually. If you drink or eat sugary crap(cake, pop, sugar in coffee) stop that first. Then stop eating deep fried foods. Then move from white breads, rice, pastas to whole grain foods.\n\n A lot of nutritionists recommend the \"happy face plate\". When you eat a meal, break your plate up into three sections. One half of the plate should be vegetables, one quarter of it should be complex carbs and one quarter should be protein. And only eat until you're \"satisfied\"/no longer hungry. Not until you're full. \n\nYour sleeping \"schedule\" sucks. You need to make an effort of getting more than 7 hours of sleep every single night. This will hold you back.\n\nCompound lifts in the gym help burn fat more. Find a good program -1x10 per exercise really is not going to do a whole lot. Stronglifts 5x5 is good and has a fantastic app that logs everything for you. It may take a bit of time but it's worth it. In between workout days, add extra cardio. \n\nFor motivation, what I found helpful was setting short term goals. When I was 305, I set a goal to get to 275, then 250, then 230. Getting closer and closer to each goal really helps motivate you.  ", "id": "d0dpnay"}, {"comment": "Wait, weight loss from sleep? Wtf?

Im gonna do it though (almost wrote gonna try, but that's just an excuse to fail). Thanks for that bit!\n\nAs for the sleep, I have a sleep dr. (Sleep apnea from the weight, I'm on cpap now, which is helping tons with my quality of sleep, it's helped me feel energetic enough to exercise) he says everyone's needs are different and if you feel rested then the amount you get is not as important. That said I have a Meeting with him coming up soon and I will ask him about this again to make sure that I am on track.  \n\nI just installed the StrongLifts 5x5 and am going to try it out. \n\nShort term goals like cross country or bicycling up a hill, just ten more steps, just ten more steps, ....

"], [17, ">not dieting but watching what I eat.\n\nWhat does this mean? To lose weight you need to know *exactly* what you're eating to ensure you are eating at a caloric deficit. Exercising is basically just a bonus before you understand that you need to know how much kcal you are spending per day, so you can eat less than that. There is no other way to lose weight. "], [12, "There's literally nothing in here about your diet, you can do this routine and gain weight if you ate enough. "], [6, ">Non-smoker and not dieting but watching what I eat.\n\nIn terms of losing weight, what you eat doesn't really matter. How **much** you eat does. You need to be consuming less calories than you expend in order to lose weight. You can eat nothing but french fry's and big macs as long as you spending more calories than you consume you will lose weight. It will be terrible for your body, but you sure as hell will shed kilos.\n\nTo lose 10kg you need your body to expend roughly ~~16,000~~ 77,000 more calories than it takes in. This could be reasonably attained over 6 months with a bit of will power. \n\nBased on the stats you gave, you are expending roughly 1800 calories a day, just from walking around/standing/breathing/ digesting/repairing cells in your body. Keep in mind this is just an estimate, and also that the number will drop as you weigh less. If you could maintain a 450 calorie deficit a day you would be 50 kg in just under 6 months. You can maintain a calorie deficit in 2 ways: Eat less calories through diet or expend more calories through exercise.\n\nThat routine will expend maybe 150 calories. That's basically a hot dog worth of calories. As you can see, exercise is not really the easier option of the two. It's not going to get you very far in terms of weight loss if you don't eat correctly. That being said, the routine will have all sorts of cardiovascular, mental, and general health benefits and I recommend that you do it. It may also speed up your metabolism which means your body will expend some more calories naturally.\n\nIn summary, If your goal is to lose weight, you must diet. What you eat is important for your health, but not to weight loss. You have to eat a calorie deficit.

That being said, definitely keep working out, and don't be afraid to lift heavy. The program you are on looks fine as a starter program, but keep educating yourself about lifting.

Anybody making claims more specific than that for a diet is selling something.\n\nSince there is no nutrient that you absolutely need every day (even water, but don't skip that for more than a day), another way to look at it is that what you eat today doesn't matter, but what you eat this month does.\n\nEspecially don't do elimination diets. You can lose weight while eating any kind of food you can imagine. Any food can be part of a healthy diet. There is no reason to punish yourself with food you don't like. Weight (and we're talking fat, not muscle) is entirely a matter of calorie balance.\n\nIf someone tries to tell you that you need to avoid a certain food or eat a certain food to be healthy or lose weight, run screaming and never listen to them again. They don't know what they're talking about. And the more sure of themselves they sound the less they know.\n\nConsult your doctor before starting any weight loss program. You should see a doctor as soon as possible if any of the below are true for you, as it could be symptomatic of a serious eating disorder. There is help for those, and you need to get it.\n\nYou are restricting yourself to fewer calories than your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate). Even for a tiny woman that's going to be at least 1,200 calories/day. You can calculate your BMR using a BMR calculator.\nThere are any foods that cause you fear or make you feel anxious.\nYou are upset or obsessed by numbers like body weight, calories, or nutritional content.\nYou are a teenager who is losing weight.\n\nAssuming it really is safe and appropriate for you to lose some weight, I highly recommend Secrets From the Eating Lab: The Science of Weight Loss, the Myth of Willpower, and Why You Should Never Diet Again to anybody trying to diet to lose weight. Read it if you want to understand the science and psychology behind what I'm about to suggest in this brief summary. The book could easily pay for itself if it keeps you from wasting money on a weight loss program.\n\nDon't diet. Diets don't work. They just cause stress, which is bad for you.\nDevelop a healthy relationship with food, and use smart strategies to avoid having to rely on \"willpower\".\nEat your veggies first. At home, serve the vegetable course before serving the main course. This actually works.\nPut obstacles between you and the foods you know you should eat less of. That can be as simple as moving it out of arm's reach, believe it or not, but it's even smarter to just not have it in the house. Keep fruit around for snacking, for example.\nDon't make rapid changes to your body weight. This is a long term process, and your weight will fluctuate during it.\nGet exercise. Exercise is good for just about everything. Don't work out to lose weight. Do it to be healthy.\nBe realistic about your weight. If you eat a good diet your body will settle in at a weight within a range that's determined mostly by genetics.\nBeing overweight is not as unhealthy as you've been led to believe. Overweight people are not lazy or lacking in willpower. Your weight naturally fluctuates daily, even hourly. Don't obsess over numbers.\n\nOne more note from me: What another person weighs is none of your business. Don't be one of those people who treats fat people worse just for being overweight, or who teases people for being skinny."], [1, "Personally, I am currently aiming to lose weight. My biggest difference from you is that I try to do at least 30 minutes of cardio daily. \n\nI do ~30 mins on the bike or elliptical (try to do at least 10 miles on bike or ~3 miles on elliptical in that time) 3x a week and I box and do cardio 2x a week. \n\nI also am not specifically counting calories, but am watching what I eat more. \n\nCardio a great way to burn calories.

You need to be consuming less calories than you expend in order to lose weight. You can eat nothing but french fry's and big macs as long as you spending more calories than you consume you will lose weight. It will be terrible for your body, but you sure as hell will shed kilos.\n\nTo lose 10kg you need your body to expend roughly ~~16,000~~ 77,000 more calories than it takes in. This could be reasonably attained over 6 months with a bit of will power. \n\nBased on the stats you gave, you are expending roughly 1800 calories a day, just from walking around/standing/breathing/ digesting/repairing cells in your body. Keep in mind this is just an estimate, and also that the number will drop as you weigh less. If you could maintain a 450 calorie deficit a day you would be 50 kg in just under 6 months. You can maintain a calorie deficit in 2 ways: Eat less calories through diet or expend more calories through exercise.\n\nThat routine will expend maybe 150 calories. That's basically a hot dog worth of calories. As you can see, exercise is not really the easier option of the two. It's not going to get you very far in terms of weight loss if you don't eat correctly. That being said, the routine will have all sorts of cardiovascular, mental, and general health benefits and I recommend that you do it. It may also speed up your metabolism which means your body will expend some more calories naturally.\n\nIn summary, If your goal is to lose weight, you must diet. What you eat is important for your health, but not to weight loss. You have to eat a calorie deficit. This program wont help you much with that, but is a good idea anyway.\n\nEdit: Try and include a back exercise like pull ups or rows into your routine.\n\nEdit2: I messed up my numbers", "id": "d0t7hec"}, {"comment": "Not sure where you got your numbers from but I wanted to point out that to lose 10kg you need to burn a LOT more than 16,000 kcals. Losing one pound of body fat requires a deficit of about 3,500 kcals. 10 kg is 22 lbs. That's about 77,000 kcals\n\nOP, sustained weight loss over that long a period of time, especially since you're already starting pretty low, is tough but it's definitely doable. If you want to lose 10kg over 6 months, that means you need to be losing about a pound a week. If you want to be consistent you'll need to make sure that you're eating about 3,500 kcals less than you're burning a week. That means working out your TDEE and then tracking your food intake for a few weeks until you get an idea of where your weight is going. Not going down quick enough, cut more kcals. Going down too fast eat a little more. It's pretty tedious but it works.

If you do heavier weights and lower reps you're ultimately not burning as many calories (intensity) as you would if you were doing higher reps for lighter weight. These heavier weights will help you less in burning fat and increasing muscle but put more stress on your CNS and vice versa for a more hypertrophic training regimen.

It's a very easy program to follow, and in my opinion very fun. You'll be doing 'compound' lifts, which is a fancy way of saying you're activating many muscles at the same time (as opposed to an isolation exercise like just working your biceps out, for example). You'll not only be getting the most bang for your buck in terms of progress vs time spent, but your lifts will increase steadily and you'll see progress not just in how you look but in your numbers as well.\n\nGoogle starting strength, and if you end up giving it a try also google Mark Rippetoe's videos on proper form. That's basically all you need. Dieting is a bit more complicated but a good bet is to try and understand how many calories you consume a day to maintain your body weight. Then eat that much or a bit more on days you lift (which should be every other day), and eat slightly less on days you don't lift to lose weight while building muscle.

Who told you cardio is bad. Assuming you don't have any health issues like asthma or torn tendons/ligaments, etc, why in the hell would cardio be bad for you. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. And yes, lifting won't promote fat loss as quickly as cardio, because you burn mroe calories doing cardio. A healthy mix of both is recommended. If you initially just want to lose 30 or so pounds before you start lifting, you can just stick to cardio for a bit too. Everyone will give you different advice, but it's all the same. Move more, eat less. I was also 250lbs at 6ft tall. Just take it one week and one pound at a time.

You know that you don't have to try to prove anything about yourself, because what is on your visible surface is more of an accomplishment than most people will ever achieve. \n\n**Perks for men:** other men will instantly respect you, women will at the very least be attracted to your body (still need to have a personality and decent/handsome face, and some style). People will maybe be a little intimidated by you, but also maybe feel safer with you around (especially if you also know how to fight). \n\n**Benefits:** you can eat whatever the hell you want, whenever the hell you want to and not gain a pound. You can move heavy objects around without fear of getting injured. You can enjoy an increased level of general health. You can be much improved in the sack.\n\n**Downsides:** buying clothes that fit properly is near impossible.

Just a transient stomach grumbling then nothing. When your insulin resistance sucks you get lighthearted and miserable when you're hungry *even if* you're already plenty fat.\n\nIf I miss a city bus, instead of moping around I sprint and catch it at the next stop.

Juicing is a way for me to drink the nutrients from these vegetables that I don't really care to eat plain, and I actually DO like the juice. I throw 1/2 an apple or lemon in to just sweeten it a tad, and I can quickly get the nutrients from foods I otherwise am not excited to eat. I have less a chance of failing this way, since I'm not just forcing myself to chew on a kale leaf.\n\nI grew up poor and lived on convenience foods. When I began to get concerned about my diet around 8 years ago and realized I needed to change it, and I desperately wanted to eat more veggies. I went pescatarian (only animal protein I eat comes from fish/shellfish) and learned a little about cooking and healthy recipes. However, I still find myself having to cook all the goodness out of the vegetables in order to enjoy eating them. But with juicing, I am able to make fresh veggies a more regular part of my diet, and doing a fast cleanse with them just gives me a big energy and vitality boost and helps me to avoid all my food vices like coffee and sugar. I'm a girl who really struggles with self control when it comes to food and this is one way that I can force myself to be accountable and explore the different flavors of veggies.\n\nMy fast isn't as strict as the word implies though -- I can make healthy recipes with the juice pulp and consume that too so I am not wasting the fibrous content. I can boil the pulp down and strain it to make broth. Etc, etc.", "id": "d3rw3q3"}, {"comment": "Okay. Makes sense. I'm a big believer in doing what helps YOU reduce the chance of failing.

I also can't speak for anyone else, but it has certainly worked for me."], [10, "**TLDR: Eating more fiber and less junk food is great, but the terms here are used and defined incorrectly and the recommendations do not reflect the reality of fat loss, blood sugar control, or general health. Proper explanations are below.**\n\nWith all due respect, while the basic message is correct (get more fiber and less junk food, less added sugars, etc) there are a lot of inaccuracies that are important to understand and correct. Most of our readers don't know enough to make basic correct assumptions that you and I probably can make correctly because we're more familiar with the subject matter.\n\n1) You keep using glycemic load and index somewhat interchangeably.\n\nIt is totally possible to have a high GI and a low GI meal with the exact same glycemic load.\n\nThe glycemic index is a measure of how quickly the carbohydrate from a given source is absorbed in isolation from other nutrients. This is the rate of absorption, and tells us nothing about how much blood sugar changes because it doesn't describe the amount of carbs you consume, only how quickly a given source is absorbed. It is a property of a food\n\nThe glycemic load is the total amount of carbohydrate dumped into the blood in a given time period. It is a calculated number, and is not related to the GI of a food even though the GI is used to calculate.\n\nGL calculation: (GI * carbohydrate grams in a serving), divided by 100.\n\nIf you want  a GL of 7, you could eat 23 grams of carbs from a food source with a GI of 30 OR 7 grams of carbs from a food source with a GI of 100 (like glucose or a freshly baked white potato).  \n**That's a substantial difference in terms of physiological effects, including insulin pulse size and duration, duration of satiety, fat deposition and energy deficit, etc... all from the same Glycemic Load.**\n\n2) The sugar-fiber ratio you listed is also a mess. High GI does not mean high sugar (this term refers to presence of mono- or di-sacharrides), it means high rate of absorption. The type of monomers the starches or sugars are made of also have substantially meaningful effects.\n\nThe problem here is that we could eat 400g of carbs, getting 10g of fiber and 7g of sugars, which would meet your \"perfect\" requirements easily yet also be very problematic.\n\nAt the same time, you could also eat high-fiber fruits and vegetables and end up with 150g of sugar and 80g of fiber, which by your ratio would be a disaster... yet this can be incredibly healthy and improve an entire blood profile (lipids, blood pressure, blood sugar, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, anemia if plenty of citrus and dark greens are combined, etc) while also improving bowel function and colon health while reducing risks of cancer, etc etc.\n\nYour explanation is overly simplistic, flawed, and doesn't reflect how satiety signalling actually works (protein and fat play a massive, massive role in changing hormone, neural, and paracrine messaging that changes teh rate of gastric emptying and thus the true rate of absorption). It also doesn't reflect any of the research regarding which diets work well (anything you can stick to long-term works equally, that's the results so far, with obvious individual variation because not everyone thrives on the same diet) or reflect how fat gain and fat loss actually work.\n\nI know you meant well, and I think the core message of getting more fiber, eating more whole foods, and cutting out junk food is absolutely solid and I am happy to see it being propagated, but the actual test of your explanation illustrates the major problem in the fitness industry: We aren't actually teaching people how things work, or why, and we are using explanations that do not reflect reality or correctly define basic terminology. That can easily be used to create a very unhealthy diet that could be harmful to health.\n\nThanks for reading."], [7, "I never knew that about fibre, thanks for the read.

This is the \"I have a had enough\" signal.\n\n> The battle of obesity is more chemical and psychological than it is mathematical and physical. There is a hormone within every human, called leptin, which regulates satiety in the human diet. This protein has the function of signaling to the individual that he or she had enough to eat or drink. Humans obtain energy in the form of adenine triphosphate from glucose molecules obtained from food. When energy has reached a satisfactory amount within the human system, the hormone inhibits the feeling of hunger, leading to the human ceasing from eating. For individuals diagnosed with obesity, however, the activity of the leptin hormone decreases. When the activity of leptin decreases, the individual falls susceptible to over-consumption. At this stage, a false feeling of hunger sustains, and the individual cannot help but to continue eating. The evidence that leptin becomes dysfunctional only in the state of obesity provides full support to the notion that there exists a catalyst for obesity. In addition, with the number of obese individuals on the rise, this disease is not genetic.

It happens after every single meal. Where else do you think it goes? Once it's in the bloodsteam none of it is excreted (not unless the person has diabetes), so it's all stored or used immediately. Relatively little is burned immediately (unless you're in the middle of a marathon). Some is stored as glycogen but there's a limit on how much glycogen the muscles & liver can hold. All the rest is stored as fat. (edit: well, virtually all the rest. A few glucoses are used to make some other building blocks as needed, like parts of some of the amino acids.) The conversion to fat is triggered immediately (upon eating) by insulin, which stimulates lipogenesis by adipocytes (fat cells). The pathway is glucose -> pyruvate -> acetyl coA -> triglyceride. This pathway is routinely activated by insulin after every meal and is usually complete (all excess sugar stored away) by 2 hrs after a meal.\n\nI'm not in the insulin-is-evil camp myself (fat is useful temporary storage, not the devil incarnate, and it can be broken down just as easily as it's made. In fact it starts breaking down again in about hour 3 after eating). But it's just incorrect to say that sugars are not routinely converted to fat.

But it always will come down to CICO in the end (calories in, calories out). People seem to have best luck with diets that help them maintain control of the \"CI\" part, the calories in, i.e., diets that help control cravings and that you can actually stick to. Which diet that will be exactly is different for different people. \n\nGenerally though:\n\n- hunger usually does indicate you're in the fat breakdown phase. Once you're about 2 hrs past a meal and are feeling hunger, you are losing a tiny amount of weight every time you exhale. (via CO2. The C that you exhale came from your fat). Knowing that that is happening can sometime keep you focused on \"appreciating\" the hunger, appreciating that that's exactly when you're burning fat, and being mentally able to stay in that phase for a little longer.\n\n- generally portion control is most people's biggest weakness. Most people consistently underestimate the calories they eat and overestimate the calories that exercise can burn. Exercise is good (for many reasons) but diet control is critical. (I've always remembered a comment from a running coach that I saw on reddit once, about why some of his runners were still overweight: \"They run five miles a day but they eat ten miles a day.\") So, if the goal is weight loss, don't use exercise as an excuse to eat more. \n\n- 2 overlooked factors: sufficient sleep & avoiding blue light exposure at night. All the hunger hormones & metabolic hormones have strong circadian cycles and hence are affected by sleep patterns and light exposure.

Some of it seems to affect that CI side again (increasing cravings &amp;amp;amp; hunger, making it harder to stick to a diet).

If you eat a meal consisting of excess in all 3 categories (excluding alcohols and all), your body will consume the carbs, where aerobic glycolysis will push the TCA/Krebs cycle forward. Fats and proteins will be digested and stored. Excess carbohydrates will be stored mostly as glycogen and then as TAG/Fat cells.\n\nHowever, this is not always good because these excessive carbohydrates are causing consistent high blood sugar (especially if you dont exercise to activate your muscles and bring sugar down), leading us to the diabetes epidemic we have today.\n\nWhat does it mean for you, /r/Fitness ? Well, as OP said, a low carb diet is vastly more effective than a low fat diet at shedding your fat reserves. This isnt really opinion as much as it is science of metabolism. Low carb causes your body to change the TCA/Krebs cycle as aerobic glycolysis feeds it minimally, so it now must cause Amino Acid utilization(creating muscle loss, albeit minimal as your body doesnt like to lose your gains so easily) and soon after Fat cell utilization and TAG mobilization. This is what the \"Keto\" diet is about - the breaking of fat cells causes formation of Ketone bodies, which after a period of LCHF diet your brain begins to utilize Ketones instead of glucose as its fuel.\n\nWhat is of MOST importance, though, is what works for YOU. It is my opinion that if you truly want to lose your fat reserves than you should cut out all sugars, breads, starches and TROPICAL fruits(banana, mango, pineapples, etc) from your diet and replace them with healthy fat and proteins (apples, berries, etc. Are OK), while also eating at a  caloric deficit to your BMR.

It is uncommon because it is energy inefficient and there is no real need for it if dietary fat intake is sufficient.\n\nWhat actually matters however is triglyceride synthesis. Triglycerides are the main component of adipose tissue and lipoproteins. They are made of a glycerol backbone, and three fatty acids.\n\nDietary carbohydrates encourage triglyceride synthesis by providing glucose for the synthesis of the glycerol backbone, and also fatty acids by inhibiting beta oxidation.\n\nSo yes, sugar does turn into fat. Fat in this context being triglycerides rather than fatty acids.\n\n----\n\nTriglyceride synthesis happens in both adipose tissue and the liver. My knowledge is spotty on the former, so I will focus on the latter.\n\nWhen liver glycogen is full, and serum glucose is elevated, the liver can no longer store incoming glucose in glycogen, so it creates triglycerides instead, which are then exported as VLDL, which later becomes LDL.\n\nIf you want good LDL-P levels, you have to prevent liver glycogen from becoming full, plain and simple.\n\n----\n\nKetogenic diets are a nice way to lower triglycerides. Since dietary carbohydrate intake is only 20-50 grams, it can not cover the absolute requirement for glucose. Thus the body catabolizes triglycerides to create glucose from their glycerol backbone, and ketones from fatty acids as a \"side effect\".\n\nIt is also possible to keep total carbohydrate intake under 120 grams, or the approximate capacity of liver glycogen, so the liver hopefully will not convert glucose into triglycerides.\n\nAnother approach is to only consume low glycemic index sources of carbohydrates, hoping that your glucose usage, and glycogen depletion rate outpaces your intake.\n\nYet another approach is to time your carbohydrate intake around exercise so it preferentially goes to fuel your muscles and muscle glycogen rather than liver glycogen.\n\nYet yet another approach is to decrease fat intake to such low levels that there is simply not enough fatty acids for triglyceride synthesis.\n", "id": "cz46jfn"}], [{"comment": "At one point in my life, I had a cholestrol level of 290.

Proper explanations are below.**\n\nWith all due respect, while the basic message is correct (get more fiber and less junk food, less added sugars, etc) there are a lot of inaccuracies that are important to understand and correct. Most of our readers don't know enough to make basic correct assumptions that you and I probably can make correctly because we're more familiar with the subject matter.\n\n1) You keep using glycemic load and index somewhat interchangeably.\n\nIt is totally possible to have a high GI and a low GI meal with the exact same glycemic load.\n\nThe glycemic index is a measure of how quickly the carbohydrate from a given source is absorbed in isolation from other nutrients. This is the rate of absorption, and tells us nothing about how much blood sugar changes because it doesn't describe the amount of carbs you consume, only how quickly a given source is absorbed. It is a property of a food\n\nThe glycemic load is the total amount of carbohydrate dumped into the blood in a given time period. It is a calculated number, and is not related to the GI of a food even though the GI is used to calculate.\n\nGL calculation: (GI * carbohydrate grams in a serving), divided by 100.\n\nIf you want  a GL of 7, you could eat 23 grams of carbs from a food source with a GI of 30 OR 7 grams of carbs from a food source with a GI of 100 (like glucose or a freshly baked white potato).  \n**That's a substantial difference in terms of physiological effects, including insulin pulse size and duration, duration of satiety, fat deposition and energy deficit, etc... all from the same Glycemic Load.**\n\n2) The sugar-fiber ratio you listed is also a mess. High GI does not mean high sugar (this term refers to presence of mono- or di-sacharrides), it means high rate of absorption. The type of monomers the starches or sugars are made of also have substantially meaningful effects.\n\nThe problem here is that we could eat 400g of carbs, getting 10g of fiber and 7g of sugars, which would meet your \"perfect\" requirements easily yet also be very problematic.\n\nAt the same time, you could also eat high-fiber fruits and vegetables and end up with 150g of sugar and 80g of fiber, which by your ratio would be a disaster... yet this can be incredibly healthy and improve an entire blood profile (lipids, blood pressure, blood sugar, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, anemia if plenty of citrus and dark greens are combined, etc) while also improving bowel function and colon health while reducing risks of cancer, etc etc.\n\nYour explanation is overly simplistic, flawed, and doesn't reflect how satiety signalling actually works (protein and fat play a massive, massive role in changing hormone, neural, and paracrine messaging that changes teh rate of gastric emptying and thus the true rate of absorption). It also doesn't reflect any of the research regarding which diets work well (anything you can stick to long-term works equally, that's the results so far, with obvious individual variation because not everyone thrives on the same diet) or reflect how fat gain and fat loss actually work.\n\nI know you meant well, and I think the core message of getting more fiber, eating more whole foods, and cutting out junk food is absolutely solid and I am happy to see it being propagated, but the actual test of your explanation illustrates the major problem in the fitness industry: We aren't actually teaching people how things work, or why, and we are using explanations that do not reflect reality or correctly define basic terminology.

This is the \"I have a had enough\" signal.\n\n> The battle of obesity is more chemical and psychological than it is mathematical and physical. There is a hormone within every human, called leptin, which regulates satiety in the human diet. This protein has the function of signaling to the individual that he or she had enough to eat or drink. Humans obtain energy in the form of adenine triphosphate from glucose molecules obtained from food. When energy has reached a satisfactory amount within the human system, the hormone inhibits the feeling of hunger, leading to the human ceasing from eating. For individuals diagnosed with obesity, however, the activity of the leptin hormone decreases. When the activity of leptin decreases, the individual falls susceptible to over-consumption. At this stage, a false feeling of hunger sustains, and the individual cannot help but to continue eating. The evidence that leptin becomes dysfunctional only in the state of obesity provides full support to the notion that there exists a catalyst for obesity. In addition, with the number of obese individuals on the rise, this disease is not genetic.

Just dont worry about it for 3-4 months, get to your goal weight, then worry about mass."], [2, "I've done this before. I'm doing it right now. It's counterintuitive but it's bullshit to say it's not possible. I was 109kg, wanted to lose weight. While doing cardio and controlling my food like every other schmuck, I got interested in resistance training. Eventually I switched over and haven't looked back.\n\n1. Food. You'll be ~~wanting~~ needing 200grams+ of protein every day, making sure to take a good Whey Protein Isolate before and after the gym. I add 5grams of creatine to my shake pre-gym, once/day, and I do take it on off days (it needs to stay in your muscles). It does make a difference, but it doesn't work straight away. Give it a few weeks to start to saturate your muscles. Consume the majority of your carbs earlier in the day, not later, and aim for between 160-200grams. Obviously try to avoid sugars. Fats - you need them. Don't cut them out, but I don't go over 50grams/day when cutting *and* bulking.\n\n2. Cardio - use for warm ups (5 mins) pre lifting. You don't want to see cardio eating your muscle gains, which it will, unless you're highly scientific about when and what, which seems unlikely. Control your fat loss with your food, not with cardio. Step away from the treadmill, unless you absolutely need it for fitness or endorphins. But it will not help with cutting and putting on muscle at the same time.\n\n3. Weights - aim for hypertrophy, not strength. That is, keep it around 3 and 4 sets of 8-12 reps, minimal rest time, go for at least an hour. Don't sit there on your phone. Make sure you give due time to the best exercises of the lot - deadlifts, squats, bench press (dumbbell or barbell, doesn't really matter) and overhead press. You can give your arms some love too but bicep curls and tricep pulldowns are not a heavily taxing regime - the ones I mentioned are hard work and will give you a far greater workout. Work out your splits and stick to it. I do 1. chest/back/abs. 2. shoulders/calves. 3. arms/abs. 4. legs. Do not skip leg day. Do not skip squats or deadlifts. They will build strength, which you will otherwise lose when you're in calorie deficit. \n\nOnce you hit your goal weight, you'll need to rejig your macro intake, introduce more carbs and fat (but carefully) and taper off from the protein intake. Don't forget as you lose weight, your BMR will decrease as well.\n\nYou're going to feel tired at times. You'll need quality sleep. I did all of this with a baby boy waking me up half the time and it was hell, but eventually my body just fucking started gaining shape and losing fat and doing its own thing. It's called training for a reason. Train your body to eat x amount. Train it to lift, train it to operate on an energy shortage but still give it enough fuel to maintain and *grow* muscle. \n\nI've lost 26 kilograms doing this, yet I've managed to maintain muscle shape, tone it up and get stronger, and I've actually enjoyed it.

It's counterintuitive but it's bullshit to say it's not possible. I was 109kg, wanted to lose weight. While doing cardio and controlling my food like every other schmuck, I got interested in resistance training. Eventually I switched over and haven't looked back.\n\n1. Food. You'll be ~~wanting~~ needing 200grams+ of protein every day, making sure to take a good Whey Protein Isolate before and after the gym. I add 5grams of creatine to my shake pre-gym, once/day, and I do take it on off days (it needs to stay in your muscles). It does make a difference, but it doesn't work straight away. Give it a few weeks to start to saturate your muscles. Consume the majority of your carbs earlier in the day, not later, and aim for between 160-200grams. Obviously try to avoid sugars. Fats - you need them. Don't cut them out, but I don't go over 50grams/day when cutting *and* bulking.\n\n2. Cardio - use for warm ups (5 mins) pre lifting. You don't want to see cardio eating your muscle gains, which it will, unless you're highly scientific about when and what, which seems unlikely. Control your fat loss with your food, not with cardio. Step away from the treadmill, unless you absolutely need it for fitness or endorphins. But it will not help with cutting and putting on muscle at the same time.\n\n3. Weights - aim for hypertrophy, not strength. That is, keep it around 3 and 4 sets of 8-12 reps, minimal rest time, go for at least an hour. Don't sit there on your phone. Make sure you give due time to the best exercises of the lot - deadlifts, squats, bench press (dumbbell or barbell, doesn't really matter) and overhead press. You can give your arms some love too but bicep curls and tricep pulldowns are not a heavily taxing regime - the ones I mentioned are hard work and will give you a far greater workout. Work out your splits and stick to it. I do 1. chest/back/abs. 2. shoulders/calves. 3. arms/abs. 4. legs. Do not skip leg day. Do not skip squats or deadlifts. They will build strength, which you will otherwise lose when you're in calorie deficit. \n\nOnce you hit your goal weight, you'll need to rejig your macro intake, introduce more carbs and fat (but carefully) and taper off from the protein intake. Don't forget as you lose weight, your BMR will decrease as well.\n\nYou're going to feel tired at times. You'll need quality sleep. I did all of this with a baby boy waking me up half the time and it was hell, but eventually my body just fucking started gaining shape and losing fat and doing its own thing. It's called training for a reason. Train your body to eat x amount. Train it to lift, train it to operate on an energy shortage but still give it enough fuel to maintain and *grow* muscle. \n\nI've lost 26 kilograms doing this, yet I've managed to maintain muscle shape, tone it up and get stronger, and I've actually enjoyed it. I eat enough. I work out enough. I don't get tired any more. I'm focused and alert, and I'm all business in the gym. I still have some fat around my belly that is slowly coming off (men!).

The largest contributor to hypertrophy is accumulated volume and relative volume over time. More volume can be achieved numerous different ways (adding sets, smaller weight jumps, adding reps with the same weight, etc.), but relative volume is something no one ever really factors in.

Is eccentric training as effective for both slow and fast twitch muscles. \n\n- This last question is a bit of a personal one: I have historically been more of an endurance athlete and for the past year have been focusing on high rep ranges; 15+ reps for compounds along with tons of bodyweight or lightweight circuits at very high reps (hundreds of jump squats for instance). About three weeks ago I decided I wanted to transition and get bigger and stronger but not to lose my endurance. I am doing 3x10 for most of my lifts. 1) I suppose my goal is for myofibrilar hypertrophy but if possible with a focus on slow twitch fibers - what type of set and rep ranges would you recommend (how mutually exclusive are my goals?), 2) what kind of rep ranges build endurance, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, myofibrillar hypertrophy?\n\nI found the article pretty interesting, thanks for sharing and for any answers you can give me. \n\n-EDIT: At the end of the article you talk about slower addition of muscle mass based on how long you've been training; if early on you build sarcoplasm, over time can you \"convert\" that to myofibrils? or will it be harder to build myofibrils as your muscles are already bigger with sarcoplasm?\n\n", "id": "d1s2o6c"}, {"comment": "Glad you liked it!\n\n\n1) Training higher reps increases the amount of non-contractle fluid within a muscle (consisting of compunds like water, glycogen, minerals, salts, etc) but at the same time also increases the slow twitch fibers. Slow twitch fibers, however, have less potential for muscle growth and thereby the ratio to non-contractile vs contractile hypertrophy is more toward non-contractile.\n\n\n2) Creatine has more to do with energy supply. Do you still know the ATP production from biology classes? Creatine is a molecule that can be broken down very fast when the ATP reserve within a muscle fiber is low\n\n\n3) As far as I know; Yes.\n\n\n4) Building myofibrilar hypertrophy and slow twitch fibers is a bit contradictory. Also keep in mind that it is not possible to ''isolate'' one type of hypertrophy. You will ALWAYS develop both, you can only shift the tendency more towards one.

You have a shock phase where strength gains that are occurring arent due to muscle changes but neurological adaptations.

All my lifts soared through the roof. Instead of adding 10lbs to my squat per week I was adding 30. My bench went up. I had more visible gains in my frame.

Doing SL for a months should add at least 30 pounds to all your lifts and probably 60 pounds to your squats. In a little over 3 months, you should have added about 100 lbs to all of your lifts.\n\nIf progress to you is looking like a bodybuilder, then no, you won't look that way after a month. It takes most guys several months if not years to build a physique like that. \n\n> he stated that beginners should start doing volume training to exhaustion before starting strength related, less volume oriented training\n\nThere are a few things wrong with this. First off, 5x5 isn't really considered low volume, it's moderate volume. It's similar to doing 3x8 or 3x10, both popular bodybuilding rep schemes. Many strength programs have you working in the realm of 3x5, 3x3, or even just several heavy singles.\n\nYou also have to remember that the compound exercises are getting you more bang for your buck. Many bodybuilding routines do a lot of isolation work (i.e. chest fly, pull downs, and crunches) for sets of 3x10. You work all of these muscles when doing a bench press for 5 sets of 5 because it's a compound movement. Squats work pretty much your entire body, deadlifts hit your entire posterior chain, rows work your biceps, back, and core, etc.\n\nAlso, the reason you don't want a beginner to work to exhaustion is because their form will start to deteriorate once they fatigue. This can lead to injuries or simply inefficient movements. These are both things that should be avoided at all costs.\n\nFinally, there is lots of research that shows compound movements are more beneficial to natural lifters because holding heavy ass weight, especially on your squats, causes your body to react by releasing HGH and testosterone, two supremely important things to building muscle.\n\nJust because someone has a PhD doesn't mean they're right. Just because I'm typing on Reddit doesn't mean I'm right. But from all the anectodal stories I've read (not exactly scientific, but c'est la vie), most people get the best results when starting on a strength program like SL 5x5 and then switching to a hypertrophy program when they start to plateau.

The reason being the exact reasons you suggest. See, muscle morphology isnt something youre going to see right away (Han Seyle). You have a shock phase where strength gains that are occurring arent due to muscle changes but neurological adaptations. This means increased motor unit recruitment and synch patterns, increased CNS activation and reduced autogenic inhibition effects which allow for greater force production. If someone were to jump right into strength training what they'd be doing is ignoring the facts, and putting their body under unnecessary stress and risk of injury when their body isnt on the same page as their goals. This leads to all kinds of other forms of injury, and leads to muscle imbalances, synergistic dominance, and reduced functional movement.

Squatting 5x5 3 times a week. No one I knew squatted more than once per week. Anyway my lifting buddy gave me an ultimatum that I could do it with him or find a new lifting partner. All my lifts soared through the roof. Instead of adding 10lbs to my squat per week I was adding 30. My bench went up. I had more visible gains in my frame.

", "id": "d1bxx25"}], [{"comment": "> Hey guys I've been doing the stronglifts 5x5 for less than a month now and have seen very little progress\n\nDefine progress. Doing SL for a months should add at least 30 pounds to all your lifts and probably 60 pounds to your squats. In a little over 3 months, you should have added about 100 lbs to all of your lifts.\n\nIf progress to you is looking like a bodybuilder, then no, you won't look that way after a month. It takes most guys several months if not years to build a physique like that. \n\n> he stated that beginners should start doing volume training to exhaustion before starting strength related, less volume oriented training\n\nThere are a few things wrong with this. First off, 5x5 isn't really considered low volume, it's moderate volume. It's similar to doing 3x8 or 3x10, both popular bodybuilding rep schemes. Many strength programs have you working in the realm of 3x5, 3x3, or even just several heavy singles.\n\nYou also have to remember that the compound exercises are getting you more bang for your buck. Many bodybuilding routines do a lot of isolation work (i.e. chest fly, pull downs, and crunches) for sets of 3x10. You work all of these muscles when doing a bench press for 5 sets of 5 because it's a compound movement. Squats work pretty much your entire body, deadlifts hit your entire posterior chain, rows work your biceps, back, and core, etc.\n\nAlso, the reason you don't want a beginner to work to exhaustion is because their form will start to deteriorate once they fatigue. This can lead to injuries or simply inefficient movements. These are both things that should be avoided at all costs.\n\nFinally, there is lots of research that shows compound movements are more beneficial to natural lifters because holding heavy ass weight, especially on your squats, causes your body to react by releasing HGH and testosterone, two supremely important things to building muscle.\n\nJust because someone has a PhD doesn't mean they're right. Just because I'm typing on Reddit doesn't mean I'm right. But from all the anectodal stories I've read (not exactly scientific, but c'est la vie), most people get the best results when starting on a strength program like SL 5x5 and then switching to a hypertrophy program when they start to plateau.

As you\u2019ll see, that\u2019s what Bigger Leaner Stronger is all about: pushing, pulling, raising, and squatting barbells and dumbbells.\n\n>There are studies out there comparing machines and free weights that are often used to disagree with this approach. If you took these studies at face value, you could easily conclude that machines are equally effective as free weights for building muscle and strength and possibly even better. \n\n>The people who do this are missing a couple of crucial pieces of information: \n\n>The subjects in these studies are untrained, and the results seen in untrained subjects simply can\u2019t be directly extrapolated to trained subjects. \n\n>\u201cNewbie gains\u201d are very real and boil down to the simple fact that your muscles respond exceptionally well to just about any type of training for the first three to six months. Simply put, you can make all kinds of mistakes in the beginning and still make better-than-average progress. \n\n>This doesn\u2019t last long, though. Once the \u201cmagic\u201d runs out, it\u2019s gone forever, and what worked for the first few months won\u2019t necessarily continue to work. \n\n>This is especially true in resistance training. While an untrained subject can make mediocre strength and muscle gains on machines for the first few months, there\u2019s no way in hell he can build an impressive physique by primarily working on machines.\n\n>There is research that proves the opposite: free weights are indeed more effective at building muscle and strength than machines. \n\n>A good example is a study conducted by researchers from the University of Saskatchewan, which demonstrated that the free weight squat resulted in 43 percent more leg muscle activation than the Smith machine squat. 1 \n\n>Another example is a study conducted by researchers from the University of California that demonstrated that the free weight bench press resulted in greater activation of the upper-body muscles than the Smith machine bench press. 2 \n\n>These things shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. For decades, the most impressive bodybuilders have always emphasized free weight training, and I\u2019ll bet that the biggest, strongest guys in your gym do the same. \n\n>The bottom line is that there\u2019s just something special about forcing the body to freely manipulate weight, unaided, against the pull of gravity. Nobody ever built a great chest by just pounding away on the pec deck and machine press: it always took years of pushing around barbells and dumbbells. \n\n>Not all free weight exercises are equal, though. The most effective ones are known as compound exercises, and they involve and activate multiple muscle groups. Examples of powerful compound exercises are the squat, deadlift, and bench press, which train a lot more than just the legs, back, and chest, respectively. \n\n>The opposite of a compound exercise is an isolation exercise, which primarily involves and activates just one muscle group. Examples of isolation exercises are the cable fly (which isolates the chest muscles), dumbbell curl (which isolates the biceps), and leg extension (which isolates the quadriceps). \n\n>When it comes to building size and strength, numerous scientific studies have confirmed the superiority of compound exercises over isolation exercises. \n\n>One such study was conducted at Ball State University in 2000, and it went like this: Two groups of men trained with weights for 10 weeks. The first group did four compound upper-body exercises, while the second group did the same plus bicep curls and triceps extensions (isolation exercises). 3 \n\n>After the training period, both groups increased strength and size, but which do you think had bigger arms? The answer is neither. The additional isolation training performed by group two produced no additional effect on arm strength or circumference. The takeaway isn\u2019t that you shouldn\u2019t directly train your arms, but rather that by overloading your entire body, you cause everything to grow. \n\n>Charles Poliquin, trainer to world-class athletes like Olympians and professional sports players, is fond of saying that to gain an inch on your arms, you have to gain 10 pounds of muscle. \n\n>His point is that the most effective way to build a big, strong body is with systemic overload, not localized training. If your weightlifting program isn\u2019t built around heavy, compound training, you\u2019re never going to achieve your genetic potential in terms of overall muscle size and strength. \n\n>Now, I\u2019m not saying that all isolation exercises are worthless. Certain isolation exercises, if properly incorporated into a routine, do help with overall development. In fact, they\u2019re necessary for fully developing smaller muscles in the body like the shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n>So you will find a few isolation exercises in my program, but they are hardly the emphasis.\n\nMatthews, Michael.

The basic idea is that you commit this time to strength training then after you run stronglifts through you switch to something more specific.", "id": "d5423tl"}], [{"comment": ">*MYTH & MISTAKE #3: WASTING TIME WITH THE WRONG EXERCISES*\n\n>Most of what your gym offers in terms of workout machines and contraptions has no place in a proper weightlifting routine. \n\n>As the well-known strength coach and author Mark Rippetoe says, if you want to be strong, ditch the machines and pick up a barbell. As you\u2019ll see, that\u2019s what Bigger Leaner Stronger is all about: pushing, pulling, raising, and squatting barbells and dumbbells.\n\n>There are studies out there comparing machines and free weights that are often used to disagree with this approach. If you took these studies at face value, you could easily conclude that machines are equally effective as free weights for building muscle and strength and possibly even better. \n\n>The people who do this are missing a couple of crucial pieces of information: \n\n>The subjects in these studies are untrained, and the results seen in untrained subjects simply can\u2019t be directly extrapolated to trained subjects. \n\n>\u201cNewbie gains\u201d are very real and boil down to the simple fact that your muscles respond exceptionally well to just about any type of training for the first three to six months. Simply put, you can make all kinds of mistakes in the beginning and still make better-than-average progress. \n\n>This doesn\u2019t last long, though. Once the \u201cmagic\u201d runs out, it\u2019s gone forever, and what worked for the first few months won\u2019t necessarily continue to work. \n\n>This is especially true in resistance training. While an untrained subject can make mediocre strength and muscle gains on machines for the first few months, there\u2019s no way in hell he can build an impressive physique by primarily working on machines.\n\n>There is research that proves the opposite: free weights are indeed more effective at building muscle and strength than machines. \n\n>A good example is a study conducted by researchers from the University of Saskatchewan, which demonstrated that the free weight squat resulted in 43 percent more leg muscle activation than the Smith machine squat. 1 \n\n>Another example is a study conducted by researchers from the University of California that demonstrated that the free weight bench press resulted in greater activation of the upper-body muscles than the Smith machine bench press. 2 \n\n>These things shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. For decades, the most impressive bodybuilders have always emphasized free weight training, and I\u2019ll bet that the biggest, strongest guys in your gym do the same. \n\n>The bottom line is that there\u2019s just something special about forcing the body to freely manipulate weight, unaided, against the pull of gravity. Nobody ever built a great chest by just pounding away on the pec deck and machine press: it always took years of pushing around barbells and dumbbells. \n\n>Not all free weight exercises are equal, though. The most effective ones are known as compound exercises, and they involve and activate multiple muscle groups. Examples of powerful compound exercises are the squat, deadlift, and bench press, which train a lot more than just the legs, back, and chest, respectively. \n\n>The opposite of a compound exercise is an isolation exercise, which primarily involves and activates just one muscle group. Examples of isolation exercises are the cable fly (which isolates the chest muscles), dumbbell curl (which isolates the biceps), and leg extension (which isolates the quadriceps). \n\n>When it comes to building size and strength, numerous scientific studies have confirmed the superiority of compound exercises over isolation exercises. \n\n>One such study was conducted at Ball State University in 2000, and it went like this: Two groups of men trained with weights for 10 weeks. The first group did four compound upper-body exercises, while the second group did the same plus bicep curls and triceps extensions (isolation exercises). 3 \n\n>After the training period, both groups increased strength and size, but which do you think had bigger arms? The answer is neither. The additional isolation training performed by group two produced no additional effect on arm strength or circumference. The takeaway isn\u2019t that you shouldn\u2019t directly train your arms, but rather that by overloading your entire body, you cause everything to grow. \n\n>Charles Poliquin, trainer to world-class athletes like Olympians and professional sports players, is fond of saying that to gain an inch on your arms, you have to gain 10 pounds of muscle. \n\n>His point is that the most effective way to build a big, strong body is with systemic overload, not localized training. If your weightlifting program isn\u2019t built around heavy, compound training, you\u2019re never going to achieve your genetic potential in terms of overall muscle size and strength. \n\n>Now, I\u2019m not saying that all isolation exercises are worthless. Certain isolation exercises, if properly incorporated into a routine, do help with overall development. In fact, they\u2019re necessary for fully developing smaller muscles in the body like the shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n>So you will find a few isolation exercises in my program, but they are hardly the emphasis.\n\nMatthews, Michael.

That equates to about 80 to 135 grams in a 165-pound adult. Oliver C. Witard, exercise metabolism researcher at the University of Stirling in Scotland, advises consuming even more, namely those trying to hit new PRs.\n\n**\u201cFor athletes seeking optimum performance, a recommendation of 1.6 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight may be beneficial,\"** he notes. Contrary to some previous concerns over the risks of excessive protein intake, 2.0 grams per kilogram is not \u201ctoo high\u201d and is not harmful, he adds. Layman agrees. \u201cA lot of people out there will say that eating too much protein is bad for the kidneys or bones, but those are myths,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only evidence that protein can be harmful to the kidneys is in people who already have kidney issues. For healthy individuals, most studies show that intakes [of] up to 3 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight [are] OK. And that's a ridiculously high amount.\u201d\n\nhttp://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/12/11/how-much-protein-do-you-really-need\n\nAlso this, which supports the 1.6 to 2.0g/kg of body weight:\n\nIt is the position of the **International Society of Sports Nutrition** that exercising individuals need approximately **1.4 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day.** The amount is dependent upon the mode and intensity of the exercise, the quality of the protein ingested, and the status of the energy and carbohydrate intake of the individual. Concerns that protein intake within this range is unhealthy are unfounded in healthy, exercising individuals. An attempt should be made to obtain protein requirements from whole foods, but supplemental protein is a safe and convenient method of ingesting high quality dietary protein. The timing of protein intake in the time period encompassing the exercise session has several benefits including improved recovery and greater gains in fat free mass. Protein residues such as branched chain amino acids have been shown to be beneficial for the exercising individual, including increasing the rates of protein synthesis, decreasing the rate of protein degradation, and possibly aiding in recovery from exercise. In summary, exercising individuals need more dietary protein than their sedentary counterparts, which can be obtained from whole foods as well as from high quality supplemental protein sources such as whey and casein protein.\n\nhttp://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-4-8", "id": "d15c3mw"}], [{"comment": "0.8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight is what I've always heard to be ideal.\n\nThis translates to roughly 1.76g/kg bodyweight that you referenced.", "id": "d152m69"}], [{"comment": "It depends entirely on your goals and where you're currently at.

He gives a lot of examples although I have no idea how correct they are. Not advocating anything here, just think it's interesting.\n\n\n>The very first time anyone published a review of the efficacy of undereating as a treatment for obesity\u2014 the psychologist Albert Stunkard and his colleague Mavis McLaren-Hume, in 1959\u2014 this was their conclusion. Nothing much has changed since. Stunkard said their study was motivated by what he called the \u201cparadox\u201d between his own failure to treat obese patients successfully at his New York Hospital clinic by restricting how much they eat and \u201cthe widespread assumption that such treatment was easy and effective.\u201d Stunkard and McLaren-Hume combed the medical literature and managed to find eight articles in which physicians reported on their success rates treating obese and overweight patients in their clinics. The results, said Stunkard, were \u201cremarkably similar and remarkably poor.\u201d Most of these clinics were prescribing diets that allowed only eight hundred or one thousand calories a day\u2014 maybe half what the WHI women said they were eating\u2014 and still only one in four patients ever lost as much as twenty pounds; only one in twenty patients managed to lose as much as forty pounds. Stunkard also reported on his own experience prescribing \u201cbalanced diets\u201d of eight hundred to fifteen hundred calories a day to a hundred obese patients in his own clinic: only twelve lost as much as twenty pounds, and only one lost forty pounds. \u201cTwo years after the end of treatment,\u201d Stunkard wrote, \u201conly two patients had maintained their weight loss.\u201d\n\n\n>The more recent assessments benefit from the use of computers and elaborate statistical analyses, but the results, as Stunkard might say, are still remarkably similar and remarkably poor. Prescribing low-calorie diets for obese and overweight patients, according to a 2007 review from Tufts University, leads, at best, to \u201cmodest weight losses\u201d that are \u201ctransient\u201d\u2014 that is, temporary. Typically, nine or ten pounds are lost in the first six months. After a year, much of what was lost has been regained. The Tufts review was an analysis of all the relevant diet trials in the medical journals since 1980. The single largest such trial ever done yields the very same answer. \u00a7 The researchers were from Harvard and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, which is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is the most influential academic obesity-research institute in the United States. Together they enrolled more than eight hundred overweight and obese subjects and then randomly assigned them to eat one of four diets. These diets were marginally different in nutrient composition (proportions of protein, fat, and carbohydrates), but all were substantially the same in that the subjects were supposed to undereat by 750 calories a day, a significant amount. The subjects were also given \u201cintensive behavioral counseling\u201d to keep them on their diets, the kind of professional assistance that few of us ever get when we try to lose weight. They were even given meal plans every two weeks to help them with the difficult chore of cooking tasty meals that were also sufficiently low in calories. The subjects began the study, on average, fifty pounds overweight. They lost, on average, only nine pounds. And, once again, just as the Tufts review would have predicted, most of the nine pounds came off in the first six months, and most of the participants were gaining weight back after a year. No wonder obesity is so rarely cured. Eating less\u2014 that is, undereating\u2014 simply doesn\u2019t work for more than a few months, if that.\n\n\nWhat's interesting are also the cases of people who were obese but could not afford to overeat like we can today.\n\n>1954: The Pima Again Bureau of Indian Affairs researchers weigh and measure the Pima children and report that more than half, boys and girls both, are obese by age eleven. Living conditions on the Gila River Reservation: \u201cWidespread poverty.\u201d \n\n\n>1959: Charleston, South Carolina Among African Americans, 18 percent of the men and 30 percent of the women are obese. Cash incomes for the heads of families range from $ 9 to $ 53 per week, or the equivalent of about $ 65 to $ 390 per week today. \n\n\n>1960: Durban, South Africa Among Zulu, 40 percent of the adult women are obese. Women in their forties average 175 pounds. The women, on average, are twenty pounds heavier and four inches shorter than the men, but this does not mean they are better fed\u2014 excessive adiposity, the researchers report, is often accompanied by numerous signs of malnutrition. \n\n\n>1961: Nauru, the South Pacific A local physician describes the situation bluntly: \u201cBy European standards, everyone past puberty is grossly overweight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d3t7a06"}, {"comment": "None of that answers the question I asked, though.", "id": "d3t7dqq"}, {"comment": "Oh, I misread that.
