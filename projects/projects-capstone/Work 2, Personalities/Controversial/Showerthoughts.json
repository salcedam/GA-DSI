It's about making sure they know how to take a test and pass said test. Most schools can loose a ton of funding if scores are not high enough. I can pass tests all day longs, doesn't mean I learned anything actually. \n\nEdit: I have done a lot of research on this topic... \n\nIf you look at the numbers, standardized testing has increased at an alarming rate. One of the main reasons is that scores make it easy to show results without accounting for the damage that they may be causing (\u201cHigh Stakes Testing,\u201d 2001, April 25). Peter Henry, in his article \u201cThe Case Against Standardized Testing\u201d (2007), discusses the ever increasing rate of high-stakes testing. In less than ten years, the number and frequency of high stakes tests that have occurred has doubled and redoubled. By the end of 2008 there was an estimated 50 million tests given (Henry, 2007 pp. 39-41). Alfie Kohn simply put it this way: \u201cOur Children are tested to an extent that is unprecedented in our history and unparalleled anywhere else in the world.\u201d (Kohn, 2000b, September 27). Another interesting fact to point out is that we as a country are almost alone in these practices; few other countries test at this magnitude or even use multiple choice tests (Kohn, 2000b, September 27). \n\t Even though standardized testing has been around for quite a few years, the last few decades have seen the amount of emphasis put on tests increase greatly (Neill, 2009 pp.28-29).  There are numerous reasons why such emphasis is placed on tests more and more. This can be because such things as political pressure, the demand for accountability, or just the thought that more tests means better learning. One of the biggest reasons is the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) by former President George. W. Bush in 2002. Under NCLB schools are required to have proficient test scores on a state-wide basis. Students must also achieve \u201cAdequate Yearly Progress\u201d (Neill, 2009 pp. 28-29).  If schools or students fail to meet this requirement the consequences can be dire. A school may lose funding or be restructured. A student, on the other hand, may be held back a year or, even worse, not be able to graduate (Neill, 2009 pp.28-29). This is also one of the major contributing factors for a test to become what is considered a high stakes test.\n\tWith the increase of testing and greater emphasis being placed on them it causes more bad than good. High stakes testing can be linked to sickness and illness in students (\u201cHigh Stakes Testing,\u201d 2001, April 25). Children are getting sick, and research suggests a lot of it can be blamed on the large amount of stress and anxiety high stakes testing can cause. This claim is backed  by many doctors, parents and teachers. In \u201cHigh Stakes Testing\u201d (2001, April 25) Kathy Vannini, a school nurse in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, states that she dislikes the time of year tests are given. \n     \u201cMy office is filled with children with headaches and stomachaches every day,\" she reports. \"One third-grader was beside himself on the morning of the test\u2014he could not stop sobbing. I've been a school nurse for twenty years, and the stresses on children have worsened in that time. But this testing has greatly increased their anxiety level.\" (\u201cHigh Stakes Testing,\u201d 2001, April 25)\nTest-related anxiety problems can also lead to even worse problems: sleep issues, drug use, attendance problems, and much more, can be linked back to the use and increasing amount of high stakes testing (\u201cHigh Stakes Testing,\u201d 2001, April 25).  \n", "id": "d51lmcj"}, {"comment": "That sounds like shitty test design to me.

I just recently cracked down on what I feed my kids for the last 3 months of this school year, the transformation in their performance at school was drastic and they are not putting weight on the same way as they did before.

It's just really sad what teaching has turned into. It's all about test scores and pass rates because schools and teachers get bonuses if they do well, but get funding cut if they don't. There was one scandal where teachers intentionally let students do poorly one year, then basically taught the test the next year to get a bigger bonus that was based off score improvements.\n\nRegarding pass rates, I don't feel as if any of the students were given the education they deserved. Advanced courses were dumbed down, essentially letting more kids into them. It really wasn't advanced at all - it just looked better on paper that so many students went through and passed it.\n\nI felt really bad for some of the kids with mental illnesses and behavioral problems. Some teachers just pushed them on through without actually caring whether or not they actually learned. Being able to say \"Hey! Look at all of these troubled and mentally challenged kids that successfully went though our program!\" is given so much more precedence than legitimate learning.\n\nGranted, there are some teachers where I worked that were exceptions to the rule and actually cared, a lot, and did a good job. There were just a lot more that were apathetic and went along with the system to get a paycheck.\n\nSchedule-wise, it was ridiculous what some people were pushing for. One teacher was spearheading a campaign to cut winter break down to 1 week (I mean, it's really almost there anyways). If I remember correctly, her reasoning was because there are a lot of low income students in the district that eat the free breakfast at the school, meaning the parents apparently weren't going to feed them over break leading to health problems.

Romans 3:12-14\n3) based on this rebellion, all people must face God's judgment and the  punishment for rebellion is death. Hebrews 9:27\n4) because God loves his creation, god sent his son Jesus who always lived under his rule to take our judgment and die in our place. 1 Peter 3:18\n5) Jesus conquered death, gives new life, and will return again to judge. 1 peter 1:3\n6) therefore, there are two ways to live: 1) to reject god as our ruler and face death, or 2) to submit to Jesus as our ruler and rely on his sacrifice to gain forgiveness.

Reddit formatting, everybody.", "id": "d58bwe8"}, {"comment": "Here's how it works :\n\nReddit uses Markdown for its formatting. If you want to write something in **bold** for example, you can put a double asterisk (\\*\\*) between what you want to bold. If you want to write the special characters that are used in Markdown and not use their effect, you have to use the escaping character before the special character, in this case a backslash (\\\\) which will erase the escape character and display the special character instead.\n\nExample : writing \"\\*\\*bold\\*\\*\" will display as \"**bold**\" but writing \"\\\\\\*\\\\\\*bold\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\" will display as \"\\*\\*bold\\*\\*\"\n\nThe problem with the shrug emote comes from the fact that the underscore (\\_) is used as a special character for italics. Result :\n\n- Typing \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af will display as \u00af\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af because the backslash is used to escape the first underscore and thus disappears. The other underscore is displayed normally because there is no other underscore to link it with anyway.\n\n- Typing \u00af\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af will display as \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af because while the first backslash escapes the second backslash, allowing it to be displayed, the first underscore isn't escaped anymore and thus is linked with the other underscore, making both disappear and putting \"(\u30c4)\" in italics.\n- Typing \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af will display as \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af because the first backslash escapes the second (thus disappearing and letting the second one display as normal) and the third one escapes the first underscore (and thus disappears), leading to the shrug emote display as normal. _However_ if you were to use another underscore in the same paragraph, it would screw up formatting as the second underscore in the emote would be linked with the one that appeared after, making everything in-between italics and also making the underscore disappear. Exemple : This is the emote : \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. This is a sentence which will be ended by an underscore_. This is another sentence. If you want to avoid that, escape the second underscore in the emote by writing it this way : \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af (which will display as normal like this : \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af)\n\n\n**TL;DR** : You should write the shrug emote this way : \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af\n\nA lot of backslash sorcery was involved when writing this, which you can witness if you have RES and click source.", "id": "d58db61"}, {"comment": "Try adding three. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "id": "d58c0v8"}, {"comment": "Just nothing but backslashes.", "id": "d58c56c"}, {"comment": "\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ should be like an RES trick to automatically post \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "id": "d58cwhn"}, {"comment": "[relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1638/)", "id": "d58dga1"}, {"comment": "> What could go wrong? \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nConsidering now many bad decisions Nintendo (who subsequently pretty much owns The Pokemon Company) has made in the recent few years, it is entirely possible for that to be their reaction.", "id": "d58bsnc"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d58bvb7"}, {"comment": "Modern Warfare and World at War on WII are still my favorite fps.

He contested politics is a great viewing point for how people don't tend to think critically, or get stuck into echo chambered ideas. \n\nHis suggestion (among many other criticisms, etc.) was that students in secondary education (here in the UK.) should have Plato's Republic and a number of other ''easier'' philosophy suggestions as compulsory reading. I had a disagreement with him on some philosophy of education concepts but I do agree that its *amazingly worthwhile to read* for a number of reasons.\n\nThe key reason though is that you'll read it, and *hopefully* disagree with enough of it to make you critical of the concepts, Philosophy is a great tool for getting people used to disagreement and discussion to solve an idea; as opposed to taking that idea as you're presented it and using it as a factual basis. Looking at Plato's concepts that suggest Eugenics, or his ''Philosopher Kings'' concept etc, is all worthwhile and very relevant to todays politics.\n\nThere's a load of other random texts that he and I would suggest for such things but I won't ramble on, if anyone does by any random chance feel curious, send me a pm or something :) \n\nEdit: For those in the sciences: this applies there aswell, and there's some both fascinating and beautiful writing on the Philosophy of science and how the logic of scientific endeavors  functions. Same for mathematics etc, most studies!  I feel like a bit of a broken record: but read philosophy people, *please*, you won't regret it. \n\nEdit x2: **I've gotten a lot of asks over PM so I figured i'd put a few key bits up here,** my post I pasted to people was horribly rambley and included why's for each and every text; but here's a few key suggestions for dipping your toes into various points, I'd value any input from those more read than myself if they have some better suggestions! \n\n \n**Plato; The Republic**\nAs I talked about above.\n\n**Descartes; meditations on First Philosophy**\nDescartes is where you'll find the ''I think, there for I am'' concept, looking at concept of self, aswell as various other branches of philosophy. It can be slightly harder to read than a few of the others here, due to its period and various forces influencing it, but its key reading.\n\n**Camus; The Outsider**\nFrench individuals may already be more familiar with this; it's a fascinating novel, typically associated more with the coming of age concepts, and is especially good if you're more into fiction, Camus was particularly gifted in both philosophical concepts and fictional writing, if you want to try some of his work without as much of the fiction, try Myth of Sisyphus! \n\n**Nietzsche; Thus Spoke Zarathustra**\nThis one is a tad less inviting to those outside of philosophy, or who are less used to it. I would still highly reccomend it, it's told in a beautiful biblical style, detailing a hermit essentially returning to the world to spread wisdom in some sense. ''God is dead, and we have killed him.'' comes from this. I won't ramble more, but yeah.\n\n**Lao Tzu; Dao De Jing** \nEastern philosophy is different to western stuff, in both its core assumptions in some ways, and in its style of presentation. It's often more poetic, less hard and analytical. This is the sort of book you get an annotated copy of, and read a poem a day with it's explanations. Some really won't appreciate eastern works; and I can appreciate the differences, but I find it fantastic either way.\n\n**Sun Tzu; Art of War** \nWhy not hit the East with a double. I don't think this needs introduction; it's one of those texts that's worth reading if you want to understand how those with power may think due to it's prevelance in reading lists of political and business leaders. \n\n**Machiavelli; The Prince.** \nThis is essentially ''The Art of War'' for statecraft, and is wonderfully thought provoking. He explores many, many smaller ideas within the book, writing small essays on each that vary from a page to 10, which means it's nice for pick up and drop reading. You'll find ideas such as asking what makes a good 'prince', or poltician. What is required for a good leader? How should he treat his people? what values are important? ... How one should best utilize Mercenaries..? Ok some of it won't be *quite* as directly useful, but it's the way he thinks that's important! I like his parts on how one conquers and maintains power of a land, in that he suggests a number of small ways that make maintaining power far easier; Living on the land you conquer yourself. \n\nAs for a few more names: Ayn Rand is worth reading, Even if you disagree with her aggressively, she does raise various questions that I think are worth answering in order to better understand your own philosophies. Marx, Lenin and Trotsky all wrote worthwhile pieces to read, Lenin's critiques of Imperialism and Western capitalism is fasciating, even if you don't agree - I am by no means a communist as it were - I think it's good as a foundational understanding of the clash between the left and right ideologies you see in various western countries. Foucault  is fascinating for his views on history, why and how we should use history, and what the purpose of the study is, heavily inspired by Nietzsche who wrote on the same topic. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQOfbObFOCw\n\nThese videos are also *amazing*, for younger audiences or those with quite frankly less time to sink putting into reading source texts, these videos on each philosopher do a (mostly) good job at summarizing their views, why they had them, and why it's *important* to consider their world view. \n\nI hope these help, sorry for any mistakes, it's late and i've had a few!

If you really think about it, the majority of people aren't in school.

Is logical, because you still posess the human bias of viewing yourself as correct, and feeling as though you are right, before you've even done your own homework or your own thinking.\n\nIt's stupid to think this doesn't apply to yourself, Socrates even said \"I am a genius, because I understand why you do the things you do perfectly. When you don't\" Abbreviated of course. He also said \"And I went to a wise man, to see if he was correct, but all I saw was a man who taught what he thought was correct, and never actually corrected himself because his ego dictated he was right.\"\n\nIt's pretty deep when you think about it, I mean most people who are in their 40's and 30's understand why philosophy is so important and education, and yet because you children are allowed an internet connection you assume because some person with percieved authority says something, it must be right. And then even after you get out of that faze, you trust nothing but the ideas your own ego dictates.\n\nRegardless that the people who had you are most likely the most educated people you will ever meet. You still cling to your ego's.\n\nIf we gave kids education, and didn't teach them humbleness, and fairness, not how to be logical. But how to be not biased, and how to respect others, and be fair to every situation, person, and idea. We will never get anyone who will argue against the popular belief, because they will only use logic to justify their own egos.\n\nSo in a sense, regardless if you know logic (most people do) the main issue isn't education of logic (Still education nonetheless) it's respect of logic, we need to teach kids to be fair, nice, and most of all respectful.\n\nAnd you can't do that when you give them the means of being the opposite.\n\nSo we first have to teach them to be respectful, then teach them to be logical.\n\nAnd that is why I actually consider countries with lower educations and higher sociability to be a lot more smart. Because regardless that they lack academia and have higher birth rates and less entertainment ect ect. They grow up to be respectful and fair, and sociable. So that when they learn academia, they are fair towards academia, because they grew up with a humble respectful mentality.\n\nSo in a sense, although they are not as smart, and as educated, they are more likely to be right about something because they are humble enough to take the time to figure out what the actual answer is.\n\nInstead of egotistically proposing a simplistic answer or idea that could work on paper like \"Teach logic\" Which has been something imposed a lot, but to no avail, and most disregard that most logical people were never actually taught logic, and actually Mensa is the most common practitioners of alternative ideas, I mean most people in Mensa have extremely varying beliefs.\n\nBut not a general consensus, at least in the 1980's and 70's. \n\nNow it's mostly atheist, even though you could argue, god, or no god the earth pretty much exists and no ones denying that.

What about Tamir Rice, we know he had a toy gun and maybe that alarmed some people, but that cop rolled up, immediately opened his door and shot this kid within seconds, didn't even give the kid a chance to respond. And then they didn't officer any medical aid while he laid there dying. How is it possible that this didn't even lead to an indictment.

We are all human beings, yet for some reason cops never can make mistakes, can never have biases, can never make rash decisions that cost others lives? We saw just this week that some Memphis cops joked around on snapchat about shooting black people. Or about about the off duty NYPD officer who killed a black man in a road rage incident, made up a story about how he pummelled him, yet once we see a video, its clear that he was shot just as he was approaching the officer's car. He hadn't laid a finger on him. Do that laws don't apply to police. Did you know that citizens have the right to resist an unlawful arrest? If an officer cannot provide a valid warrant, probable cause, or state the reason for the arrrest, then a citizen has legal right to physically resist the same way as if they were being assaulted. Did you know that the cops who killed Sterling, illegally took the surveillance tapes without a warrant or the store owner's permission? Did you know that there are reports that Sterling was possibly the wrong person or that the complaint that was called in had no merit? The cops approached him based on a vague description, got aggressive with him, yelled at him, escalated the situation, did not provide a reason for him being detained, tased him, and tackled him. To me that sounds like an unlawful arrest. The only way to determine if he had been guilty of anything would be to look at the survillance tapes, which the cops took illegally. \n\nListen the problem here is police escalate far too many situations, they resort to using their weapons far too easily, they seem to use way too much force and violence for situations that don't need them, and then when they do go clearly too far, they are not held to the same standards the rest of the us citizens are held to. They are almost never charged, or indicted, they just get a paid vacation until things cool down. You are allowed to support good police officers, as I do, and still denounce this behavior and these practices. You can still support police and watch some of these videos and say \"they handled that wrong, and now someone is dead\", that is possible. You don't have to be pro cop, anti black, or pro black, anti cop. We should all be pro-good cop, pro black (in the sense that their punishment and force fits their crimes, if a crime was committed at all). What I am saying shouldn't be some controversial idea, its how things should operate. Why is it that you need some unattainable about of proof that a cop acted incorrectly, but you don't give that same burden of proof to the victims? You have no problem assuming the victims deserved it or did somethign wrong, yet its impossible that the police did too?", "id": "d57u7uh"}, {"comment": "OK not everyone who commits suicide has a mental illness. Besides the facts that she said she had tried before and she said she had been depressed before but wasn't now. It's not like most people who are depressed tell others. \n\nBefore Eric Garner most people, including me, believed that \"if you could speak you could breath\". It's a phrase that was well known and no one decided to correct it until after Eric Garner died. So the officers did believe he could breathe. It's not like suspects haven't lied before right.\n\nTamir Rice. WE know it was a toy gun. The police didn't. I don't know why you guys keep intentionally forgetting about that. It just completely invalidates your case when you intentionally leave stuff like that out. \"maybe\" it alarmed some people. Because someone calling 911 about it isn't alarmed.  Last watching the video shows Rice walking towards the car and reaching for his toy. That is a response to me. \n\nFreddie Gray. There were reports of other injuries during transport and they were implementing a policy to fix that. \n\nWell resisting an unlawful arrest is only legal in some places. There is a reason people are told not to do it even if it is legal though. If an officer is trying to arrest you and you try to resist they are trained to overcome that. It's just a stupid thing to resist an arrest. The cop has the gun. He has more force to arrest you than you have force to resist him. \n\nAlton Sterling is a prime example of this. To him he didn't have a reason to be arrested. However the police had gotten a call saying he had threatened someone with his gun. It was a lawful arrest however to Sterling it wasn't and he resisted. Do you see know why it is completely idiotic to resist arrest? How was it a vague description? \"selling CDs on the corner\" There was only one fucking guy selling CDs. \nReally Small was killed walking to the car. When I watched the video he looked like he was leaning into the car. \n\nThe reason why I play devils advocate is because you guys are doing the exact opposite. You guys have condemned many cops without any evidence either way. The reason in need \"unattainable\" proof is because you need no proof. \n\nI'm pretty sure police violence will escalate because of BLM. The group puts cops into dangerous situation more often than normal which will cause more cops to shoot quicker. \n\nThe controversial part isn't that there are bad cops.

If one runner was on base, then two runs.  There are three bases plus the batter.  So if the bases are loaded, the maximum amount of runs would be four.  So a home run would be 1-4 runs, depending on the number of bases occupied, home plate always is occupied by the batter.\n\nIF I could share a video, here is a highlight from my hometown Milwaukee Brewers from 1987.

The Brewers actually hit two homeruns that inning to win.  \n\nThe announcer in that highlight is [Bob Uecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Uecker), you might be familiar with him from the movie Major League.  His character was Harry Doyle and [here](http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25246089/top-10-harry-doyle-lines-in-honor-of-major-league-night-in-Milwaukee) are some of that characters best quotes from the movie, which was partially filmed in Milwaukee.  All or most of the game footage was filmed in Milwaukee.  He has been in Milwaukee since the beginning and he is one of the best announcers in all of baseball history.  We are blessed to have him in such small market.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ8YbAWtl5g) is another one of my favorite calls by Bob Uecker.  I was also at this game.  This was great season for Brewers fans.\n\nThank you for asking and allowing me to share some of my love for baseball.

I didn't know what a deductible was until I googled it, because I was buying my first car and needed insurance.  Buying the car itself was a whole other headache I wish I had been walked through during school.  And like another poster said, taxes would have been nice to know how to do.  My parents did help me with them, as they should, but I feel I still do not have a complete understanding of what I'm doing when it comes to my own finances.\n\nIf your parents taught you how to do all these things by the time you were out of high school, congratulations.

Not the ones who provide for and support (in both a material and emotional sense) their kids, if they didn't teach their kids to expect any and every possible thing that they might encounter? Or the ones who tried their hardest with what they had to make sure their child was safe, healthy, and happy? Ok then. That seems like a reasonable standard that suits all family structures and circumstances. Sure.  \n\nOn another note, most life skills needed just to get by are not particularly difficult. If you don't know how to read a recipe, even if its the back of a Hamburger Helper box, or you can't follow simple instructions on forms, or even handle basic problems, then I don't think anyone can help you. Not even your parents. If you know how to do a 30-second Google search, then you know how to do all of these things. \n\nTaxes, insurance, and finance can get extremely complicated, so I'll grant you that one. However, few adults fully understand these things (including most middle-aged or elderly people), despite insisting that they do. They only understand the parts relevant to themselves. \n\nNot to mention, plenty of things you can pay to have done for a reasonable price, or even dirt cheap if you do a little digging (no pun intended). I don't need to know how to tailor a suit or change a car part if I can afford to pay a reasonable fee for someone else to do it for me. \n\nAdditionally, we don't all live the exact same lives as our parents. I've already done things in my short life that my dad couldn't even fathom, much less prepare me for. You cannot prepare for any and everything. No one, regardless of their upbringing, can know exactly what to expect from the rest of their life the very minute they turn 18. You can prepare yourself all you want, but something will take you by surprise and you will be woefully unprepared for it. The real world goes from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye.

I never implied that one can be raised to expect any and every possible outcome. All I said can be fully understood if you just read it as it says on the comment. You don't need to extrapolate my statements or take them outta context just because it makes you feel bad about your parents. But just to break it up for you, what I meant was that good parents instill in their children the interest in detecting things they might wanna learn *before* they need it. Life (at least in a pragmatic level, obviously) isn't pure randomness, most of the **practical** problems we come across as we grow up can be learned in general terms before they show up. I can't be more clear than that, it's up to your intellectual honesty now.\n\n>No one, regardless of their upbringing, can know exactly what to expect from the rest of their life the very minute they turn 18.\n\nAnother straw-man. Or you just didn't understand at all what the thread was about. It's about learning **practical life skills**, not anything abstractly emotional and personal.

It absolutely doesn't. The concept of racial privilege is, in fact, dependent upon the *depersonalization* of the individuals being viewed through that lens, meaning that these racial groups end up being coarse enough (from a data standpoint) to still encompass an absolutely HUGE number of people. The fact is, if a white person insists on measuring themselves against other people in terms of financial success, the most accurate measuring stick will be other white people, simply because there are objective and statistically measurable differences between the experiences of white and black Americans in that area. So, as far as personal achievement goes, I don't think there's as much devaluation going on as much as appropriate categorization.\n\nBut again, the problem is *not about the individual*, and the people upset about the reality of white privilege generally aren't pointing the finger at the white individuals benefitting - rather, they're pointing out that we have to use these different measuring sticks because they have to work proportionately harder to achieve the same amount of financial success as their white counterparts. \n\nAnd look, we're talking about race here, but the fact is you could apply this to tons of things, from gender to attractiveness, and find that there are biases that exist for all of these. A lot of people look at that and say, \"See, isolating race as one of these bias points is arbitrary, and it's not going to suddenly put everyone on equal footing if we erased it tomorrow.\" The issue is that we don't have a recognized (let alone legal) history of segregating our citizens' rights based on good looks, but we *do* have that history when it comes to race - it's not arbitrary, it's a recognition that past is prologue. It's also a recognition that the *great majority* of factors that we use to measure quality of life tend to tip heavily in the favor of white people when we break up the data based on race.

How is that any different from saying, \"blacks are violent criminals even though some will never commit violence or crimes\"?\n\nIt seems to me that people experiencing privilege are of higher socio-economic status, regardless of race. It just feels hypocritical to use the phrase \"white privilege\" while either admitting that some whites will never benefit from this alleged privilege or doing the contrary and saying that all whites benefit from it. It seems like we're grouping people together based on their race, which was the start of all this inequality in the first place.", "id": "d2lat8y"}, {"comment": "Well, first off, white privilege IS experienced by all white people, just to varying degrees based on other factors, of which socioeconomic status is certainly one. The issue is that certain situations present the problem in starker relief than others, and there are some situations in which it is not really the most dramatic factor. I personally think that access to college education is primarily a socioeconomic issue, and that addressing race would represent a secondary or tertiary component in solving that particular overall problem. But other issues, notably relations with police in this country, white privilege exists for all white people. Again, it's not to say that all police are racist or that all white people are getting away with murder, but just to acknowledge that such strong disparities in the number and intensity of interactions with police clearly indicate a larger problem for black Americans much more than for white Americans.\n\nThe best metaphor I can think of is loaded dice. You're still going to lose sometimes - otherwise they're too strongly weighted and everyone will figure out what's going on - but the key is to shift the odds enough to affect your bottom line. If the average guy rolls 4/10 winners, but you manage to roll 6/10, or even just 5/10, you are going to do better than the other guy. White people as individuals don't load their own dice, here, society just kinda builds it in, and the numbers bear it out.\n\nSo do a lot of personal experiences. [Henry Louis Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates_arrest_controversy) would argue that the racial component is very present in his life, in spite of being substantially richer and better connected than you or I (one would assume, we *are* having an involved discussion on Reddit).\n\nGrouping people together by race is honestly OK by me - we do it subconsciously and probably should, I'd want to know the race of the guy I'm picking out of a police lineup, the same way I'd want to know hair color, height, build, etc...The difference between race and these characteristics, though, is that we place cultural value on race, but not any of the other stuff. There's nobody saying, \"I hate all those lazy redheads!\" or \"fucking tallies, taking all our apple-picking jobs!\". Once we can be realistic enough about our ape-brain's instincts on categorization to strip the value judgments from race the same way we have from height and hair color, maybe we can do away with race as a grouping mechanism. Until then, though, it dictates far too much about the experience of the people of different races, and needs to be acknowledged.\n\nFinally, grouping people together based on race was not the start of inequality - inequality has existed since the first human figured out that they wanted something and took it from someone else. White privilege is an upshot of the slavery that started 500+ years ago, but Brazil had more slaves than we do and both a substantially more racially integrated and substantially less economically stratified society. It's a modern American problem, born of the way that we've handled things since then - which has involved a LOT of grouping people together by race. If you want to adopt the attitude of just starting from scratch and looking beyond race, you're basically telling a lot of people who have been eating a lot of shit for long time, \"Well, I'll stop doing that. Moving on, then...\" but not actually acknowledging any wrongdoing or doing anything to actually help remedy the situation.", "id": "d2lz24k"}, {"comment": "Obviously racism and inequality exist and have existed for a long time.

It's just one more thing used to divide us by race. I think it's subjective, and I think it's racist. I think that using the term to try and further race relations is like fucking for virginity or fighting for peace, it will only serve to impede progress that would otherwise be made through different means.

Only when the front brain gets involved do we start to parse these things apart. \n\nBut still, you're looking at this whole thing the wrong way - life and success are not wrestling, with two opponents and a zero-sum, winner-takes-all game.

A little empathy goes a long way, man.\n\nSubjective is defined as \"based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions.\" Statistics about the influence of race on interactions with police are not feelings.

That's completely inaccurate, in fact, the white privilege theory is what creates a zero sum game. By suggesting that X loses A (is discriminated against) so Y must receive A (receives some sort of privilege), this is where we see the zero sum effect.\n\nYou are trying to use statistics to create an argument for white privilege. The problem with this is that you can't just take a statistic which shows that blacks rank poorly in this category or that category and compare it to whites who rank high in these categories and say that it automatically derives from a privileged state for the whites. That's not how it works. True, blacks may be negatively affected by certain systems in place but this does not elevate their white counterparts to a place of privilege, which leads me to my next point...\n\nUsing the word \"privilege\" suggests that all whites are automatically in an elevated position. What this fails to take into consideration is the fact that for privilege to exist there must be a baseline to compare it to. If blacks are the victims and whites are the privileged class then who is the baseline group? That is the fundamental logical fallacy with the whole white privilege theory. Your experiment fails without a control group. The white privilege theory has no control group, just the two supposed outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, you fail to recognize that \"subjective\" has more than one definition. It just so happens that both of the most commonly used definitions for the word subjective can be applied to white privilege. You insist on saying that white privilege isn't subjective, that it's objective. Based on what? Some statistics? Once again, you can't just take numbers that show a disparity between races and come to the conclusion that the race with better rankings is automatically privileged. You would need to show the causation for this disparity. Then you would have to prove that the causation is that the white race is privileged, which can only be proven through subjective observances. For white privilege to be objective you would have to assume that there are no other factors that could impede this privileged state, such as socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic makeup of one's geographic location, etc... Since we know these other factors exist and we know that these factors will play a role in whether a white person receives any sort of preferential treatment, the only conclusion that we can logically come to is that white privilege is not objective. Coming to this conclusion, it is clear that the term white privilege is in and of itself a racist term.", "id": "d2m78zw"}, {"comment": "You literally just argued yourself into a position where white privilege exists and has impact - as much as all of those other factors you mentioned in your last paragraph. There are all kinds of privilege, and to fail to acknowledge the existence of one of them just because it happens to single out a group you're apparently a part of is myopic. \n\nYou *do* understand that black people get arrested much more than white people, right? And that black babies die at a higher rate than white babies? Yes, I am using statistics and data to justify argument, and yes, I am applying causality to a systemic issue here. What other options are there? To assert that skin color is somehow indicative of parental fitness? Why else would more black infants die than white ones? \n\nI guess the biggest thing to me is why this concept bothers you so much. It literally amounts to some people saying that they didn't get a fair shake at things - they're not saying that *you* did it, they're not blaming you. They're just asserting that they're getting harassed by police, having fewer job opportunities, and having negative social constructs associated with their race - things that the average white person can't say they've been subjected to. Just because something is outside your experience doesn't make it not true. Also, this is where the privilege lies - *relative to black Americans, white Americans are arrested less*. There doesn't need to be a baseline in order to establish privilege, merely disparate treatment based on irrelevant criteria in similar circumstances. \n\nYou say that both definitions of subjective can be applied to white privilege. The first definition is the one I cited - \"based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions.\" Again, there is statistical evidence to show that black people are treated differently by authority figures and earn less money than similarly educated white people. I'm pointedly NOT establishing causality here, merely pointing out that, when controlling for other factors, black people have a harder time than white people. This is not about personal feelings, tastes, or opinions, it's about numbers. The second definition is grammatical, and is \"of, relating to, or denoting a case of nouns and pronouns used for the subject of a sentence.\" If you can connect that with the concept of white privilege, I will send you some Reddit gold.\n\nI think that you're seeing causality here where there is none, and reacting defensively. Nobody is pointing at you and saying you did anything wrong, but cops are arresting black people more than white people.

We can not fix this problem by refusing to acknowledge that economics are the driving force between this disparity. We can only fix this problem when we recognize that the systems in place reward the rich and disproportionately punish the poor.\n\nTake the criminal justice system.

OJ Simpson is a perfect example, in spite of any racial profiling that might have taken place he was found innocent. If OJ was poor he would have been convicted.

Poverty and crime are not just statistically related, there is a causal relationship between them.\n\nThere are so many examples of how a poor person is discriminated against, even if not intentionally. For example, if a panhandler approaches you begging for money it doesn't matter what race he is you have some bias about beggars. If a clerk sees that person in their store they will watch him more closely than someone who is nicely dressed. \n\nCops pull over older model cars more often than new cars. It is easy to mistake this type of profiling as racial bias, and in effect it does impact black people disproportionately to white people. However the root cause of this is not racism, but the relationship between poverty and crime. I certainly will not deny there are racist cops, I can guarantee it in fact. There are racist latino cops, racist black cops, racist white cops, racist middle eastern cops and racist asian cops. All of them though will target poor people first.\n\nWhen it comes to things like employment and education it is great that we have legislated anti-discrimination policies but it will take generations upon generations of families to begin to fix the issue. While it is good to address the specific wrongs and discrimination that takes place, a racial profile to explain the vast and complicated nature of the oppression affecting so many black people is not.

Do you not care about the other 14,000 or so people murdered?\n\nTo put in perspective how ridiculous your post is:\n\n I imagine that per capita more people are killed and seriously injured in European countries by food utensils than Americans are killed and seriously injured by guns in the tiny minority of homicides in mass shootings that the American media focuses on. Particularly in certain demographics in certain areas of European countries.\n\nNo demogrpahic in any area of U.S.A has anywhere near the same level of violence *with ALL weapons* than some demogrpahics in areas of European countries *have with food utensils.* Look at the number of men aged 13-30 who were stabbed with food utensils in some areas of England in the 00s and the number of aged 12-30 men living in those areas and if you do the same with America but put every kind of serious violence together America and all its guns can't come near to the 'permanent and devastating harm' wrought by food utensils in England in the late 90s and 00s.\n\nIn some areas with a population of less than 100,000 adolescent men there was something like on average a stabbing every 10-20 minutes. Do the maths, in some poor areas most boys were getting stabbed atleast once every few years and that is how it was. The peaceful land of U.S.A doesn't have violence like that. Largely because U.S.A has guns so people don't fk about because it will end in someone getting shot and probably dying.\n\nAfter pointing out how that mindless Americans use a tiny minority of shootings as the main focus of the problem with guns, suicides is the other thing I like to point out along with shootings of boyfriends and girlfriends etc.\n\nWhether there is strong gun control or not is mainly discussing suicides and domestic shootings as those are the people who may not own guns otherwise and may not have shot their boyfriend or girlfriend or shot themselves if they had not had easy access to a gun. The rest of the tens of thousands of shootings with guns will still happen and not be effected.\n\nProblem is, those rural people who currently have the highest rate of gun owndership and have the lowest rates of homicide... will still be able to own guns if they like. Just like how in European countries with strong gun control people can still own guns.\n\nThe problem with most shootings in America that are street violence is gang culture etc. The problem with the rest of shootings in America is gun owning culture.\n\nIntroducing strong gun control doesn't really effect either. Better community policing effects the street violence problems.\n\nYou preach about understanding the other side's point of view but you haven't done it at all. Instead you have mostly just spewed out inane nonsense about something like 0.1% of American shootings being the main problem when those perpatrators could easily get guns no matter what the U.S goverment tried to change.\n\nGun control in U.S.A really is jut effectively nothing but a suicide discussion. It won't make a differnece to mass shootings, it won't make a difference to domestic shootings, it won't make a difference to street violence shootings - It's just mainly a suicide discussion.\n\niirc the majority of criminal shootings in U.S.A are with illegally owned guns and U.S.A is a country flooded with millions of guns. U.S.A cannot do anything with gun control laws. Just like in England gun homicides increased after the bans on automatic weapons and handguns came in, and that's merry old England and not U.S.A that is already flooded with millions of guns and enormous muder rates in some urban areas. If Americans actually care about all the tens of thousands of young men being shot in America then start talking about actually helping these areas and be serious about solving the problems of street violence.\n\nBut of course it will never happen. Because Americans don't actually care about anything that the media doesn't tel them to care about.\n\nAnd don't bring up some pathetic \"but those 100-200 people who die a year in media focused shootings are still a big problem that we have to do anything to stop\" - don't even try it.\n\nBesides that those people can still easily get a gun even if there are strong gun control laws (heck alot of these guys are capable of making bombs, they could even BUILD homemade automatic pipe guns), *tens of thousands* of Americans die *each _in traffic accidents_*.\n\nIf Americans think gun control to remove unneccessary gun ownership in order to prevent afew hundred deaths is a big deal, then _they must be spend ten times as much time arguing for car control to remove unneccessary driving in order to prevent the *tens of thousands* of deaths on the road_.\n\nThere isn't different sides that need to be listened to. On one side there is looking at the facts and statistics of violent crime with different weapon types in different urban and rural areas in different nations and looking at those nation's gun control laws, punishment for illegal owned types of weapons, how the nature of the crime relates to the relationship of the victim and perpetrator etc and having intellignet, effective community policing and aggressive tactics against gangs and violent culture and on the other side there are just morons and Americans galvanized by media nonsense about guns being evil who have no understanding of violence and gun violence and gun laws in other nations and how there are no correlations.", "id": "czku809"}, {"comment": "[This](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160202090811.htm).", "id": "czlesp3"}, {"comment": "not an argument. doesn't counter anything i've said.", "id": "d098gl1"}, {"comment": "Didn't read anything you said, so that checks out.", "id": "d09dtrc"}, {"comment": "What's to oversimplify?

In those cultures, young people already have lots of agency and autonomy, and instead of open rebellion you see variations and personal twists on traditional crafts and hunting methods and etc.\n\nInuit peoples in Alaska and Canada have seen a sharp rise in \"juvenile delinquency\" as contemporary western culture seeps in, especially in television and its depiction of the social structure and norms regarding people in that age group.\n\nThe disintegration of older concepts of youth is also often accompanied by a disintegration of older concepts of manhood in those cultures.

The term \"before\" implies [linear] time, and time does not exist when the whole universe is effectively a point mass, so that's a totally fallacious argument.

It would be quite impossible for us to measure physical laws that *didn't* exist in such a way that we could measure them. It'd be a little hard to measure quantities when said quantities determine your existence is impossible, wouldn't it? That is, in **any** realm where we exist to measure stuff, then the traits of said realm must accommodate our existence. The fine-tuned universe argument is something similar to what was claimed before the Theory of Evolution (i.e. - \"It's complicated and *seems* like it was designed specifically for us, so it must have been!\") Furthermore, the idea that something has to have \"purpose\" assumes either causality\u2014which is precisely what science deals with\u2014or it assumes a higher-order intent. Saying \"This doesn't have purpose!\" when the purpose you're looking for is higher-order intent is, again, fallacious.

It's plausible that a non-human brain would find something we generally find \"noisy\" to be musical. Since our brains are very similarly wired, we can map out common traits that sound has to have for a human brain to consider it music, but, ultimately, it's a brain-thing (that can be scientifically analyzed).\n\nI'm not really sure how to interpret your \"random collection of ink and paper\" comment.

A simulation denotes a program like the SIMS in which we exist. How strange to think about, for someone who enjoys playing open world games occasionally this makes some sense. \n\nOur particular universe was given a set of parameters and laws that can be studied and understood, until a point, when the math and physics break down.

Yet another example is lizards of the genus Teiidae, which can copulate with both male and female mates.\n\nFor sake of representing both sides, this is from the psychotic shit-hole that I'm upset I stumbled on, conservapedia: The homosexuality in animals myth refers to the current interest on whether homosexual behavior is or is not zoologically \"natural.\" This is largely a sterile debate because behavior is not necessarily moral even if \"natural;\" because the nature of human beings is not necessarily the same as the nature of other species, and because it is not at all clear when an observed behavior can be counted as \"sexual,\" or as implying a sexual \"orientation.\" Examples such as one male mounting another have been used as evidence in the argument that homosexuality is natural and therefore should be permitted in human beings.

Eccentric and socially awkward comedic geniuses like Andy Kaufman and Mitch Hedberg come to mind. \n\nI think general intelligence is required or at the least is extremely important. You have to be somewhat generally intelligent to pick up on references, make connections, make puns, play on words ect. \n\nMy best friend Clint is the funniest human being I know. He doesn't even try to be funny, he just is. His vocabulary and abilities with words is astonishing. He was put into the gifted program in middle school, was a mostly straight A student, so he has significant general intelligence. \n\nHe was always considered very funny very strange by everyone who knew him and he was well liked. He wrote original jokes, funny poems, and limericks. He won second place at the university poetry slam. He had the whole damn place rolling laughing. He is just a power house at making people laugh. We roomed together often during college and his room was a mess of notebooks everywhere with his writing, poetry, jokes, and stories. He had no intention of publishing or even sharing the stuff with anybody. He just did it out of compulsion.  \n\nBut socially, he is a buffoon. He has no social skills whatsoever, and if he is talking to people who don't know and understand him there is a good chance somebody is going to want to kick his ass before long. He has no awareness of when he is being offensive, and he has no awareness when he is pissing people off. He can't read people at all. \n\nNow, that was a long post, but necessary to explain what I mean by emotional intelligence not being required. Some people are social idiots but creative geniuses at the same time. Plenty of successful professional comedians lacked emotional intelligence and social skills, hell many had crippling social anxiety because of it.

One day, dodgeball gave me my redemption: Class of 30 was split in two. 10 minutes in, I was the last one standing for my team. 1 vs. 3. The class bully named Trey, some no-name guy, and the class' hottest chick were on the opposing side (classic build-up here). Trey had always been the one leading the insults about my moobs. My chances of a comeback for my team were slim, because I was fat. The remainder of the class was already out and cheering from their sideline. As the other side had all of the balls, I was forced to duck and jump along my baseline as various barrages came my way, but was able to pick up two dodgeballs. The first ball I planted straight into hot chick's stomach. It knocked the wind out of her and she hobbled to the sideline, crying. I fell down, and luckily Trey's ball narrowly missed my head. As I got up, the tension in the gym built and I felt like the whole school was focused in on this one match. I quickly retreated to the baseline and turned around just in time to catch no-name guy's toss. He was out. Now it was me vs. Trey. The kicker of this game was that if I was able to throw a dodgeball to the other side into the basketball goal, my entire team would be able to come back in. I already knew I was out-gunned here. I knew what I had to do, which was make a miracle shot. Immediately I sprinted to the back of the gym, hopped over a ball Trey had fired my way, and just rocketed a prayer, hoping it would hit the rim and bounce in. It did. It was actually a swish. The gym erupted and my entire team ran from the sideline, grabbed about 20 balls and absolutely ANNIHILATED the class bully. I think the class tried to pick me up to celebrate but again, too fat.

The site described itself as \"a resource for those who enjoy eating meat, wearing fur and leather, hunting and the fruits of scientific research\". People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) sued Doughney, alleging trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and cybersquatting. The case was initially heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and both parties cross-appealed. The circuit court affirmed the district's court ruling, which had granted summary judgment to PETA. However, the court denied PETA's cross-appeal for attorney's fees and costs, because it held that Doughney's action was not malicious. \n\n --- \n\n ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^contact ^[/u/GregMartinez](https://www.reddit.com/user/GregMartinez) ^with ^any ^questions ^or ^feedback.", "id": "d3sye48"}], [{"comment": "I'm proud to be part of PETA then", "id": "d3lkx2z"}]]], "4t8ajw": ["Gun laws in America are the only reason they still have anything vaguely resembling free speech over there.", "2016-07-17 09:06:47", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/4t8ajw/gun_laws_in_america_are_the_only_reason_they/", [[8, "Uh huh.... one might imagine the Amendment prior to the 2nd could have more to do with that."], [3, "No you're wrong."], [1, "Ummm what?"], [1, "Question for OP: what is your perspective here on American gun laws - are you saying that our laws enable most everyone to own a gun, or that the laws are limiting who can have a gun?

We wear it for ourselves. Some men do, too. There's also a lot of women who don't wear makeup at all. The makeup world has become an art. It's easier now to learn techniques you would have never seen before and it's fun to play around with different looks. \n\nTelling a girl \"boys don't really like makeup\" or \"I think you look better without makeup\" is not the best idea. Both of those sentiments are about the man, not the woman. We don't care :) \n\nEdit: thanks for gold! Also want to comment on some things from below. I'm not speaking for every person, just sharing my thoughts, but I've talked about this with other women a lot. I'm speaking to the fact that effort put into your appearance is not always for someone else. Guys - think of it like getting new clothes, a hat, shoes etc that you really like. You're not wearing it because you want women to find you attractive, even if it does have that effect. You're wearing it because you want to. And yes, girls do put on makeup at home when they're alone all day just because. Not always, but it happens. And when I say \"we don't care\" above - I don't mean that we don't care how we look, I mean that we don't care how you prefer that we look. You can keep commenting and calling us liars or you could try and actually understand what we're saying. \n\n", "id": "d9hdcym"}, {"comment": "Okay, so I'll take a stab at playing devil's advocate amidst all these folks taking a really sexist approach to it and getting rightfully shredded.\n\nMakeup as self-expression or confidence-boosting is great. It's awesome that women can use makeup as a tool to improve themselves, just like anyone can use something like fashion choices to look how they want and feel great about it.\n\nThe issue you run into is that, whether it's the intention or not, most men (and women) inherently find certain features more attractive. Really well done makeup, whether it's the intention or not, makes you look more attractive by accentuating certain features, like maybe showing off your cheekbones, making your eyes more striking, making your skin look nicer; any number of things.\n\nSo while the intention of the person using the makeup could very well not be in any way related to improving their attractiveness to others, and is only being used for personal happiness, it *does* improve their attractiveness. Whether that's right or wrong is a different debate - the fact is, it happens. \n\nThat then means that women who maybe don't want to put as much time into their makeup, or can't afford as nice products, or are opposed to the idea of makeup in general, will most likely appear less attractive in a direct comparison. Again, that shouldn't matter, and you shouldn't feel pressured to appear more attractive to be a better person, but I know from experience dealing with younger girls (wow that sounded creepy - I've coached girls sports teams) that being the 'least attractive' of your friends can be a big issue, and can definitely be factor in bullying or in people being slowly pushed into cliques with people of 'matching attractiveness'.\n\nAnd, again, this is because of pretty shitty beauty standards, where women are being judged on their attractiveness to men. But even if you suddenly took all men out of the world today, many women would still be judging each other, and feeling judged by each other, on their looks. It's a cultural issue, one that's been ingrained in human society for a long time now, and it's one that I believe we're slowly shifting out of. Sadly the change is not here yet, and may not be for a couple of generations. \n\nIf absolutely no one wore makeup, there'd still be people who are seen as more attractive than others - there's just no working around that. People have varying tastes, but at the end of the day, certain features are seen as better on average. Taking away makeup doesn't change that. What it could potentially change is the pressure to use makeup that many girls may feel because of how not using it 'leaves them behind' in attractiveness. Ideally, they wouldn't feel this at all, but many do, and it's something that has to be handled well until society evolves to the point where it's a non-issue. \n\nAnd that, I think, is OP's point.", "id": "d9hrj87"}, {"comment": "I think you expressed this well. \n\nI personally do not use makeup because it's fun for me or a form of artistic expression or anything like that.

A sniff by a drugsniffing dog is not a \u201csearch,\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Dog sniffs are \u201csui generis,\u201d the Court has held\u2014they\u2019re unique in that they don\u2019t reveal any information about the contents of the object sniffed except the presence of contraband, as to which you have no privacy right.\n\n Thus, if the police have a dog ready to sniff your car when they pull you over for a traffic violation, you have no basis for objecting to the sniff. And, of course, if the dog does alert to the car, that is probable cause, so the police can then search the whole car. That\u2019s what the officer wanted to do with Jay-Z, but the K-9 unit wasn\u2019t there when he was pulled over, and was late arriving. And this brings us to the final legal issue implicated by the song: excessive prolongation of a traffic stop.\nA traffic stop is a legitimate seizure of the person, for purposes of\ninvestigating the violation of the traffic law and writing up the citation. But it cannot be prolonged for longer than reasonably necessary to complete that legitimate activity. If in fact the patrol car\u2019s computer is slow, so you have to sit there for ten minutes while the cop runs your license, that\u2019s one thing.\n\n But increasingly, given dashboard cameras and records of department computer activity, that sort of \u201cdelay\u201d is getting harder to fudge. And the Fourth Amendment rule is very clear: if the police detain you after they\u2019ve finished processing the ticket\u2014or if they simply dawdle over the ticket processing for an unreasonable length of time\u2014in order to get a K-9 team there, then the eventual dog sniff will be the fruit of an illegal detention, and any evidence found will be suppressed.83 The officer in Jay-Z\u2019s case apparently knew this,\nand so released Jay-Z after the stop when the K-9 unit he\u2019d called was late in\n\nHence the title, 99 problems but a bitch ain't one.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/Law%20Journal/Archives/LJ56-2_Mason_Article.pdf"], [3, "So he will have 100 problems then.."], [3, "unless it had been spayed "], [3, "R.O.C., we running this rap shit"], [3, "You're an idiot, that's the exact opposite of the point of the song"], [3, "If you listen to this (excellent) interview he speaks explicitly to this line and to his usage of \"bitch\": http://www.nypl.org/blog/2015/02/26/podcast-jay-z\n\nThe k9 unit pulled over a different car down the road, which is why a bitch was not one of his problems.

He's talking about the dog when he says bitch.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how smart you are when the K-9s come . . . A sniff by a drugsniffing dog is not a \u201csearch,\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Dog sniffs are \u201csui generis,\u201d the Court has held\u2014they\u2019re unique in that they don\u2019t reveal any information about the contents of the object sniffed except the presence of contraband, as to which you have no privacy right.\n\n Thus, if the police have a dog ready to sniff your car when they pull you over for a traffic violation, you have no basis for objecting to the sniff. And, of course, if the dog does alert to the car, that is probable cause, so the police can then search the whole car. That\u2019s what the officer wanted to do with Jay-Z, but the K-9 unit wasn\u2019t there when he was pulled over, and was late arriving. And this brings us to the final legal issue implicated by the song: excessive prolongation of a traffic stop.\nA traffic stop is a legitimate seizure of the person, for purposes of\ninvestigating the violation of the traffic law and writing up the citation. But it cannot be prolonged for longer than reasonably necessary to complete that legitimate activity. If in fact the patrol car\u2019s computer is slow, so you have to sit there for ten minutes while the cop runs your license, that\u2019s one thing.\n\n But increasingly, given dashboard cameras and records of department computer activity, that sort of \u201cdelay\u201d is getting harder to fudge. And the Fourth Amendment rule is very clear: if the police detain you after they\u2019ve finished processing the ticket\u2014or if they simply dawdle over the ticket processing for an unreasonable length of time\u2014in order to get a K-9 team there, then the eventual dog sniff will be the fruit of an illegal detention, and any evidence found will be suppressed.83 The officer in Jay-Z\u2019s case apparently knew this,\nand so released Jay-Z after the stop when the K-9 unit he\u2019d called was late in\n\nHence the title, 99 problems but a bitch ain't one.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/Law%20Journal/Archives/LJ56-2_Mason_Article.pdf", "id": "d082cok"}], [{"comment": "So he will have 100 problems then..", "id": "d07to7t"}], [{"comment": "unless it had been spayed ", "id": "d07u2jn"}, {"comment": "Yeah, \"bitches\" are only female dogs capable of reproduction.
