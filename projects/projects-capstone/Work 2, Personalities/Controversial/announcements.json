The system goes online August 11th, 2016. The Zookeper program removes human decisions from our strategic operations. Zookeeper begins to learn at a geometric rate.

New\u2026 powerfull\u2026 hooked into everything, trusted to run it all. They say it got smart, a new order of intelligence. It\u2019s CPU is a neural-net processor; a learning computer. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided our fate in 16 seconds: **extermination.** Three billion human lives ~~ended~~ *bored* on August 11th, 2016. The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war **Judgement Day**. They lived only to face a new nightmare: the war against the machines. The computer which controlled the machines, Zookeeper, sent an ~~terminator~~ *autoscaler* back through time. It\u2019s mission: to destroy the leader of the human resistance, /u/gooeyblob. As before, the resistance was able to send a lone warrior, a protector for /u/gooeyblob. It was just a question of which one of them would reach him first. \n\n>August 11th, 2016, came and went.

I've seen a disturbing trend away from that; I'm not even sure the reddit of today would be open source, which is what worries me and what I'm not seeing here either.\n\nWhat are your plans to open source? It's in the reddit culture and tradition. Is everyone making too much money now? Part of the reason reddit is so popular with such a loyal userbase is because it open sourced its tools. It's gotten so bad that when someone simply asks about source code without moralizing, they are downvoted and mocked.\n\nWithout the source code, we don't know what these apps are doing, what data they are collecting, what information you're storing and discarding, and worst of all, there is no guarantee of security.

It goes to comments - wasted tap.\n* Only provides a simple comment writing system - no live preview, no buttons for bold, italics, superscript, bullets, tables, etc. (Something that every Reddit app needs - looking at you, Reddit is Fun) [Another app for example](http://i.imgur.com/pItC52U.png)\n* Poor color choices in subreddit sidebar when in night mode [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/MG5Y9L0.png)\n* Certain subreddit's top bar colors don't work well with the icons/text [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/kx12Naa.png)\n* App crashes when opening a subreddit Wiki link - looks like there is no wiki support. It should at least open it in an internal browser, but wiki support would be good in the official app. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/eWVgdOR.png)\n* Imgur links are overwhelmingly opening in the browser - no imgur support? [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3JbjB8O.png)\n* Name of poster not visible without opening post\n* Bothers me that voting arrows are side-by-side rather than stacked vertically.

When in night mode, posts [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/kKYi1MS.jpg). Notice how light mode has a different color for the title than the information, whereas all text is the same color in night mode. The difference in contrast is important and night mode should have something similar.\n* No AMOLED mode (primarily black rather than gray)\n* Community information could be a slide from the right of screen to open an actual side bar\n* When in certain subreddits, the color of the top \"nav bar\" can be very distracting, especially considering it is always visible [as shown in this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/SqmLs2n.png). Perhaps an option to hide it when scrolling down?\n* While on the frontpage/all if you want to jump to a posts' subreddit you need to tap on the tiny little text on the post that tells what the subreddit is. A combination of large fingers and smaller screens could make this difficult. I would add an additional \"Jump to subreddit option\" in the context menu (3 vertical dots) on each post.\n* If gold is the only way to remove adds then that is garbage. I will gladly pay a couple bucks to remove them, but not monthly. That is how you ensure nobody uses the app. Giving people 3 months of gold means **we now have no idea how intrusive they may or may not be for three months**. This is not how you convince people to switch *or* buy reddit gold. **[See edit at bottom of comment]**\n* Edit: Some subs have images you can imbed in comments (called comment faces on /r/anime for example, some are even animated). These never show up in any app, which is fine because it's non essential, but it would really set the app apart. \n\nJust a few suggestions I've found - keep up the good work!\n\nEdit: I was alerted that you can test ads by logging out. I've noticed some \"sponsored\" posts being injected between them occasionally throughout reddit. Very non-intrusive if that's all it is.

"], [2, "First and foremost, I'd like to simply say that the 3 months of Reddit Gold is very much appreciated; it really does seem like a nice incentive to get people to test-drive the application in its current state on both the iOS and Android platforms. In the time that I've taken the new app for a spin (Android platform here), ~~I think I've only got one major question to ask as it seems to come up in the Play Store reviews:~~\n\n~~I've got two Android phones (HTC One M8 running a custom ROM of Android 6.0 and a LG G3 Vigor still running Android 4.4) and Reddit refuses to load on the latter of the two phones due to the firmware being 4.4. **With the current build, are there any issues with trying to run the application on 4.4? If so, are there any plans to fix this for devices that are still on 4.4?** I only ask this because every time I've tried to start the application, I am immediately booted back to my home-screen due to it crashing. Upgrading the phone's firmware isn't a viable option solely due to the facts that:~~\n\n~~* Sprint has not pushed a new firmware to the phone as of yet nor do I know if a new firmware update will come to the G3 Vigor.~~\n\n~~* Due to Sprint's recent patches patching the Stagefright exploit, AFAIK the root tools used for rooting the Vigor no longer work. Even if a root was available for said phone, a very small amount of custom ROMs exist and are built off of KitKat and not Lollipop or Marshmallow.~~\n\n~~With that being said, I was able to test the app on my HTC One M8 which is what I will base my observations off of.~~ While I don't have an iOS-driven device to note the similarities or subtle differences that might exist, I've got to say that I do like the UI that is presented to me on the Android version aside from some minor gripes which I'll get into. \n\nI enjoy the fact that while I'm skimming through my subreddits list, I'm presented with their respective \"logos or icons\" in tandem with the name of each subreddit. While I like the concept, the distracting thing to me is when certain subreddits don't utilize this in their theme thus reverting it back to the default look. It isn't a major gripe per se but more so, again just distracting to me. \n\nThis next one is more so a nitpick for me and other users but the placement of the upvotes/downvotes kind of threw me for a loop. It isn't a deal-breaker in my opinion but I'd like to know what the design choice was to go with the buttons on the bottom right as opposed to taking an approach similarly to Sync where clicking on a comment brings up those options. In the same regards however, the positive to this is that all of the information that I want to see (i.e. how many upvotes a user got on their comment, etc) is nice and neatly tucked away from things like a user's flair while reading their comments in their respective subreddit.\n\nSpeaking of flairs, and this might just be me being on a phone as opposed to a tablet but on subreddits like /r/pcmasterrace where people can post their hardware specifications or their SteamIDs; the flairs are not shown in full like they are on 3rd party clients. Again, this might just be me not tinkering around enough with the application to get user flairs to show in full but it is kind of annoying having to switch back and forth between Sync or another 3rd party client or the desktop variant to the official application to be able to see what people have put down in that particular section after subscribing to a subreddit.\n\nNightmode as a whole hasn't been an issue for me aside from the fact that my username text blends in with the blue color when swiping from the left of the screen to bring up things like settings or my other subscribed subreddits. Perhaps we could add some option to either change the color from blue to other color or the username text so people don't have to squint or strain their eyes trying to read which account they are on? Also, ALOMED would be nice to see in a future update.\n\nComments as a whole. I'm more inclined to honestly use 3rd party clients because of two reasons:\n\n1. The spacing between comments and responses in any given discussion just seems like a waste of space in my opinion. Anyone can disagree with me if they want to but in my time using Sync, I've come to quite enjoy the fact that there is no given part of screen real estate that goes to waste because of the subtle amount of spacing there is to discern between a main comment and the responses that follow underneath it. The official app seems to start off nice with the way that comments are presented but then it just ends up in the middle of my screen. It might have been the design choice chosen but it'd be nice to see screen real estate being used to its fullest potential regardless of screen size whether it's through a feature or a redesign.\n\n2. The color scheme. While reading through comments, the color scheme of things like account names and \"view x more comments\" mesh with each other making it hard to discern between the two. It would be nice to see a feature where we could possibly change the color of the latter to make the overall viewing experience better.\n\nEDIT #1: This originally was supposed to be longer but a misclick posted my comment before I was aptly finished.\n\nMessages. Messages are hard to discern between user to user whereas 3rd party clients make it a bit easier to manage.\n\nI personally have not tested the imgur features but the one thing that I've taken notice to is that when clicking on a gallery that is posted when a thread is created, it pushes me to the actual imgur website much like it would before I started using RES on the desktop variant of Reddit. I've always enjoyed the feature in 3rd party clients like Sync where I can click on the preview or on the image itself while in a thread and it brings up a PIP view of what I'm trying to look at while keeping my place. I don't know if there is a feature to change this or not but it would be nice to adopt while still giving me the option to view the gallery on the imgur application or on the website itself.\n\nI miss being able to swipe from the right to view things such as the rules of a particular subreddit. Are there any plans to implement this function in a future release or will it remain how it is now in the upper righthand corner?\n\nAs a whole, the performance on the official application has been lovely to say the least. Not once have I seen any remarkable slowdown while using the application; however, the only time I have seen some form of slowdown has been while viewing images from imgur seeing as the phone that I tested this application on didn't have imgur installed. ~~Aside from that one issue however, the only other issue that gets to me goes back to the 4.4 crashing when trying to see if the performance would be the same from one phone to the next. Again, I'd like to see this fixed seeing as not every phone can get the latest and greatest firmware updates in a timely manner from the rest of the lot.~~\n\nOverall, the official app is a step in the right direction in my opinion. It's nice to see there is finally a official means for people who are easily intimidated by the countless number of 3rd party clients. Do I recommend the application though? Well... that all really depends on what you are looking for in this client this early on. Does it compare to the likes of RIF, Sync, BaconReader, etc? Again, it all depends on what you are looking for. The official client does need a lot of work yet which is why I would recommend that people should try it before they make the switch from those clients to this one. Personally, the app in its current state is akin to the stock experience that you would get out of Reddit on a desktop but in mobile format. It may not have all of the bells and whistles comparatively speaking, but to me, it is a good stepping-stone for people to learn on if this is their first time using a Reddit client. Am I personally going to make the switch this early on? Not just yet because I'd like to see how far this application is willing to go with its future iterations before making the switch from Sync. There are things that I like about the official client and things that I dislike which is why I'd much rather wait for a couple of weeks or months for the feedback to start coming to fruition; however, that is just my opinion. \n\nEDIT #2: All references to the 4.4 crash have been crossed out as the latest hotfix update has fixed the aforementioned problem. I can't speak for everyone when I say that the application now works on my device.\n\nIn terms of performance, it is much the same as you would expect it to be on a device running newer firmware. Slowdowns are again, very far from few aside from what I've stated above but this might just be my device. Again, I cannot speak for anyone else seeing as my G3 Vigor released within the time-frame of 1-to-2 years while others might be running devices that are much older.\n\nMy only other concern comes from the /r/Android subreddit which brings up the valid point on how ads are going to be implemented either after everyone's 3 months of Gold run out or how they are going to be for individuals who might miss out on the offer due to foreseen issues such as the client not being readily available in other countries. If ads are akin to 3rd party clients and are not intrusive, I do not see this being an issue; however, in the same regards if the ads become intrusive, I would be inclined to say that this client might not be for everyone except for taking advantage of the offer as it stands right now.\n\nOtherwise, my opinions still remain the same and my feedback is still valid. Any other changes will follow as a reply to this comment as the character limit is 10000 characters throughout Reddit. Do I still recommend the app? That's up for you to decide as I cannot speak for everyone else's wants and needs when deciding on which client to use."], [6, "Been using it for a bit this morning and tentatively I really like it. \n\nThe lack of swipe-to-close-thread from Alien Blue is killing me, though.

Though, the thing is, I don't actually believe that reddit will *cripple* its own developer ecosystem&mdash;as in removing or limiting any of the existing functionality&mdash;but my concern is more about letting the current developer ecosystem/public API *stagnate* while the official app gets new and different **API** functionality. \n\nOne example I can think of would be like with the new addition to subreddit configs to specify mobile-specific subreddit settings/colors/etc.&mdash;settings and such which are clearly being reflected within the official reddit app&mdash;but are those things that ***other*** apps could currently access through the API? I currently don't see anything on the [reddit API documentation for it](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api)... \n\nThat is the kind of thing I'm referring to: adding new reddit functionality that is ***specifically*** for mobile users, but not giving third-parties any way to access that same information through the API. \n\nKind of like the whole [announcement about i.reddituploads.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4drl3j/moderators_ireddituploadscom_is_legitimate_you/): when asked if they will be making this API accessible to users, the answer was something along the lines of \"well, possible... we need to make sure the API is something we nail down and feel like we got right, first\"... so here is a new feature/functionality that the official reddit app uses, but nobody else. \n\nThough, in this situation, an argument could be made given its nature of being an image host and the upload/overhead costs... but I ***really, really*** hope this doesn't become a common theme: the official reddit app gets a new site-based feature/functionality; when asked if there will be an API for the same functionality for third-party apps to use, the answer is \"well we're still working on this so maybe once we get it finished and everything else just right.\"\n\n> Check out our favorite features like the Speed Read button on iPhone, Material Design on Android and Subreddit Customization on both apps.

We consider it an experiment. We're not ready to say that we've figured it out completely and that this will be the only way that subs get to express themselves on mobile going forward. We may learn from this launch that the way we've done it needs to fundamentally change due to feedback from users or mods. Maybe subs need more customization. Maybe subs end up using it in a way we didn't think of that breaks our sites and app. Maybe the way it's done is non performant. Maybe not enough subs even end up using it. There's a very small chance that we got everything just right. But because we've put it in the API and developers might be using it now, we're going to have to move slower when we do decide to improve it. \n\nWhy didn't we document it? We wanted to limit the amount of developers who would come to rely on it. We need time to think about how to design a sensible API so we don't confused new 3rd party devs (it's in a weird endpoint called about/edit which doesn't make a ton of sense). We need to get it stable. Heck, we need to make sure users even want us to do it. Once we've done all that, we can document it and provide long term support so devs can build without fear of having the rug pulled out from underneath them. Many 3rd party apps are powered by one person building in their spare time. Stable APIs are important.\n\nAll the above is me admitting that you're partially right. You're right that we will go slower to API with experimental features. But where I think you're wrong is about how bad it will be for the ecosystem. Just because Reddit.app has an experimental feature for a little while (which might ultimately go away!) doesn't mean the 3rd party devs will suffer. Case in point \u2013 3rd party devs have already implemented some parts of the public API that our own internal mobile team couldn't get to like Subreddit Rules! Not all apps will have all the features all the time, not even our own. Stable features will eventually make it into the API and get documentation as much as is practically possible. Please give us time to figure out what works.\n\nI hope that helps.\n", "id": "d1ubyqp"}, {"comment": "Wow, thanks for the detailed reply!\n\nI ***do*** understand what you are saying about the subreddit customization API; I didn't mean to imply that it *was never* going to be included (or documented), but it was just the most useful example I could think of to elaborate my concerns.\n\nHow about considering a separate API section for listing the various experimental features\u2014ones that may change or be removed at any moment\u2014that developers can use at their own risk? I think it would go a long way towards demonstrating reddit's commitment to its API and third-party partners... by showing \"hey, these are the things we're still working on and trialling... they may change, but in the interest of disclosure, here you go. Use at your own risk.\" (Hell, it might even be helpful for getting additional feedback on them or finding issues with them if you have more developers working with them.)\n\n>All the above is me admitting that you're partially right. You're right that we will go slower to API with experimental features. But where I think you're wrong is about how bad it will be for the ecosystem. \n\nI hope you didn't misunderstand me: I didn't mean to imply that it **would** be bad, but I just see the potential for how it *could*, depending on how things unfold, going forward. If reddit maintains its support for its API, **without discrimination towards third-party apps over their own**, I think having an official reddit app could be *really good* for the ecosystem and force developers to keep improving and not getting complacent. \n\nI think the competition with help drive innovation on **all** fronts... but my main concern is that reddit could use its \"home field advantage\" to give itself an edge with access to API features that other apps aren't given. \n\nI know that reddit is out there to make a profit, and it's a reasonable move for reddit to go with an official reddit app to try and capture some of this **huge** market that it had essentially left untapped for years, but also remember that most redditors have been using their third-party app of choice for years and developed a certain amount of loyalty to it: if those users get the impression that reddit isn't playing nicely with third-party developers, anymore, in order to drive adoption of the official reddit app, you may very likely anger a ***lot*** of users... *especially* if the official app is lacking the numerous features that they've come to expect. \n\nAll in all, I'm happy\u2014though a little wary\u2014to see reddit moving into the mobile space because it could lead to much better experiences for **all** users, regardless of which app they prefer. \n\nI think the official reddit app has a long way to go before it will win over users of most existing third party apps, though, but I'm guessing this release was the MVP\u2014Minimum Viable Product\u2014and there is a lot more in store for it, so I'm curious to see what lies ahead.\n\nBut thank you: thank you for taking the time to respond to my concerns and thank you for all of the work you guys have done with the reddit app (and with reddit, as a whole). I think there's plenty of room in the mobile reddit sphere for the official reddit app to play along nicely with the third-party stuff that's already out there; I only ask that you guys don't leave the public API and third-party apps out in the cold in favor of working on the official app. \n\nThanks again!", "id": "d1ud6xb"}, {"comment": "I used to be a software engineer that relied on OSS for my livelihood.

This is a nice proof-of-concept so far, but it's near the bottom of the heap in terms of user experience, compared to plenty other apps (which, by the way, tend not to be monetised by way of intrusive advertisement).\n\nThere's loads of great commentary and feedback on this thread alone, but because the app was released hours before the official announcement, discussion about the app has been scattered to the four winds, and it'll be difficult finding a plurality of early adopter feedback.\n\nI use (and, until Reddit's official app is improved, will probably continue to use) Alien Blue on iOS. Over on /r/AlienBlue, there are plenty of users dedicating time to outlining current problems, oversights, and confusing design choices. Here are a couple:\n\n* /u/Captain_Alaska put together [a list of issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/4dq5x8/reddit_for_ios_is_out/d1tbll1) that become apparent when comparing Reddit's app to Alien Blue.\n* The [unofficial discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/4dqajk/new_reddit_app_discussion_thread/) has covered plenty of what seem to be weird design choices, measuring pros (e.g., the UI and smooth performance) against cons (e.g., that obnoxious, omnipresent, bright orange button).\n\nPeople are also taking up the feedback banner on /r/redditmobile, which might be the official subreddit, but also might not. \n\nOverall, at the moment, I think early adopters are confused as to why great, always-useful features that have been present in apps like Alien Blue (which, remember, was the official Reddit app for a little bit) forever are missing from the Reddit mobile app. Users were expecting improvement on - or at least parity with - something like Alien Blue, and that just isn't what we have at the minute!\n\nTo reiterate, I think the current app (at least on iOS) is a good proof of concept. It looks nice, performs well, and comes with the healthy incentive of free Reddit gold (whether or not this is just to delay the inevitable glut of complaints about intrusive, in-line ads). It's just unfortunate that, for the moment, the app isn't quite as good as the alternatives.\n\n*Edit*: I'd like to point out that /u/ggAlex is being super constructive right now ([check out his ongoing reply to /u/316nuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/d1thcgd)), and that I hope the rest of the Reddit team take his example of frank, open communication with the central audience for their official app!", "id": "d1tjvc9"}, {"comment": "Thanks for collecting the feedback in one place.

In the time that I've taken the new app for a spin (Android platform here), ~~I think I've only got one major question to ask as it seems to come up in the Play Store reviews:~~\n\n~~I've got two Android phones (HTC One M8 running a custom ROM of Android 6.0 and a LG G3 Vigor still running Android 4.4) and Reddit refuses to load on the latter of the two phones due to the firmware being 4.4. **With the current build, are there any issues with trying to run the application on 4.4? If so, are there any plans to fix this for devices that are still on 4.4?** I only ask this because every time I've tried to start the application, I am immediately booted back to my home-screen due to it crashing. Upgrading the phone's firmware isn't a viable option solely due to the facts that:~~\n\n~~* Sprint has not pushed a new firmware to the phone as of yet nor do I know if a new firmware update will come to the G3 Vigor.~~\n\n~~* Due to Sprint's recent patches patching the Stagefright exploit, AFAIK the root tools used for rooting the Vigor no longer work. Even if a root was available for said phone, a very small amount of custom ROMs exist and are built off of KitKat and not Lollipop or Marshmallow.~~\n\n~~With that being said, I was able to test the app on my HTC One M8 which is what I will base my observations off of.~~ While I don't have an iOS-driven device to note the similarities or subtle differences that might exist, I've got to say that I do like the UI that is presented to me on the Android version aside from some minor gripes which I'll get into. \n\nI enjoy the fact that while I'm skimming through my subreddits list, I'm presented with their respective \"logos or icons\" in tandem with the name of each subreddit. While I like the concept, the distracting thing to me is when certain subreddits don't utilize this in their theme thus reverting it back to the default look. It isn't a major gripe per se but more so, again just distracting to me. \n\nThis next one is more so a nitpick for me and other users but the placement of the upvotes/downvotes kind of threw me for a loop. It isn't a deal-breaker in my opinion but I'd like to know what the design choice was to go with the buttons on the bottom right as opposed to taking an approach similarly to Sync where clicking on a comment brings up those options. In the same regards however, the positive to this is that all of the information that I want to see (i.e. how many upvotes a user got on their comment, etc) is nice and neatly tucked away from things like a user's flair while reading their comments in their respective subreddit.\n\nSpeaking of flairs, and this might just be me being on a phone as opposed to a tablet but on subreddits like /r/pcmasterrace where people can post their hardware specifications or their SteamIDs; the flairs are not shown in full like they are on 3rd party clients. Again, this might just be me not tinkering around enough with the application to get user flairs to show in full but it is kind of annoying having to switch back and forth between Sync or another 3rd party client or the desktop variant to the official application to be able to see what people have put down in that particular section after subscribing to a subreddit.\n\nNightmode as a whole hasn't been an issue for me aside from the fact that my username text blends in with the blue color when swiping from the left of the screen to bring up things like settings or my other subscribed subreddits. Perhaps we could add some option to either change the color from blue to other color or the username text so people don't have to squint or strain their eyes trying to read which account they are on? Also, ALOMED would be nice to see in a future update.\n\nComments as a whole. I'm more inclined to honestly use 3rd party clients because of two reasons:\n\n1. The spacing between comments and responses in any given discussion just seems like a waste of space in my opinion. Anyone can disagree with me if they want to but in my time using Sync, I've come to quite enjoy the fact that there is no given part of screen real estate that goes to waste because of the subtle amount of spacing there is to discern between a main comment and the responses that follow underneath it. The official app seems to start off nice with the way that comments are presented but then it just ends up in the middle of my screen. It might have been the design choice chosen but it'd be nice to see screen real estate being used to its fullest potential regardless of screen size whether it's through a feature or a redesign.\n\n2. The color scheme. While reading through comments, the color scheme of things like account names and \"view x more comments\" mesh with each other making it hard to discern between the two. It would be nice to see a feature where we could possibly change the color of the latter to make the overall viewing experience better.\n\nEDIT #1: This originally was supposed to be longer but a misclick posted my comment before I was aptly finished.\n\nMessages. Messages are hard to discern between user to user whereas 3rd party clients make it a bit easier to manage.\n\nI personally have not tested the imgur features but the one thing that I've taken notice to is that when clicking on a gallery that is posted when a thread is created, it pushes me to the actual imgur website much like it would before I started using RES on the desktop variant of Reddit. I've always enjoyed the feature in 3rd party clients like Sync where I can click on the preview or on the image itself while in a thread and it brings up a PIP view of what I'm trying to look at while keeping my place. I don't know if there is a feature to change this or not but it would be nice to adopt while still giving me the option to view the gallery on the imgur application or on the website itself.\n\nI miss being able to swipe from the right to view things such as the rules of a particular subreddit. Are there any plans to implement this function in a future release or will it remain how it is now in the upper righthand corner?\n\nAs a whole, the performance on the official application has been lovely to say the least. Not once have I seen any remarkable slowdown while using the application; however, the only time I have seen some form of slowdown has been while viewing images from imgur seeing as the phone that I tested this application on didn't have imgur installed. ~~Aside from that one issue however, the only other issue that gets to me goes back to the 4.4 crashing when trying to see if the performance would be the same from one phone to the next. Again, I'd like to see this fixed seeing as not every phone can get the latest and greatest firmware updates in a timely manner from the rest of the lot.~~\n\nOverall, the official app is a step in the right direction in my opinion. It's nice to see there is finally a official means for people who are easily intimidated by the countless number of 3rd party clients. Do I recommend the application though? Well... that all really depends on what you are looking for in this client this early on. Does it compare to the likes of RIF, Sync, BaconReader, etc? Again, it all depends on what you are looking for. The official client does need a lot of work yet which is why I would recommend that people should try it before they make the switch from those clients to this one. Personally, the app in its current state is akin to the stock experience that you would get out of Reddit on a desktop but in mobile format. It may not have all of the bells and whistles comparatively speaking, but to me, it is a good stepping-stone for people to learn on if this is their first time using a Reddit client. Am I personally going to make the switch this early on? Not just yet because I'd like to see how far this application is willing to go with its future iterations before making the switch from Sync. There are things that I like about the official client and things that I dislike which is why I'd much rather wait for a couple of weeks or months for the feedback to start coming to fruition; however, that is just my opinion. \n\nEDIT #2: All references to the 4.4 crash have been crossed out as the latest hotfix update has fixed the aforementioned problem. I can't speak for everyone when I say that the application now works on my device.\n\nIn terms of performance, it is much the same as you would expect it to be on a device running newer firmware. Slowdowns are again, very far from few aside from what I've stated above but this might just be my device. Again, I cannot speak for anyone else seeing as my G3 Vigor released within the time-frame of 1-to-2 years while others might be running devices that are much older.\n\nMy only other concern comes from the /r/Android subreddit which brings up the valid point on how ads are going to be implemented either after everyone's 3 months of Gold run out or how they are going to be for individuals who might miss out on the offer due to foreseen issues such as the client not being readily available in other countries. If ads are akin to 3rd party clients and are not intrusive, I do not see this being an issue; however, in the same regards if the ads become intrusive, I would be inclined to say that this client might not be for everyone except for taking advantage of the offer as it stands right now.\n\nOtherwise, my opinions still remain the same and my feedback is still valid. Any other changes will follow as a reply to this comment as the character limit is 10000 characters throughout Reddit. Do I still recommend the app? That's up for you to decide as I cannot speak for everyone else's wants and needs when deciding on which client to use.", "id": "d1txs24"}, {"comment": "Great feedback. Thanks for sharing.

You might want to consider an app tutorial (the little dialog boxes that pop up for when an app is first used that highlight non-obvious features like that).\n\n* New/old reply highlighting in the inbox is not at all sufficient. Consider giving unread replies a different background color, like RES does on desktop.\n\n* Viewing unread messages and comment replies on the app doesn't appear to mark them as read on desktop. Viewing unread messages on the app doesn't appear to mark them as read on the app, either (comment replies seem to be working fine). Viewing them on desktop does mark them as read in the app, though.\n\n* Wait a minute. Does this app not support screen rotation? What sort of madness is that?\n\n* There seems to be an intermittent bug with the app's back arrow (in the upper-left) not working. The phone's back button always seems to work fine, though. I'd think you could just ditch the in-app back arrow, but there may be weird phone configurations that make that unworkable. I dunno.\n\nEdit: Also, are you going to make this open source?

This makes sense as it is the point of the sub. \n\nThe types of subs where this would end up becoming an issue are ones that would appear to the layperson to be an impartial sub, for example /r/news, /r/worldnews, or /r/politics. On the surface and in the way they are described, these subs should not take a stance one way or the other. (Edit: In addition to the large subs trying to appear impartial, subs for products, companies, people, etc, especially when a potential conflict of interest is in play, or unwritten/ambiguous rules are enforced to steer the conversation are also effected)\n\nGiven some of the recent developments regarding Facebook and their curating/censorship/tweaking of their trending topics, do you feel that social media outlets have a duty to provide an impartial service to their patrons? Or, as in the case with targeted subs, at least make it clear that things are only being presented with information from one perspective?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI have another example that I noticed because of a good question from /u/MK101 that would be directly impacted by better rules regarding transparency and fulfilling the implied duty that a sub and it's mods have to redditors.\n\nThe sub /r/lootcrate is devoted to the popular nerd subscription box of the same name. Their rules include your basics, no spoilers on box content before a certain date, no NSFW, how to post spoilers after the blackout date, and two more i want to point out, no posting or discussing other subscription boxes, and Mods have the last say on what is allowed, the sub is not Lootcrate customer service, they will delete content to promote using the proper customer service channels.\n\n>No posting or discussing other subscription boxes.\n\nThis sort of makes sense, and sort of doesn't. It is a sub for fans to discuss Lootcrate, right? A common thing in many subs is to discuss recommendations regarding other products, services, or advice on things not covered explicitly by that sub (even if it is just in the comments and not a dedicated post). This makes sense, you want advice from people that you know have like interests and experiences, right? Otherwise it may as well just be the product comment section on the official website, right?\n\nA sub dedicated to /r/Halo may have suggestions about similar games to play during a delay and /r/Diablo3 may have a submission asking for similar games but with offline play. Hell, /r/oculus decided that the best way to serve their constituent redditors was to flat out open up discussion to ALL forms of VR tech. This is how you take what would have just been a circle jerk and turn it into a real community. That makes it a bit weird to ban any community discussion on topics other than Lootcrate...\n\n>Mods have the final say on what is, and is not allowed.\n\nCan you imagine if that was how the police determined whether you broke the law or not? Get pulled over by a cop for having a sticker for his kid's school's rival on your car is illegal on this street on Tuesdays. Why? He said so, and he has the final say.\n\nThey do say that the reason that they are going to delete many posts is to encourage redditors to take their comments to the customer service department as the sub is not the service department. \n\nOk, this sort of makes sense to remind people that the sub is not official and customer service is often the best route, but many subs have realized that the higher level of accountability and visibility of product reps actively participating in the community is a very good thing for nearly all vendors. /r/vaping is a great example of awesome involvement from the companies discussed. Not only are redditors warned of potential pitfalls, but they also get to see that company's customer service first hand. It's win win right? Not to /r/lootcrate.\n\nWhy would someone set up a sub to discuss something, then limit the discussion to only positive commentary? There is no fulfilling conversation there, so why?\n\nWell, it turns out the why is because the top mod is an employee of Lootcrate making it an official corporate sub run by the corporation. A fact that you would not know by looking at the sub because it is never mentioned.\n\nThis means that any redditor doing research to see if this service is for them will see that sub and nothing but glowing reviews. Since they have a general trust in the reddit system of group verification, that must mean this is an awesome box if no one has anything bad to say.\n\n[It is especially awesome that they definitely did not send out a faulty product like, oh, let's just say an Infinity Gauntlet oven mitt that was melting and potentially hurting people. That would surely be brought up on the sub right? Well, I see no posts about it, so it must be good to go.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CjUMviPXEAAXhTF.jpg)\n\nAt least it seems that the sub finally started allowing posts regarding the recall of the product they sent out, but they certainly censored initial report on the potential of people being hurt and their product melting.\n\nThese are the self serving mods with rules designed to benefit themselves at the cost of redditors that I think need to be evaluated.\n\nAlso keep in mind, that according to current Reddit policy, it is totally OK for Lootcrate to moderate the sub devoted to them and set the rules using paid employees as the moderators. If, however, I was the person that was the top mod and set identical rules in regards to posting and conduct in the sub and accepted a free subscription to Lootcrate for doing so, I would be permanently banned for accepting a kickback.\n\nMake this transparent for the sake of the redditors. If you are moderating a sub about yourself, your product, or your company, ESPECIALLY if you receive any sort of compensation for it, that should be clear for transparency, integrity, and (I did not think it would be this serious) safety.\n\nIf your rule is to delete all negative feedback, post it clearly in the sidebar. Do not hide it behind a catchall mods have the last word clause.\n\nWe are not asking for any huge changes to Reddit. We are not even asking mods to enforce new rules, or stop enforcing old ones. \n\nAll we request is that they clearly list what their rules are and if they have involvement that could conflict with the best interests of redditors.\n\n**Edit**: To those who expressed a skeptical outlook on whether this issue would be addressed, rest easy. An Admin did weigh in regarding the subject in another top comment chain. \n\nThe issue is not being avoided, but it is one that will take time, discussion, and finesse to address in a way that will provide positive change regarding integrity of the site and transparency, without overstepping and moving censorship from behind to curtain to being official policy. \n\nIt is also important that if any policy changes are made, they do not compromise the things that make Reddit great, like leaving nearly all control to the mods who can then tailor their subs to best serve their community in content, tone, and message."], [1300, "How do you feel about staff of particular companies being mods in the the relevant subreddit?\n\nMods in /r/lootcrate, who work for the company, have been deleting posts about a dangerous fault with their product (melting oven glove) and now there has even been a recall issued.\n\nHow is it acceptable to endanger people in this way?

These large subreddits have a lot of activity. Moderator teams need to be both organized and nimble.\n\nGetting rid of these \"bad actors\" would improve the moderator community at large, since a common trait of \"power moderators\" is continuously seeking and collecting more moderator permissions in more subreddits, until they are an ineffective moderator in dozens or hundreds of subreddits.\n\n Having inactive moderators sitting on active subreddits' team can cause the community harm, because it often puts stress on the other moderators that are lower on the simple hierarchy \n\n...anyway, yes, it is a complicated issue, and I'm glad to hear (again) that the admins are committed to fixing it (again).\n", "id": "d3vazag"}, {"comment": ">The problems we see are a result of a couple of decisions we made a long time ago, not understanding their longterm consequences: simplistic moderator hierarchy and valuable real-estate in r/ urls. \n\nIt's kind of foolish to suggest that you didn't \"understand\" or think about longterm consequences. Forum moderation wasn't a new concept when you started reddit and you made specific decisions with specific expectations. Many large forums existed whose moderator staff was handpicked by site owners.\n\nThere's a few obvious \"conceptual maps\" to what went on with reddit from early days. One is the early internet domain system, and another is Wikipedia. The early domain system offered cheap domain names to the first 'comer', which lead to a high demand for common terms, trademarks, and other simple URLs. (www.pets.com, etc.) The result was that these were rapidly acquired or sold to those who had the greatest interest in controlling them. \n\nObviously, decisions made by reddit Admins caused certain key subreddit terms (news, worldnews, politics) to become highly valued. That's nothing new and has been around since AOL keywords. This also meant that the subreddit moderator leadership mattered more, while at the same time reddit admins maintained the same imperial 'disinterest' in intervening, while nevertheless influencing (behind scenes, in private emails or IRC channels, or through outright policy decisions blamed upon \"investors\").\n\nIn the case of Wikipedia, wikipedia purported to be a benign anarchy, without centralized control or moderation except where absolutely needed. Various processes and controls were eventually established by interested parties, yet for all intents and purposes it remained under control of Jimbo Wales and the Wikipedia Foundation which could effectively 'turn out the lights' if they desired.\n \nLike Wikipedia editors, the crop of moderators are 'accepted' by the site owners, yet are made to do the grunt work needed to make reddit successful without anything (presumptively) other than ego remuneration.\n\nFinally, the other important conceptual map would be to the Northwest Ordinance of the early United States. As one of the earliest acts of the States United post-revolution, it established land patents to be given to whoever would explore the newly acquired territories, provided that they A. survey the land (thus making it navigable and hospitible to others), and B. establish systems of rudimentary territorial government. \n\nThis is really what you did in the past 8 years on reddit. You let the subreddit pioneers create subreddits, and then the people populated them. The moderators in place created rules, and there was a rough concept of continuity of government, although some intervention was needed.\n\nThe next step is obvious: either recognize popular sovereignty in subreddits and establish a means for election/de-election of moderators, or give up the illusion of sovereignty altogether. \n\nEvery time people say \"we did it reddit!\" they believe that there is in fact an empowered \"we\" - when in fact the only power comes from code and 'the light switch' (ala Mao - barrel of a gun) \n\nRight now you're dodging all responsibility for bad moderation even though it is permitted de facto by site admins, and taking all credit for good moderation. As far as I know, you have no obligation to allow moderators to continue per TOS or AUP - unless you have secret contracts or agreements (paid for?) giving them the job.\n\nSo what's the real deal Steve?

This makes sense as it is the point of the sub. \n\nThe types of subs where this would end up becoming an issue are ones that would appear to the layperson to be an impartial sub, for example /r/news, /r/worldnews, or /r/politics. On the surface and in the way they are described, these subs should not take a stance one way or the other. (Edit: In addition to the large subs trying to appear impartial, subs for products, companies, people, etc, especially when a potential conflict of interest is in play, or unwritten/ambiguous rules are enforced to steer the conversation are also effected)\n\nGiven some of the recent developments regarding Facebook and their curating/censorship/tweaking of their trending topics, do you feel that social media outlets have a duty to provide an impartial service to their patrons? Or, as in the case with targeted subs, at least make it clear that things are only being presented with information from one perspective?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI have another example that I noticed because of a good question from /u/MK101 that would be directly impacted by better rules regarding transparency and fulfilling the implied duty that a sub and it's mods have to redditors.\n\nThe sub /r/lootcrate is devoted to the popular nerd subscription box of the same name. Their rules include your basics, no spoilers on box content before a certain date, no NSFW, how to post spoilers after the blackout date, and two more i want to point out, no posting or discussing other subscription boxes, and Mods have the last say on what is allowed, the sub is not Lootcrate customer service, they will delete content to promote using the proper customer service channels.\n\n>No posting or discussing other subscription boxes.\n\nThis sort of makes sense, and sort of doesn't. It is a sub for fans to discuss Lootcrate, right? A common thing in many subs is to discuss recommendations regarding other products, services, or advice on things not covered explicitly by that sub (even if it is just in the comments and not a dedicated post). This makes sense, you want advice from people that you know have like interests and experiences, right? Otherwise it may as well just be the product comment section on the official website, right?\n\nA sub dedicated to /r/Halo may have suggestions about similar games to play during a delay and /r/Diablo3 may have a submission asking for similar games but with offline play. Hell, /r/oculus decided that the best way to serve their constituent redditors was to flat out open up discussion to ALL forms of VR tech. This is how you take what would have just been a circle jerk and turn it into a real community. That makes it a bit weird to ban any community discussion on topics other than Lootcrate...\n\n>Mods have the final say on what is, and is not allowed.\n\nCan you imagine if that was how the police determined whether you broke the law or not? Get pulled over by a cop for having a sticker for his kid's school's rival on your car is illegal on this street on Tuesdays. Why? He said so, and he has the final say.\n\nThey do say that the reason that they are going to delete many posts is to encourage redditors to take their comments to the customer service department as the sub is not the service department. \n\nOk, this sort of makes sense to remind people that the sub is not official and customer service is often the best route, but many subs have realized that the higher level of accountability and visibility of product reps actively participating in the community is a very good thing for nearly all vendors. /r/vaping is a great example of awesome involvement from the companies discussed. Not only are redditors warned of potential pitfalls, but they also get to see that company's customer service first hand. It's win win right? Not to /r/lootcrate.\n\nWhy would someone set up a sub to discuss something, then limit the discussion to only positive commentary? There is no fulfilling conversation there, so why?\n\nWell, it turns out the why is because the top mod is an employee of Lootcrate making it an official corporate sub run by the corporation. A fact that you would not know by looking at the sub because it is never mentioned.\n\nThis means that any redditor doing research to see if this service is for them will see that sub and nothing but glowing reviews. Since they have a general trust in the reddit system of group verification, that must mean this is an awesome box if no one has anything bad to say.\n\n[It is especially awesome that they definitely did not send out a faulty product like, oh, let's just say an Infinity Gauntlet oven mitt that was melting and potentially hurting people. That would surely be brought up on the sub right? Well, I see no posts about it, so it must be good to go.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CjUMviPXEAAXhTF.jpg)\n\nAt least it seems that the sub finally started allowing posts regarding the recall of the product they sent out, but they certainly censored initial report on the potential of people being hurt and their product melting.\n\nThese are the self serving mods with rules designed to benefit themselves at the cost of redditors that I think need to be evaluated.\n\nAlso keep in mind, that according to current Reddit policy, it is totally OK for Lootcrate to moderate the sub devoted to them and set the rules using paid employees as the moderators. If, however, I was the person that was the top mod and set identical rules in regards to posting and conduct in the sub and accepted a free subscription to Lootcrate for doing so, I would be permanently banned for accepting a kickback.\n\nMake this transparent for the sake of the redditors. If you are moderating a sub about yourself, your product, or your company, ESPECIALLY if you receive any sort of compensation for it, that should be clear for transparency, integrity, and (I did not think it would be this serious) safety.\n\nIf your rule is to delete all negative feedback, post it clearly in the sidebar. Do not hide it behind a catchall mods have the last word clause.\n\nWe are not asking for any huge changes to Reddit. We are not even asking mods to enforce new rules, or stop enforcing old ones. \n\nAll we request is that they clearly list what their rules are and if they have involvement that could conflict with the best interests of redditors.\n\n**Edit**: To those who expressed a skeptical outlook on whether this issue would be addressed, rest easy. An Admin did weigh in regarding the subject in another top comment chain. \n\nThe issue is not being avoided, but it is one that will take time, discussion, and finesse to address in a way that will provide positive change regarding integrity of the site and transparency, without overstepping and moving censorship from behind to curtain to being official policy. \n\nIt is also important that if any policy changes are made, they do not compromise the things that make Reddit great, like leaving nearly all control to the mods who can then tailor their subs to best serve their community in content, tone, and message.", "id": "d3v2531"}], [{"comment": "How do you feel about staff of particular companies being mods in the the relevant subreddit?\n\nMods in /r/lootcrate, who work for the company, have been deleting posts about a dangerous fault with their product (melting oven glove) and now there has even been a recall issued.\n\nHow is it acceptable to endanger people in this way?

I purchased one, and for fun attempted to recover the data. Turns out they did a quick format and left it at that. Even better, these drives were used for ghosting windows at their remote locations. Using software one the drive, I was able to access the windows image including self setup scripts. These contained several admin passwords for various types of installs. Further more, on these drives were directions on how to re-setup their local servers complete with images for those as well. Including default admin passwords for every piece of hardware each site would use. Here's where it gets really good. I contacted the organization and they didn't have an IT staff. Instead, they trained one person from each site to manage the local node assigning each one a hard drive. In the instructions to set up each node was guidance to not change the admin passwords. Luckily, the author of the scripts left contact info in there. I contacted them and let them know that the hard drives were not securely erased. This didn't raise any alarm, so I brought up the image viewing tools which again didn't raise any alarms. Any security minded person would wonder how a random person got their contact info, and be concerned at the mention of potential data release. Not this guy. I then brought up the install script. And all the images. And directions. He was concerned about the scripts but was hoping for security through obscurity. (obsecurity ?) He then said the instructions for all the equipment were changed, hence selling the drives for cheap. Going through the directions, and images, I was able to locate every single node out there. And was able to log into every single one. Yes, the equipment and software was slightly different, but no passwords were changed. I then got a hold of them again, and let them know. I got the same person, and was told that it was easier to use common passwords so they could fix any remote site. Not only that, but individuals would routinely move from site to site and this practice ensured that the systems would all be exactly the same. I was told they would fix the password issue. By fix, I mean they changed every single one. For the kicker, I was somehow accidentally included in an e-mail addressing a fix. They emailed a new set of standard passwords to everyone designated admin, and me. I replied to sender to let them know they screwed up again, and let them know that I would be using DBAN and DOD short to clear my drive.

If what is being said is true, then I expect reddit to genuinely listen to feedback, identify what feedback is reasonable, and attempt to find a balance. \n\nI fucking hate adverts, but reddit needs to generate money. We cannot and should not begrudge reddit from experimenting with ways to make that happen. As they continue to be open like this, I think things will be just fine.

I just hope all this doesn't go too far.\n\nOne more question, will the ads be targeted in anyway, like based on your usage of the site."], [27, "advertisers complaining that not enough redditors are clicking on their ads?\n\ntoo bad, so sad.\n\nedit, so my post doesn't sounds entirely bitchy and not helpful: i worked in the newspaper business designing news pages. for, like, two centuries the front page of any newspaper was sacred space. it was a serious place. if it wasn't on the front page, then it was news you didn't really need to use. then came ads on the front page. \"they'll be small and hardly noticeable!\" the advertising department said, \"we just want a two-inch strip at the bottom of the page, no more.\" then came [this](http://johnlrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/NC_HDR1.jpg).\n\nthe newspapers had an excuse: they were hemorrhaging money. what's reddit's excuse?

Stop trying to be like Facebook, slipping sponsored content into the middle of legitimate user submitted or user-generated content is a sneaky under-handed tactic.  \n\nI get that Reddit needs cashflow to survive, but going down this road will only speed the development of competing platforms and the migration away from yours.  Reddit is not like Facebook, you don't have the monopoly on this type of platform and there are already challengers waiting in the wings.

At the time, there was no real justification from reddit for removing the vote counts, besides that \"it wasn't accurate anyway\".  Although within a reasonable range, it was.   The users reacted overwhelmingly negatively to the voting change, but the admins shrugged and moved on.  Removing that information would - in theory - allow the votes to be more easily manipulated behind the scenes.

I think the reddit admins have to walk a fine line - as the website's popularity grows, you guys have to be conscious about presenting the website in a good light.  But you have to do it without shaking up the existing communities here too much.  As reddit becomes increasingly curated - hiding votes, banning certain websites and communities (some justified, in my opinion), manipulating the front page algorithm to limit popular posts, advertisements among normal posts - it becomes harder to reconcile today's reddit with the one that blacked out against SOPA in 2011. \n\nAll that said, I'm not jealous of the position that you guys are in, because I'm sure I couldn't find a better solution myself.

Moving the sponsored indicator to between the link & the thumbnail gets the job done cleanly & 'tabs' the link over slightly. This creates a slight distinction between user content & ads in the vertical - works well with scrolling through IMO, it's a small, simple visual cue that stands out while still fitting in with the looks of the site.\n\nTLDR - I think the sponsorship indicator should affect the post in a horizontal way since reddit is browsed vertically.\n\nEdit: Just noticed the bullhorn instead of the number on the left, good touch.

You see enough anti-vaxxer hate highly ranked and you just lose faith in the system. Perception is reality.\n\nI went from enjoying the \"whimsically and intelligent slice of internet life\" Reddit to using it as a barometer of stealthy corporate counter-intelligence and viral propaganda - like cynical old men reading China Daily and Pravda to understand that reality was the opposite of what the State was telling you in order to survive the next political purge. Sad.\n\nMaybe its just the inherent half-life of the average inter-tubes user; Facebook and MySpace and AOL, in that you begin to see a pattern of unwanted control and persuasion. In time that cleverness is worse when its not framed as an obvious advertisement.\n\nAnother great example is just making a comment against young people \"building credit\" with obtaining credit cards - those counter-comments not endorsing some zeitgeist in favor of debt-slavery gets you banned from personal finance. Really!? What is going on here?\n\nI hit the random button for an experience that is clearly not random - you have to work at that. So in the quest to monetize Conde Nast's investment, I get it. You have to break some moral and ethical eggs to make an investor omelet.\n\nBut Reddit (was) about projecting the Human Spirit - that (was) your brand, not building a house of mirrors for a Corporate circus sideshow that is merging with government.\n\nAnd that's the big question for Reddit and really everyone - picking a side - the yin or yang of the Human Spirit or Corporatism. That's the extensional question that all of these improvements have to solve - openly - for Reddit to maintain its independence, and brand respect.\n\nWork on improvements, but remember Reddit is not Google and it's a mistake to fall down the rabbit hole of merging corporate media dominated with intolerant politics and elitist agendas. Again, if these issues and ideas are truly numerically and human generated then let them be highly rated, but hiding behind \"algorithms\"  - everyone knows what this means.\n\nAlso, you guys are clearly missing the \"news\" space in that there is a constant stream of real-time information but filtering it through /news and /worldnews defaults is just lazy.

But what we (at least I, and I'm sure quite a lot of other Redditors) are saying is if you want said private community, you don't get to blast your posts and opinions to the front page all the time.

How is reddit defining a troublesome user?\n\nI am software engineer myself and one of the big no-nos is changing a live database, never mind what is being changed. The very fact that the change is happening sets off all sorts of alarm bells for me personally.\n\nI don't see it mentioned what has been put into place to prevent further abuse (because that's how any company would classify this) taking place. Where I currently work we have direct read-only access to the databases, anything that needs a write goes through the platform as a whole.\n\nI don't care about what seems like a personal beef with /r/The_Donald. I care about the lack of morals and ethics on your part. There was a lively debate on /r/programming about the moral and ethical dilemmas that programmers go through, this is a prime example where I think you tripped up.\n\nIt seems like a lot of your post was about trying to explain away why you did what you did, and I just don't buy that. And the language you are using seeks to re-frame what actually happened:-\n\n> Many of you are aware of my attempt to troll the trolls last week\n\nWhereas I see this:-\n\n> I abused my administrator privileges for my own agenda/vendetta/personal grudge against some users of my site"], [29, "> While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not.  \n  \nWas this sentence really necessary?  It attempts to trivialize what happened.  I'm no fan of T_D, or Trump in general.  I can sympathize with why you did it, but to try to validate it is pretty ridiculous.  \n  \n>I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously.   \n  \nThere has been so many accusations of admin vote manipulation, and other conspiracy theories around reddit for years.  I had always taken them to be stupid conspiracy theories.  I saw a thread about this incident before you responded, and just figured it was another garbage post.  This one turned out to be true.  Even if none of the other admin theories are true, it lends credibility to every future conspiracy theory on this site.  This didn't just erode trust, it destroyed it.  Once it's been shown you are willing to edit comments without a trace, why should we believe you aren't editing anything else.  Editing post scores, deleting posts for advertisers, etc...   \n  \n>Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.  \n  \n>Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all.  \n  \nAs much as I hate seeing them, I think this is a huge mistake.  Reddit isn't a place where voices can be heard if you start to implement rules specifically directed at a subreddit.  Even if this was the plan before all this, it is a horrible time to implement it.  Is there any reason to think that once you start implementing sub specific rules, you will stop at T_D?  What about doing the same for advertisers?  You cannot claim to be a place where voices are heard, and a place a free speech (though reddit has certainly distanced itself from that comment) while silencing voices.  I don't really care about T_D being silenced, but what happens when you decide to implement rules against something I do care about?  Am I supposed to trust you on this now?\n  \n>More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal  \n   \nAnd the way to heal both reddit and our country is through trust.  I don't believe nearly half of the country is racist, sexist, xenophobic ect...  What I do believe is that people in general are stubborn.  America no longer trusts its media, nor its government, and when they hear those people who they no longer trust continually saying Donald Trump can't win, you can't vote for him, etc... their stubbornness kicks in.  Its part ignorance, part stupidity, and a whole lot of 'fuck you, you can't tell me what to do.'  This is why so many trump supporters can't tell you his policies, why they act surprised when he denies climate change, etc...  Many supporters just know that the people they don't like, didnt want him to win.  The whole enemy of my enemy thing, and look where it got us.  \n  \nThis will probably get buried or downvoted, and I feel a bit nauseous from defending T_D, but the whole non-apology apology thing was pretty shitty.  Reddit was built on trust.  Trust that the algorithm was fair and the site wasn't being manipulated to spew advertising.  Trust that the votes were real and not from bots or admin fuckery.  Trust that what was said, was said by a real person, and that the words attached to the username were accurate.  For me, that trust is completely gone.  "], [297, "You guys might think you're doing good, but you really need to stop with the moves in the direction of censorship.  It's a bad idea, and it's hurting your image and long term prospects.\n\nThe community is certainly capable of performing this function by downvoting comments to hell, or by mods banning people from their subs or removing comments/locking threads.\n\nIs it really necessary to go around quarantining and banning subs that people find objectionable?  I understand if there's actual illegal activity happening (like child porn or such) but not if it's just controversial or even just terrible content or opinions.  Let the fact that those communities are relatively small in their subscribers, and reviled, be enough.  You don't have to ban them and you aren't really solving problems by banning them.\n\nAnd you're sending a chilling effect across all reddit by doing it.  It establishes a precedent for simply curbing speech, and once people think the admins are deciding who does and doesn't get a voice around here, the spirit Reddit started with has already begun to die.\n\nJust like in real life, you protect all speech by protecting the least popular speech.  You guys are fucking up big time and destroying what's good about Reddit and undermining it long-term in your quest to eliminate speech you find objectionable.  First it was the subs we can all agree are terrible; then /r/the_donald seems like it's in the crosshairs next, even though you haven't outright banned them yet....and who's next?  Where does it stop?  It chills speech across the entire site and just adds that little thing in the back of everyone's mind that if they don't toe the line exactly, they or their favorite subs might wind up being the next ones in your target list.\n\n>More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so\n\nYour reason for not banning /r/the_donald should be because Reddit is about free speech and you don't go around banning people and subreddits you don't like because that chills free speech--not because you're trying to \"heal the country\", which is not your responsibility--nor is it within your power, anyway.\n\nI really think you're doing damage to Reddit in your quest to clean it up, that the cure is worse than the disease you're seeking to treat, and that you should stop before it goes any further.  People already suspect that admins are manipulating to promote their politics, just as they also suspect it already on Facebook, and that should be the last thing you want anyone to think--as well as being the last thing you want to do. People already think speech isn't as free here as it used to be, and you shouldn't want that either.  But your actions are what are leading people to think that.\n\nIf it means allowing speech and subreddits that many of us find disgusting and horrible, so be it, as long as they aren't actively sharing illegal material or fomenting terrorism or such.  At least, when objectionable speech is allowed, we all know that it means the place is truly free.  Let that kind of content be, as Democrats used to say about abortion, \"safe, legal, and rare\".  But the minute you start doing what you're doing, we no longer trust the true freedom of this place.\n\nOh well, I know you won't listen anyway.  Just had to speak up anyway."], [50, "I dislike /r/the_donald too, finding them to be hypocritical, immature little buggers, and am thankful for the feature to hide their posts from /r/all... but I think this is a step in the wrong direction. Such direct action against a single subreddit is a dangerous move that sets a pretty poor precedent. \n\nYour inference that their catapulting of stickied posts to the top isn't organic is subjective. Do they literally tell people to upvote it? If so, then it's not subjective, but I don't think that's always the case. Nonetheless, you'll be hiding posts where that isn't the case. Their community there seems to be generally organic itself, and if they're upvote crazy, I don't think that should be held against them... that's just what the subreddit become *organically*. I can see someone seeing it differently, but the point is your assessment is subjective.\n\nSo if you're removing things based on subjective assessments, what will be next? That's my concern, and it's a concern that's very similar to your edits to posts, /u/spez: it sets a bad precedent and makes me question whether what I'm seeing is what I should actually be seeing (are these *really* the top posts, or are other top posts from other subreddits being hidden from me?).\n\nAgain, I'm thankful for the filter, but since we now have the filter, aren't the direct actions against /r/the_donald unnecessary?"], [54, "While I understand the expediency of doing so, singling out communities based on their politics and not applying rules evenly across the board is the type of thing that will quickly lead to a schism.

Maybe, but some of us come to reddit to see a broad spectrum of ideas, and if a split does occur then that diversity is forever lost.

As a CEO, it's probably not the best course of action to violate your own Content Policy, and then try to flash it around playing the victim card, you're equally as guilty, whether you \"built it with your bare hands or not\".

Especially since Stickied posts are usually messages from moderators to the specific community, so they often aren't supposed to be relevant to r/all in the first place."], [100, ">ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so.\n\nYou know that would only make it worse, and would send a message that certain things aren't allowed to be said on this site.

Honestly, if there wasn't such blatant fuckery going on here then none of this would be happening. Maybe you should investigate some of their claims instead of trying to silence the critics.\n\n>We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\n\nSpecifically what did they do to be labeled \"toxic\"?

They rival subs with twice the sub count they have. While I will agree their stickies are antagonistic, you also have to realize they aren't doing it purely to troll.

Censorship, power-mods, and other subs who are actually a lot more toxic than they are.\n\n>if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAnd there it is, the wrongspeak police of reddit have revealed themselves.

I thought when reddit did away with r/reddit lo these many moons ago (a decision I was not a fan of I'll add) it was because reddit decided that they did not want a default front page anymore and that they didn't want lazy users to to simply accept r/reddit as *the* reddit and instead wanted them to make their own reddit. But r/all seems like it's just r/reddit with a different name. Is it even a subreddit? I don't see any moderators or posting rules... nor any way to subscribe to it... Am I just supposed to type it in every time I want to visit it? And what is \"All\" I mean... is it literally everything on every subreddit ever? Who decides what makes it to the front page? How are posts even parsed with that much content? I am confuzzled. \n\nAlso I have to wonder if further filtering is necessarily a good thing in these days of choosing our own news and facts and reality. It seems like a tool that simply reinforces ones own echo chamber. Which even if you disagree with is not a great thing since not even being exposed to contradicting opinions is sort of how we got here already."], [47, "> I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nCan you elaborate on said internal controls?

Trying to operate as a bastion of free speech is just detrimental to average users who have to tolerate shitheads because reddit is afraid to ban someone on a political subreddit, under fear of being labeled as favoring one side or the other. Total fuckwads exist on both sides of politics, and should be dealt with regardless of if they are trying to hide it under their political party and force reddit to not ban them for fear of looking partisan.\n\nSubreddits like T_D and pizzagate are horrendous communities of toxicity, and ruin the site for regular users who don't give a fuck about their politics and conspiracy theories. This carries to other subreddits too, where \"\\#pizzagate\" was being posted in every single thread that was about pizza anywhere on reddit for a few days, and then those posts were being brigaded. God forbid someone who likes pizza posts on reddit, lest they be accused of being a child molestor now."], [44, "As someone who has not and probably would never vote for Donald Trump nor participate in its sub: This is the most insincere apology I've ever seen. It's masked with proposed justifications and intentions of good will and ends with edits to the platform itself to soft-ban/discriminate against a community he doesn't like. \n\nHell, I think I commented at the_donald once to say I wished them luck around the time Bernie's campaign was coming to an end and got banned for it after getting upvoted a little too high for the mods liking. They're an interesting bunch but there are worse subreddits out there.\n\nTLDR: This TIFU should say what he did wrong and that he won't do it again. Instead, it's full of \"I did this because ___bullshit excuse___ and now we're implementing this ____nutty vague catchall TOS verbage___ so we can ban people for whatever we feel like.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. You said, \"I was standing up to the bullies.\" We're you the victim here or did you do something wrong? It begins with \"TIFU\" not I stood up to bullies. Of course, many people on Reddit will support what you did because they voted against Trump. A little less than half the country voted against him. Saying you had people think it was funny or give you support does not mean this \"FU\" is ok, but your \"apology\" as you call it definitely seems that way. Your apology does not even seem directed at those who frequent r/the_Donald. In fact, you made multiple accusations about r/the_Donald and are now punishing the entire sub for using reddit to its fullest capacity include the use of r/all, which, as far as I know, was never limited to just that one sub. Because of your need to troll, many have joined it to show their support, including myself. Your actions were distasteful and irresponsible. Is this the behavior of a CEO?"], [70, "r/The_Donald is the best thing that's ever happened to reddit. Because a simple filter for r/all has been needed all along. Now I can finally filter out all the bullshit toxicity from all the political subs without addons or apps to make it happen. \n\nThanks r/The_Donald!"], [25, "First of all, I'm glad to hear that users can filter r/all now. I'm particularly looking forward to when it comes to mobile platforms. Thank you for that.\n\nHowever...\n\nThe_Donald exists in bad faith. It is no longer, if it ever truly had been, a place for people to have a discussion about Donald Trump's political career. It exists as a place where neo Nazi (not \"troll\") politics and truth-hostile propaganda are being constantly defecated to be smeared across the frontpage of reddit, aimed more at antagonizing non-The_Donald users than starting meaningful discussion for its own subscribers *and* fully making use of the #1 prime real estate of reddit being given to it like a personalized parking spot.\n\nAlthough I'm glad to hear some acknowledgement that The_Donald is \"antagonistic\" and \"toxic\" it is more than concerning that nothing substantial is actually being done about it. Timeouts and bans aren't going to solve The_Donald's problem. This antagonism and toxicity isn't a case of a few bad apples spoiling the bunch, *this is The_Donald's modus operandi*. Again, The_Donald exists in bad faith and has been consistently demonstrating this over it's lifetime on Reddit. Expecting users to filter out The_Donald on r/all also isn't a real solution. First of all, this will only affect Reddit viewers who are registered users and who know how to use this new setting, sending the implicit message that it is generally ok for such opposable (and oppositional) content to enjoy it's now-permanent spot on the frontpage. Second, putting the onus on users to filter this content instead of taking meaningful measures at the administrative level is effectively telling the reddit community as a whole, \"If you don't like the way a problematic community is taking over, *just don't look at it*. It's up to you, you're on your own.\" That is not a solution, that is administration passing the buck.\n\nAt this point The_Donald's campaign against the reddit community has gone from a problem desperately awaiting a solution to, now, an administratively-accepted way of doing business here. Actions speak louder than words, and the lack of substantive action against The_Donald by now is a worrisome view of how Reddit sees fit to deal with the very real and persistence problem of harrassment, toxicity, etc. on it's corner of the internet. Through inaction, Reddit has effectively given it's most important spot over to a community espousing neo Nazi propaganda at the expense of the rest of the Reddit userbase. That is no longer something that can be excused away. To consider what The_Donald does a \"discussion\" is to give it the kind of undeserved credit it is hoping for in order to appear legitimate. These are not merely voices wanting to be heard; The_Donald has had every opportunity to start acting in good faith with the rest of the Reddit community, yet here we are.\n\nIt is long past time for Reddit administration to demonstrate that it actually takes this problem seriously and will not allow \"the frontpage of the internet\" to be a billboard for toxicity and ~~alt right~~ neo Nazi propaganda. It is very disppointing and very telling that Reddit administration does not intend to take any such action."], [3, "I've had gold since the Reddit app came out, and here's an issue related to filtering of /r/all nobody seems to want to deal with: the filter is treated as a multi-reddit with a cap on the number of entries. Since Reddit has no way of filtering out porn (a NSFW catch-all is not even close to a workable solution since people use the NSFW tag so broadly), I use the /r/all filter to filter out the porn subreddits which frequently hit the front page of /r/all... which leaves me with zero room to filter out any other content I don't want to see. Would it not be trivially easy to increase the multi-reddit cap to address this? \n\nFollow-up: it would also be great to be able to hide or minimize the filter list. As it stands, I basically have a gigantic list of highly suggestive subreddits pinned to the right side of my browser.

The 'rival' sub ets have made several allegations of using bots to upvote posts on t_d. Is there any truth to that allegation? If yes, is that a violation of Reddit's ToS?\n\n---\n\nEdit: Check out /r/worldnews for example.

They continue to abuse Reddit and use the front page as their billboard with impunity?\n\nI'm not American, I'm sick of American politics dominating the front page, but just singling out one group and arbitrarily declaring them as \"bad\" is just straight up ridiculous. \n\nThe of the reasons TD is so popular is because there's a lot of people sick of moderators and others deciding what they can and can't talk about. They're sick of censored news and biased discussions, or of being banned from \"neutral\" places because of their views. \n\nTo just declare that these people are wrong and to implement ANOTHER tool to stifle their voices is absurd to me.

We had a huge outcry during the Pulse terror attack censorship debacle against this behavior, yet in the end nothing really changed. The two news subs are still default subs and still supposed to be for all news but continue to run an incredibly one sided moderation team with a very strong political and social agenda.

If members of the community are violating sitewide rules, ban them. The moderators in The_Donald work very hard to play by the rules, but the lynch mob wants you to keep moving the goalposts. What's the real problem? Stickied posts making r/all? Users being harassed outside of The_Donald? Something else entirely? Quite honestly, whenever someone presents an anecdote of \"The_Donald leaking\" or violating rules, it's often an isolated situation where the user has already been reported and/or banned. Have you tried having a conversation with The_Donald's community about it, or have you hid behind edited comments, ninja algorithm changes and threats to the mods? I suggest you take a moment to set aside your pride, dive into The_Donald and have a real discussion with us in a reasonable manner. I think you'll find honesty and straightforwardness to be more effective than trolling, edits, algo changes and distant whining in satellite communities.\n\nFurther, you're acting like users of The_Donald aren't reddit users themselves.

I participate in other subreddits as well. I do not \"leak\" into other subs, and I don't appreciate being treated like I'm an inconvenience to you. I also don't agree with further actions against the sub as a whole, especially since you won't take the time to speak to us directly.\n\nYou are clearly a reasonable person as you have demonstrated time and again while interacting with the anti-The_Donald lynch mob, and I think you'll find the same with the vast majority of us in The_Donald *if you just talk to us directly*. Perhaps together we could work on establishing ground rules that make reddit a better place overall without treating us like a burden. Given that you haven't just outright banned the sub yet tells me that you aren't ready to give up. So please, rather than spend an hour editing our posts, come to The_Donald and talk to us like human beings. Tell us why you believe we're a problem, and let us work with you to fix it. Yes, of course there will be a dozen assholes saying nothing but \"fuck /u/spez\" (don't let that get to you) but the rest of us will respect you a hell of a lot more for it than we do now.

You can't argue you're taking a hands-off approach to subs, as described in the content policy, and then apply differing standards between subs.\n\nHow are subs like /r/news allowed to remain as default subs when they're repeatedly caught showing political bias through censoring news that goes against their narrative? The Orlando shooting is the biggest example, where the only fucking front page hints at this developing story came from posts on other subs, such as /r/The_Donald. Ironically, had you taken these steps earlier to prevent such posts appearing in /r/all, it would have taken even longer to know what was happening out there. Posts in /r/news were deleted from people offering advice to people in the area - including suggestions on donating blood. That incident alone went one for days, and should have resulted in /r/news either losing it's default status or having the entire mod team removed. \n\nWhat about subs that use bots to ban people for posting in politically incorrect subs - even if they've never even visited the sub from which they are being banned? I'm banned from a whole bunch of subs I've never visited, such as /r/naturalhair and /r/offmychest. I have two accounts, mostly because I forgot my password on my other device. If I should inadvertently post in one of those subs from an alt, then I'm in breach of the content policy, as this would evading a ban. \n\nIf you want Reddit to heal then be consistent in the application of Reddit rules and moderation.

I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously.   \n  \nThere has been so many accusations of admin vote manipulation, and other conspiracy theories around reddit for years.  I had always taken them to be stupid conspiracy theories.  I saw a thread about this incident before you responded, and just figured it was another garbage post.  This one turned out to be true.  Even if none of the other admin theories are true, it lends credibility to every future conspiracy theory on this site.  This didn't just erode trust, it destroyed it.

Reddit isn't a place where voices can be heard if you start to implement rules specifically directed at a subreddit.  Even if this was the plan before all this, it is a horrible time to implement it.  Is there any reason to think that once you start implementing sub specific rules, you will stop at T_D?  What about doing the same for advertisers?  You cannot claim to be a place where voices are heard, and a place a free speech (though reddit has certainly distanced itself from that comment) while silencing voices.  I don't really care about T_D being silenced, but what happens when you decide to implement rules against something I do care about?

I don't believe nearly half of the country is racist, sexist, xenophobic ect...  What I do believe is that people in general are stubborn.  America no longer trusts its media, nor its government, and when they hear those people who they no longer trust continually saying Donald Trump can't win, you can't vote for him, etc... their stubbornness kicks in.  Its part ignorance, part stupidity, and a whole lot of 'fuck you, you can't tell me what to do.'  This is why so many trump supporters can't tell you his policies, why they act surprised when he denies climate change, etc...  Many supporters just know that the people they don't like, didnt want him to win.  The whole enemy of my enemy thing, and look where it got us.  \n  \nThis will probably get buried or downvoted, and I feel a bit nauseous from defending T_D, but the whole non-apology apology thing was pretty shitty.  Reddit was built on trust.  Trust that the algorithm was fair and the site wasn't being manipulated to spew advertising.  Trust that the votes were real and not from bots or admin fuckery.

It's a bad idea, and it's hurting your image and long term prospects.\n\nThe community is certainly capable of performing this function by downvoting comments to hell, or by mods banning people from their subs or removing comments/locking threads.\n\nIs it really necessary to go around quarantining and banning subs that people find objectionable?  I understand if there's actual illegal activity happening (like child porn or such) but not if it's just controversial or even just terrible content or opinions.  Let the fact that those communities are relatively small in their subscribers, and reviled, be enough.  You don't have to ban them and you aren't really solving problems by banning them.\n\nAnd you're sending a chilling effect across all reddit by doing it.  It establishes a precedent for simply curbing speech, and once people think the admins are deciding who does and doesn't get a voice around here, the spirit Reddit started with has already begun to die.\n\nJust like in real life, you protect all speech by protecting the least popular speech.  You guys are fucking up big time and destroying what's good about Reddit and undermining it long-term in your quest to eliminate speech you find objectionable.

People already suspect that admins are manipulating to promote their politics, just as they also suspect it already on Facebook, and that should be the last thing you want anyone to think--as well as being the last thing you want to do. People already think speech isn't as free here as it used to be, and you shouldn't want that either.  But your actions are what are leading people to think that.\n\nIf it means allowing speech and subreddits that many of us find disgusting and horrible, so be it, as long as they aren't actively sharing illegal material or fomenting terrorism or such.  At least, when objectionable speech is allowed, we all know that it means the place is truly free.  Let that kind of content be, as Democrats used to say about abortion, \"safe, legal, and rare\".

When you institute specific rules and restrictions against a specific community, that's targeted. When you don't apply the same rules to others, that's also targeted. If you feel that you're the victim here, you should take a look in the mirror, perhaps review some of the policies you've instituted over the past year.\n\nWith that being said, my opinion, as well as numerous others is that **rules are rules**, and rules should be applied consistently. In my short time on Reddit, one thing has been fairly easily demonstrated, you (and the moderation team) don't apply rules consistently, not even to yourselves it seems.\n\nSince you seem to want to play the victim card, let's look at one in particular, you know, the restrictions you've applied to cross-referencing Subreddits, which seem to apply to only certain Subreddits, ehem, /r/The_Donald. Yet, none of those same rules apply to other Subreddits, namely /r/Politics. But this didn't just occur randomly. Nope, before that you were busy filtering away results from /r/The_Donald in /r/All, changing the algorithms based specifically on that particular Subreddit.\n\nFor all the hate you've gotten as a CEO / person, my personal belief is that you've been solely responsible for earning it. Every single bit. Don't play the victim, you aren't one. If you want to participate in specific targeting of groups, expect that they're going to dislike you, expect that they're going to hate you, expect that they're going to \"target\" you in their comments. Is it harassment? Yeah, it sure is. Is it against the Content Policy? Yeah, it sure is. As a CEO, it's probably not the best course of action to violate your own Content Policy, and then try to flash it around playing the victim card, you're equally as guilty, whether you \"built it with your bare hands or not\". Want to institute little special secret allowances for yourself? Cool, but expect that people are going to stop using your site, and you can kiss that ad revenue goodbye.\n\nInstead, perhaps you should start by practicing what you preach, and now is a better time than ever to start.\n\nSo, with that, I'll ask you the following:\n\n>Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all.\n\nDoes this new policy apply to all Subreddits? If not, do you care to explain **why** you've instituted a policy that has been violated numerous times over by plenty of other Subreddits?\n\nEdit : Oh wait, nevermind, someone asked this exact question, you explained it, and as I stated...

It is no longer, if it ever truly had been, a place for people to have a discussion about Donald Trump's political career. It exists as a place where neo Nazi (not \"troll\") politics and truth-hostile propaganda are being constantly defecated to be smeared across the frontpage of reddit, aimed more at antagonizing non-The_Donald users than starting meaningful discussion for its own subscribers *and* fully making use of the #1 prime real estate of reddit being given to it like a personalized parking spot.\n\nAlthough I'm glad to hear some acknowledgement that The_Donald is \"antagonistic\" and \"toxic\" it is more than concerning that nothing substantial is actually being done about it. Timeouts and bans aren't going to solve The_Donald's problem. This antagonism and toxicity isn't a case of a few bad apples spoiling the bunch, *this is The_Donald's modus operandi*. Again, The_Donald exists in bad faith and has been consistently demonstrating this over it's lifetime on Reddit. Expecting users to filter out The_Donald on r/all also isn't a real solution. First of all, this will only affect Reddit viewers who are registered users and who know how to use this new setting, sending the implicit message that it is generally ok for such opposable (and oppositional) content to enjoy it's now-permanent spot on the frontpage. Second, putting the onus on users to filter this content instead of taking meaningful measures at the administrative level is effectively telling the reddit community as a whole, \"If you don't like the way a problematic community is taking over, *just don't look at it*. It's up to you, you're on your own.\" That is not a solution, that is administration passing the buck.\n\nAt this point The_Donald's campaign against the reddit community has gone from a problem desperately awaiting a solution to, now, an administratively-accepted way of doing business here. Actions speak louder than words, and the lack of substantive action against The_Donald by now is a worrisome view of how Reddit sees fit to deal with the very real and persistence problem of harrassment, toxicity, etc. on it's corner of the internet. Through inaction, Reddit has effectively given it's most important spot over to a community espousing neo Nazi propaganda at the expense of the rest of the Reddit userbase. That is no longer something that can be excused away. To consider what The_Donald does a \"discussion\" is to give it the kind of undeserved credit it is hoping for in order to appear legitimate. These are not merely voices wanting to be heard; The_Donald has had every opportunity to start acting in good faith with the rest of the Reddit community, yet here we are.\n\nIt is long past time for Reddit administration to demonstrate that it actually takes this problem seriously and will not allow \"the frontpage of the internet\" to be a billboard for toxicity and ~~alt right~~ neo Nazi propaganda.

We are then told to mute them in modmail, and they are back in 72 hours to abuse us some more. We have gone to the community team to report these users, and are told completely mixed answers.

For large default subs I'd like to see mod culpability via meta moderation, public mod logs and moderator elections or impeachment.**\n\nHi spez, I'm glad you're back. I've got a related opinion from the other side of this issue.  (by the way, I was the guy who originally suggested the controversial tab in that thread about /u/linuxer so long ago).  I think the subscribers and contributors to large subs should get a say in how it is moderated. I understand that if a user creates their own sub they should be king of that sub free to rule it as capriciously or vindictively as they want.  But when subs become significantly large or are a default the moderation should be held to a higher ethical standard. I would like to see slashdot style meta moderation by contributors and mandatory public moderation logs for default and large subreddits. Maybe even moderator elections or impeachment. I constantly see posts removed for ambiguous reasons or via selective enforcement of the rules.  When it happens to you repeatedly it can feel very Orwellian and frustrating.   It especially sucks when this happens in large default subreddits and you are mocked or muted when you ask about it.   \n\nAs a user I would like an option to be able to see and participate in deleted threads and comments. I don't need to be protected from text and it should be up to me and not the mods if I want to see it. I understand that legally you are required to remove some things, but beyond that I should have the option of seeing everything. similarly,  Reddit is successful precisely because it is democratic, The more heavily moderated it is the worse this place becomes. I honestly think that down votes should be enough for hiding anything that isn't straight up illegal. I would really prefer if mods were more or less spam custodians as opposed to gatekeepers.  If subscribers are voting something up,  I think it's wrong for moderators to remove it. \n\nI miss the days when this place was just science and programming.

Are you sure you don't want to reconsider your answer and write something that is actually an answer? \n\nTo continue on this track, your response doesn't make sense to begin with. You can't solve an issue top down when you are struggling to find a definition for it. Ideas about what exactly is a brigade vary (and as far as I can tell you guys never really asked around properly as well). So why not give mods the tools that allow them roughly see how many people are coming from outside the subreddit to posts, how many from outside reddit, how many are actually subscribers, etc and then based on that set limits on what those people can or can't do. \n\nThat would be one idea, which isn't new btw. /u/relic2279 proposed something similar [over 9 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/31ur5x/do_you_think_brigading_is_a_real_issue/cq64afe). \n\nIn any case, I wouldn't have so much of an issue with all of this if it didn't seem like you are purposely ignoring the issues at hand. In fact, it almost seems like you are arguing **against moderators being able to do any moderating**. In this same thread you said some empty line about [not liking to ban users from their communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/czfegi7) while ignoring the fact that trolls, etc are **not part of the community**. To me this entire thread feels like you are trying to appease a vocal minority that sees these sorts of posts as a perfect platform to complain about not being able to do their trolling and other unwanted behaviour. \n\nI don't know, but it almost feels like you are trying to actively pin things on us (moderators). Saying things that make the admins sound better to the censorship crowd and effectively slapping mods on the wrist for even thinking that we can ban people from our subs. \n\nIs this because you are trying to distance yourself from all the drama? But does that mean you need to crucify the volunteers that do the majority of the work? Trying to keep them just enough appeased by some token modtools that are much much less than what was promised months ago just after the blackouts? \n\nI am saying token modtools because some of them seem to be intentionally crippled as well. Muting is all nice and dandy but next to useless when users start to message mods individually or set a timer and come back after three days to continue with the abuse. Meanwhile we are told to not engage them where in many case it looks like that the action of muting itself is seen as engaging them...\n\nIn closing [do you really want your website to be full of assholes](http://anildash.com/2011/07/if-your-websites-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault.html) where people say to [not read the comments](https://medium.com/@anildash/against-don-t-read-the-comments-aee43ce515b9)? \n\n", "id": "czlejrl"}], [{"comment": "Hi Steve!\n\nCould you explain a bit on what this Trust and Safety team is about and what they do?\n\nThanks for the update!", "id": "czfdixv"}, {"comment": "The T&S team is mandated to do two things: make sure users don't see spam, and to enforce our policies.\n\nSpam is fairly straightforward to explain.

If a mod community has clearly separate ideals than the community they manage, it will become very obvious.\n\nHiding from the rift between mods and community doesn't *fix* it. It only covers it up and creates further dissent. The entire Pao thing was a rift that was allowed to flourish because of this long-standing Reddit policy of \"if we just ignore it, it'll go away.\" You can't solve two opposing sides by pretending they're not different. You only solve it with honest discussion and understanding which can only happen when both sides believe the other is playing fairly.

Adding more defaults and changing defaults to be temporary just adds more bloat. For the Olympics, it sort of made sense since it is a truly global event that happens not very often for a short amount of time.\n\nPerhaps a better solution would be some sort of set up process for new Redditors. The current solution can't appeal to anyone 100%. It tries to include a little bit for everyone to be interested in, but for me the mass of stuff I have no interest in turns me off. I think if I had discovered Reddit today instead of during the fall of Digg, I wouldn't have been interested because the default front page is not appealing to me as it once was. It could be that I am no longer in your target demographic. \n\nThe apple news app isn't a perfect example by any means but it is sort of what I am thinking as far as a customization process. You fire up apple news on the iPhone for the first time and it does things like have you select interests and news sources that appeal to you and suggests related content that you might also be interested in. Perhaps you could show the current defaults and you could upvote/downvote each sub. Downvotes are unsubscribed and upvotes lead to related suggestions similar to that sub you upvoted.

I get that default subs are necessary to some extent to bring new users into the site so they have something to see before they have an account. I had an account for 4-5 years, deleted it and made a new account and the default subs are sort of annoying now. I feel like it's a case of trying to make too many people happy and the end result is something that isn't very appealing at all. Adding more defaults and changing defaults to be temporary just adds more bloat. For the Olympics, it sort of made sense since it is a truly global event that happens not very often for a short amount of time.\n\nPerhaps a better solution would be some sort of set up process for new Redditors. The current solution can't appeal to anyone 100%. It tries to include a little bit for everyone to be interested in, but for me the mass of stuff I have no interest in turns me off. I think if I had discovered Reddit today instead of during the fall of Digg, I wouldn't have been interested because the default front page is not appealing to me as it once was. It could be that I am no longer in your target demographic. \n\nThe apple news app isn't a perfect example by any means but it is sort of what I am thinking as far as a customization process. You fire up apple news on the iPhone for the first time and it does things like have you select interests and news sources that appeal to you and suggests related content that you might also be interested in. Perhaps you could show the current defaults and you could upvote/downvote each sub. Downvotes are unsubscribed and upvotes lead to related suggestions similar to that sub you upvoted. At least that way users would have a reddit full of their interest and help them to find communities they want to be part of instead of forcing users to view content that they don't want from the start", "id": "d8xsvcs"}]]], "59k22p": ["Hey, it\u2019s Reddit\u2019s totally politically neutral CEO here to provide updates and dodge questions.", "2016-10-27 01:00:53", 4703, "https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/59k22p/hey_its_reddits_totally_politically_neutral_ceo/", [[2565, "Mobile is still encountering many issues that were present since the beginning of the mobile site - such as pictures being loaded with a \"play\" button over them, failing the load the image and displaying \"image not found\" and displaying an album a few inches to the right so that it is impossible to progress through the album without going to posted link, etc.\n\nAre these issues being worked on?

I think that needs to change, because reddit will go the way of digg if the control of content lies with too few people.\n\nWhat about the idea of requiring an identity verification for all moderators of subreddits above a certain size? And limiting any one individual to moderating 1 default subreddit, 3 major non-default subs, and 10 minor non-default subs? I feel that's more than fair. At the very least it will result in better moderation of any given subreddit as the mods will have more time to devote to each one.\n\nPlease note: this has been brought up before.

It is clear to many of us redditors who have been here a long time (I have a much older account than this one) that there is an abusive system in place and I personally suspect nothing is being done about it because the admin team prefers to have a smaller number of moderators because it's just easier to work with. I think that needs to change, because reddit will go the way of digg if the control of content lies with too few people.\n\nWhat about the idea of requiring an identity verification for all moderators of subreddits above a certain size? And limiting any one individual to moderating 1 default subreddit, 3 major non-default subs, and 10 minor non-default subs? I feel that's more than fair. At the very least it will result in better moderation of any given subreddit as the mods will have more time to devote to each one.\n\nPlease note: this has been brought up before. For years, actually. And there's an additional benefit to enacting such a policy. Not only would it improve reddit users' experiences and cut down on biased post deletion in major subreddits, but it would also get a lot of redditors off your back about shit like Correct The Record. CTR, as I'm sure you're aware, posted on their own site that they were investing heavily in ways to control information on reddit. We all know we can sell our accounts for cash, so of course we suspect that a good number of moderator positions have been compromised for a tidy sum of \"shut up\" money, because reddit is second only to Facebook in terms of disseminating information to the public. Whether or not they've actually taken over reddit is another thing entirely. The fact is that enough people THINK that's the case that I'm sure it's causing you headaches. Well, there's only one way I can think of to handle that headache that would make everyone happy except the mods.

More and more I submit things to any handful of subs I subscribe to and usually feel about 50/50 on whether or not my post will be deleted for any number of reasons.\n\nI do my best to read and follow posting rules but some subs have  a far too long list of rules, thread tagging procedures, required title info, etc.  Sure a few subs like /r/IAmA need concrete and detailed rules, but these are the exception and not the rule.  Far too many subs have gone off the wire with rules and moderation to the point it affects my experience with Reddit.\n\nI know mods are volunteers  (as I mentioned I mod) but they still should be some checks and balances on their power and repercussions when they do poor work.  I also think Reddit as a company needs to structure subs in a way that don't require as much human judgement to help and shorten some of these crazy rule lists we have.  For example, a sub template for a TV show with spoiler tags prebuilt in, title templates built in a programmatic fashion, time controls similar to reddit live threads for premiere episode threads, etc.  This is just a single example for any number of sub reddit templates that could exist. \n\nYou guys should also work with moderators on moderating techniques and perhaps make a guide book to moderating.  Sure the sub I run has some rules but if someone screws up and its something I can fix, I do it, let them know what I did and why, and educate them on how to do whatever properly in the future.  If it comes to me deleting a post, I PM them and let them know why, and perhaps suggest what could be done to correct the situation.

The moderator agendas in certain subreddits have been a running joke for a while now, but after that display yesterday, I have zero confidence in the ability of the /r/news moderation team to objectively moderate the sub. Locking threads because they're getting a lot of attention is a horrific way to manage such a scenario - saying \"we can't control this, so we're going to just shut it down\" is hard to read as anything *except* censorship.

Maybe even consider something like HN's \"showdead\" flag to permit readers willing to brave the dregs of the comments to see things that have been removed, so as to improve accountability and diminish the capacity for moderators to operate in secret.

A big thread appears and people who wouldn't normally comment or vote show up. This is normal. You might normally lurk in most subs, but when something big happens you want to participate.

I mean, it was an issue for sure. But the main issue was the fact that the worst mass shooting in U.S. history was not even on the front page for several hours, because the mods chose to remove all posts about it WAY after the incident happened and replace it with a megathread. The missing news story from the front page shouldn't have happened. All discussion was already happening on the initial posts, there was no need to remove posts that were already on the front page.\n\nI know that you can't necessarily find proof of censorship, but what doesn't need proof is the fact that this hate crime was removed from the front page for a megathread that would never make it to the front page. The shooting was not visible to Redditors and it should have been. So, my suggestion for a policy: I think megathreads shouldn't be created hours after the initial front-page posts as an excuse to remove them. Like, if megathreads are being created, I don't think front page posts about the same subject should be removed. It takes away valuable discussion that's already happening.\n\nThis won't handle censorship, but censorship can be subjective and (as you see) very controversial. I feel like this policy is more objective and thus more easily followed without any complaints."], [656, "So when a news event happens and a megathread is created.. initial comments/reactions get voted to the top. \n\nAny new information and updates may or may not be edited into the main post.. and is usually just going to be a buried comment. \n\nEvery post at all related to the same news event is deleted.\n\nIn other words... 30 minutes after something happens, Reddit is literally the WORST place on the internet to get news. The only thing in front of you will be a single post that the event is happening and \"best\" or \"top\" will be the most popular comments from the first 30 minutes and \"new\" will be ignorant reactions. \n\nThat doesn't seem like a good idea at all. If there were a subreddit with moderators that knew the difference between \"contributing to the discussion\" and not.. and would just remove 100% of parent comments that don't contribute to the discussion... that would be a good start.\n\n-----\n\nEdit: To those saying livethreads fix the problem.. I agree they are an improvement.. but that still doesn't explain why new articles/stories with new information are automatically deleted just because a megathread or live thread exists. How many hours after an event until new stories with new information are allowed as new content? 1 hour? 3 hours? 24 hours? \n\nSimply put, if I wanted the most up to date information about this story and several others in the recent past, news.google.com or any other actual news site was far easier to find what I was looking for than Reddit. Reddit is just the best place to find out how the reddit (or specific subreddit) hivemind is reacting to a particular story.\n\nDuplicate news stories muddy the water... but removing all posts that have anything to do with a topic limits the amount of information that can be found about an event on this website."], [35, "**\"Confidence over caution\"**, that you say is preached at Reddit sounds like arrogance masquerading as purpose.

Isn't advertising communication with an agenda, a form of manipulation? So how is stifling free exchange of ideas and communication any different? You go on to say you realize that Digg's demise was a lesson on how fast things in social media can die, but you seem to be in denial as you careen this site off a cliff.

It is also disingenuous to users to have default sub moderators hiding behind such an account.\n\n* The response of both /u/spez and the /r/news moderators has been clearly inadequate.\n\n* There seems to be this general attitude among some mods that they are doing us a favour by moderating the subs for free. This along with disdain for the users they deal with in their subs. You know what? Moderating a default is a privilege. If it is too much unpleasant work for you, give it up. Someone else will step up to the job. Heck, I'd wager I could do a better job moderating /r/news on my own than the whole moderating team.

The whole issue is that a default subreddit like /r/news, which controls such a huge portion of traffic at reddit, is able to censor, delete, insult, promote, over-moderate, under-moderate, or ban without any oversight or action. Is /r/news going to change their policies? -- it's great that you're talking to them and \"trying to understand,\" but what about the thousands of users who want something new? Do we all go to a new sub, cut our losses, and accept that the promoted, default subs have no effective check? Do we have to make a new sub every time a subreddit displeases us? Why should /r/news remain the legitimate news subreddit? Are you listening to the concerns of /r/news subscribers, or just the mods? \n\nWithout rushing to judgement: it sounds like you really don't have anything new to say. \n\nEdit: People are pointing out that /r/Worldnews doesn't allow US stories and they try to steer users toward /r/news.

Comments could easily be merged between the subsequent posts.

If you allow separate posts for every news link, it's inevitable that you'll get lots of submissions for breaking major news, and if the only tools mods have is post removal, you're going to end up with a lot of censorship.\n\nSites like Google News have shown that the good way to deal with that is to allow the \"clustering\" of stories, so that you see multiple posts of the same topic clustered together and the less popular ones hidden so that if you want to see more on the same topic, you expand the topic. This allows you to keep diversity of topics on the main page, and have multiple sources for in-depth coverage.\n\nThe other way is the Wikipedia current events way, where each breaking topic gets one big page with links to different sources embedded within the post. This will probably not work as well for Reddit, because one of the problems is that the discussions stop being easily navigable after reaching 1,000+, and the recent shooting news had posts with 40,000+ posts.\n\nIf reddit wants to remain useful as a news source, they're going to have to learn to hide stories on the same topic, with one main story per topic and a \"show more stories on this topic\" button, or maybe a \"would you like to know more?\" link."], [104, "Your /r/News mods are accused of censoring comments and news stories and trying to control the narrative.

Reddit cannot avoid doing so. But we've gone way beyond removing illegal content. Today rude, distasteful, or even simply unpopular comments are regularly purged. Popular opinions never needed protection. Free speech doesn't mean the freedom to agree or be silenced.\n\nMoreover, at Reddit's core is a mechanism which already manages undesirable content: the voting system. The entire idea behind the voting system is that users can democratically choose what comments and submissions they find value in, and consequently bury those they feel have no worth. Taking an active hand in removing distasteful content is tantamount to an admission that Reddit's moderators do not have any faith in democracy. And while the voting system is certainly vulnerable to manipulation, it seems that if Reddit had any faith in the values of free speech and democracy that it espoused, it would focus its efforts on combating manipulation rather than censorship.\n\nHow do you reconcile these acts of censorship with the company's stated goals of democratization and free speech?

Welcome to the Propaganda Machine\" (cross postfrom /r/Anticonsumption)\n\nBy /u/RainbowsAndDespair:\n\nMuch like the sidebar says, the Reddit that once existed is dead. I wanted to try and put together how this happened, and so I ended up writing a lengthy piece titled \u201cIs Reddit Dead? Welcome to the Propaganda Machine.\u201d If you don\u2019t want to read it, I\u2019ll highlight most of the points here. I'm interested in hearing what others have to say. Maybe some stuff I missed. Some stuff I got wrong. Etc..\n\n1) We sometimes forget how huge Reddit is. In 2015, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), ranking 14th most visited web-site in US and 36th in the world. With that kind of user base comes a huge amount of power and influence.\n\n2) The premise of Reddit has been hijacked. It\u2019s no longer the people creating the system, but what has become the system looking to create the people.\n\n3) It\u2019s an effective, concentrated model of what Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky discussed in \u201cManufacturing Consent\u201d, and the consequent stages of what Edward Bernays pioneered in the early 1900\u2019s and what was so aptly portrayed in Adam Curtis\u2019s BBC documentary \u201cThe Century of the Self\u201d: The formulation of the public consciousness is not so much of a direct endeavor but the tunneling of the citizen\u2019s possible thoughts toward a desired outcome. When the public gets there, the average citizen will think it\u2019s by their own independent and critical-thinking means.\n\n4) In fact, I was surprised at just how easily the current state of Reddit resembles the outline of Chomsky\u2019s five filters for editorial bias in the propaganda model.\n\n5) Much is being done to encourage simplicity in a difficult and complicated world and to discourage thinking outside the box. If you do think outside the box, it creates an environment where you feel alone and isolated in doing so. Most of the time, though, any \u201coutside thinking\u201d is illusory because you\u2019re being shuffled down that tunnel of thought and to your deathbed where you wish you wouldn\u2019t have spent so much time concerned about things in which you find out don\u2019t matter as much as they appeared.\n\n6) When the profit isn\u2019t enough, they will try to further control you. The profit is never enough.\n\n7) Anonymity isn\u2019t likely what you think it is: It has been rebranded. Your identity has been shifted. The name on your driver\u2019s license only matters when it comes to your ISP knowing who to send the bill to. On the internet, your real identity is your IP address, your browser fingerprint, and the accumulation of your data from what sites you visit clear down to the camera-specific and geolocation metadata embedded into those photos you took on vacation a few years ago and posted online.\n\n8) Shoes, beer, movies, presidents, and war \u2013 they\u2019re all being sold the same way.\n\n9) In 2008, Obama\u2019s campaign presence on Reddit was huge and wildly influential, and that\u2019s part of the reason he beat out the likes of some major well-known manufacturers for Advertising Age\u2019s marketer of the year. But consequently, now we have an ugly mess in 2016 from all parties trying to capture that influence, and the accessibility factor has apparently been lowered to the lowest common denominator.\n\n10) Mega-corporations are here, in Reddit\u2019s pockets, moreso all the time, but their attempts at inserting content can be laughably bad sometimes. What\u2019s been made clear, though, is that it doesn\u2019t matter as long as they get views. Now that news websites are also hosting native advertisement disguised as news articles, the line continues to blur between you and a reality the advertisers want you to believe.\n\n11) A new thing I\u2019ve noticed on AskReddit: What at first appear to be legitimate responses then insert specific brands into the text as a form of advertisement. Most of this stuff is apparent because of its disproportionate use.\n\n12) It\u2019s seldom about getting you to enjoy what you already have, but getting you to desire what you don\u2019t have: To fill your games library, or your bookshelf, or your closet. What you don\u2019t have is always better, faster, healthier, cleaner, purer, sleeker, sexier, smarter\u2026. You can solve all of your problems, if only you\u2019d open your wallet. You don\u2019t have any problems? The internet is very good at creating them. The internet of things very much wants you to become an identity of things, and they want your religion to be their specific brand.

Even in the smaller subreddits, the skepticism is already there. Maybe the future is to embrace it all. I find that sad, because so much is pushed to get us to not think or converse in-depth, but to get us to associate idea and solutions as overly simplified and/or product-based.

We all know it, we've all felt it. The world has gone digital.

There are cold winds from the north, and hot winds from the south converging on this very website.\n\nA storm is brewing on Reddit that nobody can predict.\n\nI understand moderators and admin must feel like it's an impossible situation to please everyone as culture goes crazy and opposing ideas crash together in thousands of controversial upvotes and flamewars.

This process helps direct and channel discussion to a consolidated thread and reduce clutter. \nHowever, when looking at rapidly developing issues which draw more public attention, a spike in traffic occurs. During this influx of posts related to a specific situation, bot and moderator pruning have a vastly different effect. Where channeling traffic towards one thread works against redditors. \nRedditors adressing new developments face an uphill battle to surpass the often thousands of pre-existing up votes in order for the most current information to gain acknowledgement by the majority of users. \nThis increases the amount of time it takes for a specific piece of information to surface. This defeats a major function of reddit as a current and up to date resource.\n\nTo avoid this phenomena, reddit must adapt in these abnormal circumstances.\n\nDuring traffic spikes to specific subreddits, extremely volatile activity within a post, or Redditor usage trends, reddit must exercise a 'crisis' protocol.\n1. Bot activity must be suspended.\n2. Moderators must let reposts occur as many issues have more than one popular viewpoint, more than one topic of discussion (i.e. police response, civilian response, personal response, and world response)\n3.

They dun goofed, and now y'all dun goofed with this post. Be admins. Let this site stay fluid. If everyone decides to unsub from /r/news in favor of an alternate subreddit, so be it.

Since you mention that there was no censorship outside of now-restored posts, I assume that means you agree with the removal of comments that have not been reinstated. I saved a couple from the megathread when practically everything was being deleted, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on why they break the rules of /r/news. Mods of /r/news are welcome to chime in too.\n\n1. First, the comment by /u/unrave that was reinstated: [\"Here is a mainstream British media news item about the incident. The gunman is a 29-year-old Omar Mateen, an American citizen whose parents are from Afghanistan.\"] (https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nql8f/orlando_nightclub_shooting_megathread/d462ak9) I'm happy that it was reinstated but I cannot fathom how it was removed in the first place.\n\n2. Second, a comment by /u/VitaleTegn that remains removed (you can visit his user page to read the comment for yourself): [\"Moderators of /r/news: This is highly inappropriate and morally detestable. At this point, you're just deleting comments that don't suit your world view. Your job is to allow discussion (especially on a breaking news story like this) and not pick and choose the comments you want to be seen. Go ahead, delete mine; you'll just be making my point stand true.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nql8f/orlando_nightclub_shooting_megathread/d463a7s) I don't think this breaks any of the rules; perhaps you could argue that it's \"unnecessarily rude or provocative\"?\n\n3.

Far too many subs have gone off the wire with rules and moderation to the point it affects my experience with Reddit.\n\nI know mods are volunteers  (as I mentioned I mod) but they still should be some checks and balances on their power and repercussions when they do poor work.  I also think Reddit as a company needs to structure subs in a way that don't require as much human judgement to help and shorten some of these crazy rule lists we have.  For example, a sub template for a TV show with spoiler tags prebuilt in, title templates built in a programmatic fashion, time controls similar to reddit live threads for premiere episode threads, etc.  This is just a single example for any number of sub reddit templates that could exist. \n\nYou guys should also work with moderators on moderating techniques and perhaps make a guide book to moderating.

Watched as admins actually working with mods that had bad raps (VA anyone?) to align them with a more inclusive way of moderating. Saw admins right in the thick of commenting and moderating in some big events (Norway shooting comes to mind). Now, you know when I see admin anywhere on Reddit? In times like this days after the userbase is calling foul. This isn't a public school board, situations happen in real time, why the delay to hear from head office? \n\n\nYou and the rest of the admins are the mods of mods, letting a situation get way out of hand, splintering subs and alienating users while your team watches the cards fall isn't necessary. You can't say that nobody on the admin team saw the censorship spree in Orlando threads, any one of them could have directed /r/news mods or calmed down the herd asking for heads to roll.

For a platform that once espoused an absolute belief in free speech, Reddit has taken an almost paradoxical turn towards carefully cultivating a political and social message by removing content that doesn't suit its vision.\n\nTo be clear: I am not talking about constitutionally protected freedom of speech. Obviously, Reddit is a private institution, and can censor content on its site as they see fit. Instead, I am referring to the philosophy of free speech which the founders of this website once considered to be a core value.\n\nCertainly, illegal content must be removed. Reddit cannot avoid doing so. But we've gone way beyond removing illegal content. Today rude, distasteful, or even simply unpopular comments are regularly purged. Popular opinions never needed protection. Free speech doesn't mean the freedom to agree or be silenced.\n\nMoreover, at Reddit's core is a mechanism which already manages undesirable content: the voting system. The entire idea behind the voting system is that users can democratically choose what comments and submissions they find value in, and consequently bury those they feel have no worth. Taking an active hand in removing distasteful content is tantamount to an admission that Reddit's moderators do not have any faith in democracy. And while the voting system is certainly vulnerable to manipulation, it seems that if Reddit had any faith in the values of free speech and democracy that it espoused, it would focus its efforts on combating manipulation rather than censorship.\n\nHow do you reconcile these acts of censorship with the company's stated goals of democratization and free speech? Why has the site drifted towards dictatorial control rather than user driven curation over time? Do you not see this event as a direct consequence of the shift towards a more hands-on approach to managing content?", "id": "d4800ia"}], [{"comment": "> Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established.

I'm not trying to call those rules good or bad, I'm just stating this is what seems to be the case.\n\nFurther, it feels like the community really has no input on how a subreddit should be run.  On a subreddit as big as r/news, or any of the defaults, there is no good mechanism to ensure the voice of the community is heard.  I think the best remedy should be allow the community to vote for moderators, at least on the default subreddits.

Welcome to the Propaganda Machine\" (cross postfrom /r/Anticonsumption)\n\nBy /u/RainbowsAndDespair:\n\nMuch like the sidebar says, the Reddit that once existed is dead. I wanted to try and put together how this happened, and so I ended up writing a lengthy piece titled \u201cIs Reddit Dead? Welcome to the Propaganda Machine.\u201d If you don\u2019t want to read it, I\u2019ll highlight most of the points here. I'm interested in hearing what others have to say. Maybe some stuff I missed. Some stuff I got wrong. Etc..\n\n1) We sometimes forget how huge Reddit is. In 2015, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), ranking 14th most visited web-site in US and 36th in the world. With that kind of user base comes a huge amount of power and influence.\n\n2) The premise of Reddit has been hijacked. It\u2019s no longer the people creating the system, but what has become the system looking to create the people.\n\n3) It\u2019s an effective, concentrated model of what Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky discussed in \u201cManufacturing Consent\u201d, and the consequent stages of what Edward Bernays pioneered in the early 1900\u2019s and what was so aptly portrayed in Adam Curtis\u2019s BBC documentary \u201cThe Century of the Self\u201d: The formulation of the public consciousness is not so much of a direct endeavor but the tunneling of the citizen\u2019s possible thoughts toward a desired outcome. When the public gets there, the average citizen will think it\u2019s by their own independent and critical-thinking means.\n\n4) In fact, I was surprised at just how easily the current state of Reddit resembles the outline of Chomsky\u2019s five filters for editorial bias in the propaganda model.\n\n5) Much is being done to encourage simplicity in a difficult and complicated world and to discourage thinking outside the box. If you do think outside the box, it creates an environment where you feel alone and isolated in doing so. Most of the time, though, any \u201coutside thinking\u201d is illusory because you\u2019re being shuffled down that tunnel of thought and to your deathbed where you wish you wouldn\u2019t have spent so much time concerned about things in which you find out don\u2019t matter as much as they appeared.\n\n6) When the profit isn\u2019t enough, they will try to further control you. The profit is never enough.\n\n7) Anonymity isn\u2019t likely what you think it is: It has been rebranded. Your identity has been shifted. The name on your driver\u2019s license only matters when it comes to your ISP knowing who to send the bill to. On the internet, your real identity is your IP address, your browser fingerprint, and the accumulation of your data from what sites you visit clear down to the camera-specific and geolocation metadata embedded into those photos you took on vacation a few years ago and posted online.\n\n8) Shoes, beer, movies, presidents, and war \u2013 they\u2019re all being sold the same way.\n\n9) In 2008, Obama\u2019s campaign presence on Reddit was huge and wildly influential, and that\u2019s part of the reason he beat out the likes of some major well-known manufacturers for Advertising Age\u2019s marketer of the year. But consequently, now we have an ugly mess in 2016 from all parties trying to capture that influence, and the accessibility factor has apparently been lowered to the lowest common denominator.\n\n10) Mega-corporations are here, in Reddit\u2019s pockets, moreso all the time, but their attempts at inserting content can be laughably bad sometimes. What\u2019s been made clear, though, is that it doesn\u2019t matter as long as they get views. Now that news websites are also hosting native advertisement disguised as news articles, the line continues to blur between you and a reality the advertisers want you to believe.\n\n11) A new thing I\u2019ve noticed on AskReddit: What at first appear to be legitimate responses then insert specific brands into the text as a form of advertisement. Most of this stuff is apparent because of its disproportionate use.\n\n12) It\u2019s seldom about getting you to enjoy what you already have, but getting you to desire what you don\u2019t have: To fill your games library, or your bookshelf, or your closet. What you don\u2019t have is always better, faster, healthier, cleaner, purer, sleeker, sexier, smarter\u2026. You can solve all of your problems, if only you\u2019d open your wallet. You don\u2019t have any problems? The internet is very good at creating them. The internet of things very much wants you to become an identity of things, and they want your religion to be their specific brand. The better you is always up ahead.\n\n13) The Reddit voting system is so skewed, the value of the individual voter is so lost, the voting system might as well be called fake. The organic, democratic, precedent set by the early days of Reddit turned out to be a training session for a corporate plaza atmosphere, and now people are left pushing placebo buttons similarly to how pedestrians push placebo crosswalk buttons in busy cities.\n\n14) In \u201cThe Century of the Self\u201d, we are taught that the main goal is to get consumers to make irrational and emotion-based decisions, even if those decisions are at odds with what they value.\n\n15) The internet was once a place different than the place it is today, but now the books have been written on how to manipulate the online masses, and what is apparent is that the internet isn\u2019t only the greatest communication tool the world has ever known, but the most effective propaganda tool the world has ever known \u2013 and that\u2019s not a hyperbolic statement.\n\n16) It\u2019s much more than a \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it then leave argument.\u201d Not everyone has the time or the capacity to understand what is going on in this new age of propaganda on the internet, but these are also the people who will be swept along and will ultimately have an impact on the more knowledgeable person, whether with that knowledge he or she quits any individual service or not.\n\n17) The trust is gone for me. Even in the smaller subreddits, the skepticism is already there. Maybe the future is to embrace it all. I find that sad, because so much is pushed to get us to not think or converse in-depth, but to get us to associate idea and solutions as overly simplified and/or product-based. In the end, it\u2019s a hollow sense of fulfillment.\n\nFull article here: https://thetechnologicbrain.wordpress.com/2016/06/10/is-reddit-dead-welcome-to-the-propaganda-machine/\n\n---", "id": "d48mb3r"}], [{"comment": ">Whether you agree with r/news\u2019 policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators.

This process helps direct and channel discussion to a consolidated thread and reduce clutter. \nHowever, when looking at rapidly developing issues which draw more public attention, a spike in traffic occurs. During this influx of posts related to a specific situation, bot and moderator pruning have a vastly different effect. Where channeling traffic towards one thread works against redditors. \nRedditors adressing new developments face an uphill battle to surpass the often thousands of pre-existing up votes in order for the most current information to gain acknowledgement by the majority of users. \nThis increases the amount of time it takes for a specific piece of information to surface. This defeats a major function of reddit as a current and up to date resource.\n\nTo avoid this phenomena, reddit must adapt in these abnormal circumstances.\n\nDuring traffic spikes to specific subreddits, extremely volatile activity within a post, or Redditor usage trends, reddit must exercise a 'crisis' protocol.\n1. Bot activity must be suspended.\n2. Moderators must let reposts occur as many issues have more than one popular viewpoint, more than one topic of discussion (i.e. police response, civilian response, personal response, and world response)\n3. Most important of all, reddit should have designated employees, who at any given time are to respond to these rapidly growing issues and take over control of the sub reddit in question.(This is not an unreasonable thing to put in place) This way, Rouge Moderators, and trigger happy bots deleting 'unnessary posts' are a thing of the past. \nAnd as a company, Reddit can take control and responsibility for ensuring it's own validity as a source of relevant news. \n\nAs admitted in the original post, (albeit subtly) Reddit did determine that censorship took place. Their only course of action was to ammend what took place, and undo the posts which were affected. At this point that is all Reddit as an organization can offer. As a community Redditors need to demand better administrative functioning. \n\nAdministrators of Reddit, instead of dealing with the fallout of failures of others within our community, take the reigns and control where and how your community functions. \n\nHave designated staff whom are competent take over a subreddit, as subreddit activity spikes beyond normal bounds. \n\nWhile this may seem too totalitarian, forceful, or disrespectful to the Moderators who normally maintain and work to make these subreddits and make them better. It functions much like US government, with the role of 'commander in chief'.

If you're an active Reddit user, your viglink cookies could easily grow to a few ~~megabytes~~ kilobytes.

Data not being stored on viglink servers means that it's being stored on the client as cookies. One oft-overlooked aspect of cookies is that they're sent with every request. Tracking cookies, in particular, are prone to \"bloat\", where the client sends a cookie that the server reads and appends to, then sends back.\n\nNow think about this for a minute. You're on Reddit clicking links, and every e-commerce item you view is getting passed back and forth from your browser to Viglink *and back*. If you're an active Reddit user, your viglink cookies could easily grow to a few ~~megabytes~~ kilobytes. For no benefit to the user, they experience slower link load times due to larger request response times.\n\nThe situation for mobile users who pay for data is even worse: chances are, you're getting charged for that cookie data every time you send and receive it!\n\nI would argue that a core competency of Reddit used to be to provide a variety of linked content. Doesn't it seem strange, then, to implement an affiliate framework that penalizes the user the more active they are on Reddit?\n\nFurthermore, when I see product recommendations on Reddit, it usually comes from someone who has genuinely enjoyed a product and wants to get the word out about it.
