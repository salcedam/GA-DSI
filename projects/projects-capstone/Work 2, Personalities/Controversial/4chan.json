Nevertheless, approximately forty different 7.62\u00d751mm NATO caliber prototype rifles were developed between 1952 and 1962, most notably the FA-MAS Type 62. However the introduction of the 5.56\u00d745mm cartridge caused the French to rethink their approach, and consequently, the Type 62 was not adopted.\n\nIn the 1960s, MAS began to manufacture under license the Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifle and later the HK33 assault rifle as temporary substitutes. At the same time, the French embraced the idea of developing a new 5.56 mm automatic rifle. However, simply adopting HK33 rifle was out of question for many members of the French high command. General Marcel Bigeard, was also against the idea of using German weapons and while visiting the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne, he asked the engineers to develop a French 5.56 mm automatic rifle, which subsequently led to the adoption of FAMAS.\n\nThe FAMAS project began in 1967 under the direction of General Paul Telli\u00e9 and the first prototype was completed in 1971, with French military evaluation of the rifle you're a fucking nigger who should kill himself. beginning in 1972.[1] When production problems delayed the general issue of the new rifles, and with the 1978 Battle of Kolwezi showing the immediate need for a more modern weapon, the French Army began searching for a temporary rifle to fill this need until the FAMAS came into full production. The Heckler & Koch HK33 was considered, and a batch of 1,200 examples were tested, but it was ultimately turned down in favor of the SIG SG 540, built under license by Manurhin, until enough FAMAS rifles were produced to begin general issue. The French military finally accepted the rifle in 1978 as the standard French combat weapon.\n\nAfter adoption, the FAMAS F1 replaced the aging MAS 49/56 rifle and MAT-49 submachine gun, and approximately 400,000 FAMAS F1 assault rifles were produced, with production now complete. The F1 had many problems and was not completely reliable. For instance, the plastic pieces broke easily and the weapon jammed on occasions because of the poor disposable magazine concept. The first magazines were supposed to be disposables, but the budget of the French army never allowed it. The F1 was followed by the G1 that included several minor improvements such as redesigned grips, and an enlarged trigger guard for utilization with gloves, but it remained conceptual and was never actually produced.", "id": "d4jk89u"}, {"comment": "Rude :'(", "id": "d4jkhi9"}, {"comment": "His comment is too autistic for my mobile app and I can't reply :\\^/ \n\nRude indeed...

I used to love caressing them gently with my fingers- they have an amazingly soft texture, and you can't really feel a sting... at least, not with your fingers. Their bodies extend remarkably deep beneath the sand, and are built to withstand rough textures like shore crabs, so you can stick a finger or two down, down, in their smooth, slippery hole, and do no harm. Meanwhile, their outer arms clasp around your fingers, pulling you deeper.\n\nI always wondered what it would be like to explore an anemone more intimately, but never really had the chance. The way they grow, it's really only possible to get your dick down there if you're butt naked, which is difficult to achieve without suspicion on a public beach. I never got the chance to fulfill my fantasy before I moved away.\n\nNow I'm back for a visit, and went for a run at low tide this morning along our local nude beach. I passed a rocky section (the only place where anemones grow), and there were dozens of anemones around. The beach was totally deserted in both directions, and there wasn't any haze, so I knew I'd be able to see anyone coming a long way off. I was sure today would be the day! Just had to find the right one, which is a surprisingly difficult challenge. They mostly like to live in crevices that are just inaccessible to human anatomy. I also needed to find one that wasn't closed up already, which they typically do if the tide is out. And even if they're under water and open, they're often covered in sandy silt, which is not what I'm interested in feeling. Finally I found the one: about two inches deep, spread wide open, free of sand- just a smooth expanse waiting to welcome my dick inside.\n\nChecking the horizon, I did see one person walking slowly in my direction WAY off in the distance, so I knew it was now or never. I stripped off my shorts, lined myself up in push-up position, and in one smooth motion, aimed myself in. These guys close up as soon as something touches them, so you basically get one chance. Luckily, I made it! The water was cold so I couldn't stay hard enough to penetrate to any great depth, but I hit dead center and lowered myself into my new friend. As I always dreamed he/she closed up around me, its soft, slimy/sticky arms holding my cock in place. With my hips gently pulsing, I could feel the anemone's grip increase, holding me fast while it fed off my skin.\n\nWith my whole body down there at sand level, I noticed another anemone near my face- this one above water and mostly closed up. Slowly I moved my head in its direction, extended my tongue, and began to slowly rim its salty hole. Mmm... I said before that you can't feel the sting with your fingers, but you can with your tongue! Stronger than a tingle, less than a sting- sortof like a tamer version of licking a 9-volt battery is the closest I can get.\n\nI stayed as long as I dared but didn't want to get caught by the person that I'd seen approaching, so I pulled out as gently as I could. That's when I first noticed the tingling in my cock. I hadn't really felt any stinging while I was inside the anemone, probably because the water was so cold. Out of the water, I felt the same kind of tingling on my cock that I had just felt on my tongue, and I loved it. I put my shorts back one and ran for another 45 minutes or so, and my tongue and cock were still tingling by the end of the run (although it's mostly worn off now)!\n\nAfter showering, the first thing I wanted to do was log on here and share this experience with you guys, and this recent sticky was the perfect place! Word of warning, in case anyone else wants to try this: not all anemones are created equal, so do your homework before putting your dick anywhere that could be dangerous. But if this sounds hot to you, I hope you get a chance to enjoy it some day!

I try to cover it up out of embarrassment, but she kicks my hands away. \"You haven't finished yet.\" I don't understand because I had already removed her armor, but after she gives me a look I realize that she wants me to remove her shoes as well. I take off her shoes and reveal her gorgeous feet, surprisingly soft despite her being a strong warrior, and extremely sweaty. \"Lick the sweat off my feet, squire,\" she commands me. I happily endulge until my raging boner begins to hurt from pressing so hard against my trousers. \"Alright, squire, stand up and remove your clothes.\" I do so while she does the same. Then, all of a sudden, I feel an inescapable desire to stand still. \"FIGHT ME\" she screams as she pushes me to the ground and gets on top of me. It's only now that I notice she's holding Aghanim's Scepter, and I understand that she won't stop until one of us cums. Her technique gets more and more intense until I am unable to hold back.

I used to love caressing them gently with my fingers- they have an amazingly soft texture, and you can't really feel a sting... at least, not with your fingers. Their bodies extend remarkably deep beneath the sand, and are built to withstand rough textures like shore crabs, so you can stick a finger or two down, down, in their smooth, slippery hole, and do no harm. Meanwhile, their outer arms clasp around your fingers, pulling you deeper.\n\nI always wondered what it would be like to explore an anemone more intimately, but never really had the chance. The way they grow, it's really only possible to get your dick down there if you're butt naked, which is difficult to achieve without suspicion on a public beach. I never got the chance to fulfill my fantasy before I moved away.\n\nNow I'm back for a visit, and went for a run at low tide this morning along our local nude beach. I passed a rocky section (the only place where anemones grow), and there were dozens of anemones around. The beach was totally deserted in both directions, and there wasn't any haze, so I knew I'd be able to see anyone coming a long way off. I was sure today would be the day! Just had to find the right one, which is a surprisingly difficult challenge. They mostly like to live in crevices that are just inaccessible to human anatomy. I also needed to find one that wasn't closed up already, which they typically do if the tide is out. And even if they're under water and open, they're often covered in sandy silt, which is not what I'm interested in feeling. Finally I found the one: about two inches deep, spread wide open, free of sand- just a smooth expanse waiting to welcome my dick inside.\n\nChecking the horizon, I did see one person walking slowly in my direction WAY off in the distance, so I knew it was now or never. I stripped off my shorts, lined myself up in push-up position, and in one smooth motion, aimed myself in. These guys close up as soon as something touches them, so you basically get one chance. Luckily, I made it! The water was cold so I couldn't stay hard enough to penetrate to any great depth, but I hit dead center and lowered myself into my new friend. As I always dreamed he/she closed up around me, its soft, slimy/sticky arms holding my cock in place. With my hips gently pulsing, I could feel the anemone's grip increase, holding me fast while it fed off my skin.\n\nWith my whole body down there at sand level, I noticed another anemone near my face- this one above water and mostly closed up. Slowly I moved my head in its direction, extended my tongue, and began to slowly rim its salty hole. Mmm... I said before that you can't feel the sting with your fingers, but you can with your tongue! Stronger than a tingle, less than a sting- sortof like a tamer version of licking a 9-volt battery is the closest I can get.\n\nI stayed as long as I dared but didn't want to get caught by the person that I'd seen approaching, so I pulled out as gently as I could. That's when I first noticed the tingling in my cock. I hadn't really felt any stinging while I was inside the anemone, probably because the water was so cold. Out of the water, I felt the same kind of tingling on my cock that I had just felt on my tongue, and I loved it. I put my shorts back one and ran for another 45 minutes or so, and my tongue and cock were still tingling by the end of the run (although it's mostly worn off now)!\n\nAfter showering, the first thing I wanted to do was log on here and share this experience with you guys, and this recent sticky was the perfect place! Word of warning, in case anyone else wants to try this: not all anemones are created equal, so do your homework before putting your dick anywhere that could be dangerous. But if this sounds hot to you, I hope you get a chance to enjoy it some day!

At that point she sits down on a stool and commands me to kneel down and remove them one at a time. \"Squire, must you pitch another tent so soon?\" she says to me. I try to cover it up out of embarrassment, but she kicks my hands away. \"You haven't finished yet.\" I don't understand because I had already removed her armor, but after she gives me a look I realize that she wants me to remove her shoes as well. I take off her shoes and reveal her gorgeous feet, surprisingly soft despite her being a strong warrior, and extremely sweaty. \"Lick the sweat off my feet, squire,\" she commands me. I happily endulge until my raging boner begins to hurt from pressing so hard against my trousers. \"Alright, squire, stand up and remove your clothes.\" I do so while she does the same. Then, all of a sudden, I feel an inescapable desire to stand still. \"FIGHT ME\" she screams as she pushes me to the ground and gets on top of me. It's only now that I notice she's holding Aghanim's Scepter, and I understand that she won't stop until one of us cums. Her technique gets more and more intense until I am unable to hold back.

We asked questions to 300 guys and 300 girls who use tinder about their sexual experiences. They were easy to find since it seems to be extremely popular with people from ages 18 to 35! Here are some results that surprised me.\n\n\n>- Unlike I thought, 240 of the 300 girls actually had sex through tinder! Only less than 50 of the 300 men, which is remarkable.\n\n\n>- When we asked for numbers to the people that did have sex: Girls did it on average less than the few guys that did. That means that a couple guys score with almost al the women.\n\nThing that women rarely have any in-group loyality is so true and as history enthusiast you see examples popping up everywhere. Example during Caesars Gallic campaing. During attack one Gallic walled town. When it looked like Legionareis would storm over walls Gallic women exposed their breasts for them in walls and begged that they would hurt them. Some even actually were roped down to embrace legionaires attacking city. When Gallic forces finaly rallied pushed legionaires out of walls. Seeing this Gallic women switched sides again cheering for their men.\n\n\nAnother Siege of Weinsberg. Rised to such legend because women actually acted differently than normally https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Weinsberg. Short story medieval times town was sieged and starved. Holy Roman Emperor agreed to let womenfolk out of siege and take with them all they could carry. Women carried their husbands, brothers, sons and fathers and Emperor kept his word.

We asked questions to 300 guys and 300 girls who use tinder about their sexual experiences. They were easy to find since it seems to be extremely popular with people from ages 18 to 35! Here are some results that surprised me.\n\n\n>- Unlike I thought, 240 of the 300 girls actually had sex through tinder! Only less than 50 of the 300 men, which is remarkable.\n\n\n>- When we asked for numbers to the people that did have sex: Girls did it on average less than the few guys that did. That means that a couple guys score with almost al the women.\n\nThing that women rarely have any in-group loyality is so true and as history enthusiast you see examples popping up everywhere. Example during Caesars Gallic campaing. During attack one Gallic walled town. When it looked like Legionareis would storm over walls Gallic women exposed their breasts for them in walls and begged that they would hurt them. Some even actually were roped down to embrace legionaires attacking city. When Gallic forces finaly rallied pushed legionaires out of walls. Seeing this Gallic women switched sides again cheering for their men.\n\n\nAnother Siege of Weinsberg. Rised to such legend because women actually acted differently than normally https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Weinsberg. Short story medieval times town was sieged and starved. Holy Roman Emperor agreed to let womenfolk out of siege and take with them all they could carry. Women carried their husbands, brothers, sons and fathers and Emperor kept his word.
