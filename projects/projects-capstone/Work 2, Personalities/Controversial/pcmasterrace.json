The gaming community is whiny as fuck and has such a sense of entitlement. Although games aren't exclusively for kids I still assume that a good portion of the audience is younger and doesn't have money which is exactly why they act like children about shit like this.    \n\nThere's some things about DLC that I like and don't like. Saying a developer who gives it away for free is \"doing it right\" is just bullshit. Personally if they tried to sell these skins in the OP I'd just say fuck off and not get them anyway nor would I be upset. I don't feel that in adds anything to the game regardless. If you don't want to pay for it who cares, you're not really losing anything by not having it. It's like gamers buy a meal, enjoy it, then get upset and feel they are being robbed because they are told they have to buy dessert. If you never offered a paid dessert they wouldn't even care because they'd never know what they didn't have but once you show it to them they get upset because they feel they are missing something.    \n\nI remember the days when you bought a game, that was it. There was no more content to be had other than what's on the cartridge. You just play the game again or maybe wait for a sequel to come out if you were lucky. DLC is an amazing benefit to gaming. Now games you love to play can be expanded and adjusted and keep themselves fresh for a several months after the game is released and people are bitching that they have to pay for it. It's pretty sad.   \n\nThe downside to DLC is that you just know certain content is being withheld to sell as DLC. That's just annoying. Also with the ability to patch games studios are releasing buggy pieces of shit. Old school games had to work without issue prior to launch lest the studio planned to do a recall. So there are some legit concerns.   \n\nBut yeah, fuck the gaming community. Just whiny assholes. Nintendo games used to cost as much as $50, that doesn't even include inflation.

It's largely whatever sale you can find in your price bracket. But going forward AMD isn't going to hit the upper price segment of the market with Polaris, the're waiting more towards Vega. So Nvidia will likely keep the lead in the highest bracket like they have now with the 980Ti and the Titan come time for Pascal. However, with improved mid-level and mainstream (i.e. everything *below* the 970 and 980/1070 and 1080, AMD will likely be the front runner. *Especially* with their current advantage with DX12, technologies like Vulkan coming out, etc. Hell, in this gen with DX12, Vulkan, Mantle, etc. on the horizon it looks like the current AMD cards are going to age better and outperform Maxwell, meaning that the current gen could still be a viable sales option for higher end usage to some extent.

If the larger section of the market is dominated by AMD, then that's a win from a business standpoint.

I'm saying Nvidia has a popularity advantage since last gen and they're capitalizing on it to get their cards out early this gen.

The money in the GPU market is pennies compared to the CPU market, and Zen is slated to do very well in terms of recapturing market share in a market where a few percent can translate into billions. They don't have to beat Intel, just capture enough market share. Intel is massive and has always been bigger than AMD, so a 10% market share capture will hurt.\n\nA larger CPU market means a **lot** of money or them to put into development. Also, note how consoles are all AMD APUs, meaning AMD can leverage in influence the gaming industry by directly effecting what developer have to work with, both on CPU and the GPU side. Previously gaming heavily favored Intel, however AMD developed a new API to combat the issues. In the new Hitman the old FX8370 has gotten very close to closing the gap on the i7 6700k. A new architecture fixing a lot of their CPU mistakes and the new APIs coming out means AMD is poised to make huge leaps. Even if Zen can't compete with Skylake outside gaming, they're close enough to the point it won't make a huge difference to most users. Selling at a lower price point will also entice manufaturers to include AMD off the shelf, which they really didn't because of Intel's anti-competitive practices followed by AMD's poor architecture choices like Bulldozer. They will likely take a big chuck of the gaming market in both CPU and GPU performance. \n\nAlso, remember how Quantum Break was way better on AMD hardware? Expect more things like that to happen. Ports are easy if the original functions on your architecture. Want to push devs to greater embrace SLI which will work so much better with DX12 and Vulkan (which is great for cross platform and multiple OS developing btw), both of which seem to favor AMD so far? Then force them to develop on SLI setups by putting two chips in consoles, i.e. using your deal with manufacturers and assuring them that their devs have always done great optimization and this will be no different (also, it's likely to be lower hardware cost to have two smaller/weaker chips per card). Nvidia is also basically out of the console market and offers no real reason to be the baseline for development. AMD's market share for gaming across the industry is utterly massive if you look outside PC gaming. They're in the XBox One, the PS4, and they'll be in the next gen of all three big consoles. AMD hardware running APIs developed and optimized for AMD is going to be a huge upset. \n\nDevelopers want their games to be able to run on weaker hardware (i.e. cheaper hardware) since it means they have a larger sales potential. An what is AMD doing? Their new generation of GPUs is focusing on the lower/mid range (i.e. the most popular price points) and their CPUs are closing the gap in utility across all markets. Come time to let out the big dogs with Vega, they'll have some well developed GPU muscles to use in the new DX12/Vulkan/etc. playing field. They know exactly what they're doing.

Same as the 970 VRAM issue.\n\nUnfortunately, as much as Jay, Ryan, and Logan like to believe that they are neutral and unbiased, it couldn't be further from the truth. They constantly made snide remarks about AMD all the time in casual conversation on their podcasts, and go out of their way to not say anything objectively negative about NVidia. Why? Because they all LOVE to get free shit, and play the game with the NVidia PR department to ensure they continue to do so.\n\nSo as soon as the throttling thing became a topic, NVidia contacted their 'influencers' (not 'reviewers', because that would mean they were real journalists, NVidia considers them nothing but PR extensions for pushing people towards a new product), and had them make a new video showing that it wasn't a big deal. Jay has done that video, while most have remained silent. Not unlike the 3.5VRAM issue were a couple of the brown noser's said it wasn't an issue, and had \"proof\" that it wasn't. Then Nvidias official statement came out, and all of the rest of the 'influencers' suddenly had articles out claiming it was never as bad as everyone claimed, and their NEW tests showed no issues at all. Despite the fact that the new tests were done with cooked drivers that had work arounds for that 512mb of worthless VRAM.\n\nGiven that, I would expect that NVidia will release a massive PR package in this coming week about the thermal throttling, and after that hits, we will see all the usual suspects...

I use both systems, and I really appreciate the power of Linux, but it takes a lot of effort and a rather steep learning curve to know how to unlock this power.

The EVGA NEX650G is the reason I got my current build, as it is the reason my former rig lies buried in the depth of short circuited components on some dumpsite. It popped after 4 months and took my Phenom II and my HD 7970 with it.

So my choice here was a Corsair RMi, a Tier 1 PSU, to never have to experience the loss of the whole system due to popping and not enough security measures to prevent a short circuit being send through the whole system.\n\n2. My Skylake build was set up at the time the Skylake was unavailable to purchase, as was the 6600K, and I stumbled upon an offer on a site affiliated with eBay here in germany that let me buy it for 280\u20ac at a time where the only available units in online stores where arround 400\u20ac and therefore set the base for my rig. It gets used to its potential in CAD, so the i7 has it's place in my build, but for a pure gaming rig the i5 is a more reasonable choice.\n\n3. The person who sold me my Corsair RAM on the same eBay affiliated site offered me a MSI R9 390X for just 270\u20ac, an offer I couldn't refuse, yet I would never suggest buying it at fullprice over the 390 for the 3-5% max. performance boost it offers in just some cases.\n\n4. So overall my build cost me arround 900\u20ac incl. shipping and OS, which for it's performance is unbeatable and before you ask, yes it is overclocked and watercooled (just switched the CPU cooler on my old loop and am now waiting for availability of EKWBs MSI 390 Waterblock.\n\n5.

My Skylake build was set up at the time the Skylake was unavailable to purchase, as was the 6600K, and I stumbled upon an offer on a site affiliated with eBay here in germany that let me buy it for 280\u20ac at a time where the only available units in online stores where arround 400\u20ac and therefore set the base for my rig. It gets used to its potential in CAD, so the i7 has it's place in my build, but for a pure gaming rig the i5 is a more reasonable choice.\n\n3. The person who sold me my Corsair RAM on the same eBay affiliated site offered me a MSI R9 390X for just 270\u20ac, an offer I couldn't refuse, yet I would never suggest buying it at fullprice over the 390 for the 3-5% max. performance boost it offers in just some cases.\n\n4. So overall my build cost me arround 900\u20ac incl. shipping and OS, which for it's performance is unbeatable and before you ask, yes it is overclocked and watercooled (just switched the CPU cooler on my old loop and am now waiting for availability of EKWBs MSI 390 Waterblock.\n\n5. I barely give advice on Motherboards or GPUs, as it in many cases comes down to personal preference, overall aesthetics and maybe going with a desired color scheme. Due to good experience with Asrock and some luck I found the Z170 Deluxe 4+ in the outlet of alternate.de for 40\u20ac less than new, selling for 119\u20ac at the time, which made it my Motherboard of choice and it's clean and monoton look really pleases my eyes.\n\nDespite all the comments that came in during my typing, I somewhat felt the necessity to submit it anyways, just to get it ouf of my head.

I wrote a long comment about this on a similar thread a while back, I'll just copy and paste that:\n\nOk, I really want to weigh in here, because the entire concept of 'IPC' is a ***huge*** oversimplification - the kind of thing that's mentioned in high-level tech articles, stuff aimed at investors, and the anandtech forums.  Ultimately saying \"Intel CPUs have more IPC\" or \"The next generation has 10% more IPC than the last\" is just another way of saying \"Intel CPUs have higher benchmark scores\" or \"The next generation has 10% higher benchmark scores than the last\".  At best all you're doing is dividing benchmark score by GHz.\n\nFull disclosure: I am an AMD user - always have been because of value, the long life of AMD sockets, and ethical issues (I'll get into that later).\n\nSo, most people imagine that a CPU core takes a list of instuctions one after the other and executes one every clock cycle.  This is why the 'megahertz myth' exists, because in this scenario performance would depend entirely on clock speed.  But in reality CPUs are much more complicated than this.  There are three things that affect performance:\n\n**1) Availability of data**\n\nFor a CPU to perform an operation, the data it's using needs to be available.  This can't happen in 1 cycle - it takes a very long time to fetch data (memory is relatively slow and very high latency).  For this reason, every modern CPU has to guess what data will be needed and make it readily available by moving it to a cache - the L1 cache being the fastest by a long way.  If the data needed isn't immediately available the CPU has to wait for it, wasting cycles - this is called a stall.  A similar principle applies to instructions, as code may have many different paths it can take (you might be thinking \"why not make the L1 cache really big to hold all possibilities?\", but doing that would also mean it was slower to access).\n\nHow good a CPU is at predicting what data and instructions it will need affects how many cycles are wasted.\n\n**2) Instruction set extensions**\n\nThis is a really important one - the x86_64 instruction set AMD and Intel use is being extended all the time.  New instructions define more complicated operations, so things that used to be several instructions are now just one and as such can be executed in a single cycle rather than many (I'm simplifying a little but that's the gist).  This is a great way performance can be improved, and good compilers take advantage of this to produce code that can run much faster.\n\nUnfortunately AMD are always behind Intel on new instructions, and that's not their fault.  You see, Intel control the x86 instruction set, with 230 of the 256 possible instruction codes assigned to them.  And they don't play nice.  AMD pretty much have to wait until intel anmnounces new instructions before working on supporting them, at which point Intel are usually on the brink of bringing a CPU with them to market - and developing a CPU takes *years* so this puts AMD (and VIA, the other x86 vendor, but via don't do high-performance stuff) way behind.  This is my first ethical reason for preferring AMD.  Further reading: http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=25\n\nRelated to this is the issue of whether these instuctions are even used.  Intel provide a compiler that has been used very widely, and [it cheats](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/07/atom-nano-review/6/).  The code it generates checks what CPU it's running on to see what instruction set extensions it supports in order to run code that takes advantage of them - good - but then if it detects a non-intel CPU throws all that out and choses the least efficient code!!! - ***bad***.  Some benchmarks have used Intel's compiler in the past and these shenanigans have in the past made AMD look bad - there's concern it could still be going on, but nothing definite recently.  Further reading: http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=49\n\n**3) Instruction-level Parallelism**\n\nThis is the single thing that makes the biggest difference - modern cores can execute *more than one instruction per cycle*.  You see, most code has bits where you have several instructions that aren't dependent on each other - for example, if you're adding together a, b, c and d you can do a+b and c+d at the same time, then add the result.  Intel CPUs can, where the code allows, execute many more instructions at the same time than AMD CPUs, and they're probably better at working out when the code does allow it as well.\n\nThis is why when the FX-8150 came out it could beat the i7-2600k in linux kernel compilation with GCC and in video transcoding with handbrake (which by the way is floating-point-heavy!), but was measurably slower in CPU bound singlethreaded games - handbrake and GCC used lots of threads and therefore the full 8 cores but not much ILP, games tend to use few threads but lots of ILP.  It's also why people have high hopes for Zen, because if you compare the detailed diagrams of [bulldozer](http://www.planet3dnow.de/photoplog/file.php?n=10743&w=l) and [zen](http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AMD-Zen-Block-Diagram.jpg) you can see zen is capable of more simultaneous instructions.\n\nI've still left a fair bit of stuff out, because CPU design is bloody complicated (and because I'm avoiding the more in-depth stuff that I know I don't know), but those are the three big *reasons* why *measurements* like ILP differ between CPUs, and in particular why AMD's processes are generally slower than intel's despite higher GHz and more cores."], [7, "Please, my 8350 performs very well.

It's also why people have high hopes for Zen, because if you compare the detailed diagrams of [bulldozer](http://www.planet3dnow.de/photoplog/file.php?n=10743&w=l) and [zen](http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AMD-Zen-Block-Diagram.jpg) you can see zen is capable of more simultaneous instructions.\n\nI've still left a fair bit of stuff out, because CPU design is bloody complicated (and because I'm avoiding the more in-depth stuff that I know I don't know), but those are the three big *reasons* why *measurements* like ILP differ between CPUs, and in particular why AMD's processes are generally slower than intel's despite higher GHz and more cores.", "id": "d29bf5l"}, {"comment": "Even with all this:\n\nDoesn't change the fact that they are a pile of shit that a Core 2 Extreme beats clock-per-clock.", "id": "d29gz69"}, {"comment": "You said that an amd fx 8350 would be beat by an i3 6100.\n\nYou are full of shit.\nHere is a video of an fx 8300 ($120) kicking the shit out of an i3 6100 ($125) with both running at the exact same clock speed. \n\nhttp://youtu.be/nLkaNWo0EV0\n\nThe benchmarks you showed are either biased or outdated as multithreaded performance had improved massively over time.\n\nThe only game where the i3 comes out on top is rise of the tomb raider, but only in directX 11, and COD: Black ops 3, which the guy decides to remove from his benchmark list because of how outdated it is in terms of leveraging performance across multiple cores.\n\nFor fucks sake, Cities: skylines, which is massively CPU dependent, runs much better on the fx 8300.\n\nWhile the IPC of the i3 6100 is much higher than that of any of AMDs offerings, with how many games have been taking advantage of multiple cores, the FX 8300 clearly will offer better performance in today's games and the games of the future.

It's not the switches, the board quality, the printing-per-keycap, the ability to customize it with custom keycap sets or whatever /r/MK jerks off with. It's the software. And Corsair's is pretty damn good.\n\nAs a lefty, WASD is a no for me. It's uncomfortable, I use my mouse with my left hand and the keyboard with the right one, so the easiest solution for me is to use the arrows/numpad. Now, the thing with games is, when you rebind the numbers to numpad numbers, many of them won't allow it or they'll show annoyingly long names in your screen. Examples:\n\n> Press KP_END for your primary weapon, KP_DOWNARROW for your secondary and KP_PGDN for explosives\n\n> Press KP_LEFTARROW to throw a grenade!\n\n> Press KP_RIGHTARROW to equip your shield\n\nWith the software, I can easily remap the numbers in the keypad so they behave like \"normal\" numbers, giving me a more comfortable gaming experience. Likewise, if I ever happen to play an abhorrent port with no arrows support, I can use the software to easily rebind the arrows to WASD. As you might've guessed already, the numpad is also a big selling point for me, so no TKL/60% keyboards for me either.\n\nSo yeah, as much as I'd like to get a pretty, minimalistic mech like the POK3R, I choose functionality over looks, and that's why I'm thankful gaming keyboards exist. Many of them are gimmicky, yes, but the high end ones have features that make my gaming a lot more comfortable."], [5, ">Now corsair actually makes some pretty good boards. **I don\u2019t know about their software or if there is even any.**\n\nWait, did you go into this without all the information? What? First of all, Corsair's software is literally the best out there atm, and second of all, it does exist. You could have found this out [*with a simple google search.*](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=corsair+keyboard+software)\n\n>I haven\u2019t actually tried one of their boards\n\nHoly fuck. Then how the hell are you going to be able to properly review or 'debunk' them?\n\n>Corsair isn\u2019t all that bad. A bit pricey but honestly it\u2019s a decent product.\n\nCompared to...what? You can't just shoot pricey in there without a comparison each time.\n\n>They use cherry switches which are good and it has a good construction. Its main issue is the non-standard bottom row. Which prevents you from getting any aftermarket caps which is just kind of a bummer because that is one of the coolest parts of this hobby.\n\nHere are some actually legitimate pros and cons.\n\n>They have their own switches, cool not all that great but I mean not the worst switches out there either.\n\n[Omron, the makers of the Romer-G switch, is a well-known, well-established industrial manufacturer of switches.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omron#Business_divisions_and_products) While I do agree that Cherry is the undisputed king of keyboard switches, Cherry doesn't do much else, and Omron has experience in other fields, and is especially experienced in making shit last. They're definitely good enough to give Cherry a run for their money, and most *legitimate* reviewers agree.\n\n>Their boards are just kind of weird looking\n\nThis is literally an opinion. If you wanted to comment on it, you should have talked about them looking ***unique***, not weird. Because they are far from weird or out-of-place, as their aesthetic fits into many places, it's just less generic than it's competition. Which is neither bad nor good.\n\n>I don\u2019t think I ever will given the price point of $180. I could get some really nice keycaps or a really nice keyboard for that.\n\nAnd this keyboard is fairly nice, with quite unique, if not nice, keycaps. It's also important to note that the G910 also has some of the best key lighting on the market right now. Among all keyboards.\n\n>weird switches that aren\u2019t that special\n\nWhoa. You hold your shit right there. I've already explained why Omron isn't just some no-name weird switch-maker, unlike Khalil, but Omron's switches are definitely special. I'm not saying their better, that'd be stupid. They definitely take a different approach than Cherry however, having a unique feel, and different forms of damage-prevention. They also have redundancy in they switches, which is definitely special, though, as implied, redundant.\n\n>it\u2019s just kind of a mediocre board\n\nNo it's not. The plastic on it is of sufficient quality, and it's no better nor worse than the competition. The only major difference is that it uses plastic, but you'll be hard-pressed to break the plastic in normal use before the functionality of the keys first.\n\n>honestly for $180 you can do a lot better.\n\nAgain, you need comparisons. You can't just say, there are some Filco keyboards that are better and then expect people to just believe you. I went and looked at Filco keyboards, and there wasn't one, not a single one, that had full RGB lighting, nor a single one that had macro keys to the degree the G910 did. Your comparison is bad, and you should feel bad.\n\n>Also, gaming keyboards don\u2019t exist. Thats right folks ITS ALL AN ELABORATE RUSE.\n\nNo one really thinks these keyboards work any differently than regular keyboards.\n\n>It didn\u2019t affect my play at all.\n\nNo one thinks these keyboards (outside of macro keys) will actually effect their ability to play games well.\n\n>Before I talk about what boards/brands that are worth the money I would like to bring up what I think to be the biggest and most important factor in a gaming keyboard. SIZE. Now it might sound strange at first but seriously if you haven\u2019t tried a 60 percent keyboard or a tenkeyless what the fuck are you waiting for.\n\nI'm waiting for my numpad keys, and macro keys, to not be used. And so far I'm only using them more as time goes by.\n\n>It was even confirmed by a caster for CSGO that 60 percent is the way to go.\n\nIt's a personal preference, not an objective direction.\n\n>Seriously, you do not need a numpad for gaming\n\nSays who? Have you played any games like, say, Starcraft? It's nice having extra keys for extra hotkeys. How about dedicated VoIP buttons? Generally defaulted to numpad. How about if you don't just game. If you do taxes, or any math work, the numpad is the standard design for calculators, and in general easier to use than the number row for strictly numeric inputs. There are many reasons to keep or want a numpad.\n\n>but you do need that space.\n\nMany, if not most, desks have trays/shelves that roll out from beneath the desk dedicated to keyboard and mouse space. If yours doesn't, you can make or buy one.\n\n>It also just puts you in a better and more comfortable position when you game.\n\nHow? You can literally just move the keyboard if it makes you uncomfortable. Same with the mouse. This just sounds like shitty space management, or not enough space. That can be fixed a myriad of different was.\n\n***TL;DR you're preferences are not empirical fact, and you should fucking use something before passing judgement on it.***"], [3, "I don't know about you but to me the macro keys of a K95 are priceless, and while not everyone wants to have 18 buttons bound to programs or controls to programs, having them for me is a huge selling point."], [3, "I had a K70 for about a week and had tons of problem with the software crashing and just being difficult and annoying to use.

Perhaps it's maybe because I only use it to create macro's and change my lightning.  \n\n**The keyboard itself**  \nThe keyboard itself is good, it has a strong material and doesn't feel like plastic, that's why I also chose Corsair over Razer. If you want a keyboard that doesn't feel / looks cheap, Corsair is a good brand. Now for the K95 itself, when I bought it, I knew and expected it to be huge, but it's really huge.

(I checked up on him recently, still working normally, he had the regular for 4 months before I got it) The keyboard still works fine, the leds still work fine, and the software is awesome looking, but tends to use 270MB of ram and the stats (tracks keystrokes to see how much you press them, I like it) uses 124MB which is certainly way too much if you have a standard pc build, but I have 24GB so it isn't a big deal.\n\n##The Board\n  \nIs nice, the plastic on it will last longer than the switches, the construction is nice, the macro keys are nice, and having fn keys is nice. It has on board macro recording, and the lighting, once you set it up which is a pain in the ass, is the best on the market. The software is horrible for doing the lighting, but after that headache it is fine. Minus 1 point for more taxing software, current worth it value 9/10 price point 10/10  \n  \n##The Switches  \n  \nAre chinese knockoffs of cherry mx blues, but if you have typed with blues before (I own a strafe rgb with blues, I got it for the corsair lapdog and my shield/steam streaming to my tv) the difference is minimal. It honestly feels like someone took a batch of mx blues from 2014, and then a batch from 2016, that is the difference imo, it is there, you can tell it is there, but if someone blind folded you and have you one of those switch testers with 3 khail keys and 3 blues you would likely believe them if they said the khails were actually just a different batch of blues. The build quality of them is still fine, according to razer stats I have pressed the a key 52k times in games, s is 45k d is 42k and w is 35k outside of games it doesn't track typing, but I imagine you can add about 30k to all of those. I honestly cannot tells a difference in it from when I first got it and now. Minus one point for knockoff switches, however the switches aren't bad, it's just a dick move not to use MXs for keyboards. 8/10 worth it value 9/10 pricepoint if you really want MX switches, 10/10 if you only want what works.\n\n## The Macros  \n  \nThey have variable delay, you can record the delay, insert a delay, or have no delay. (I have a macro for taunting in smite, touching it and not letting it bottom out does this vetvetvetvetvetvetvetvet) All of the keys except the fn key are programmable to whatever you want, windows shortcuts, media, keyboard function, mouse function, launching programs, macros, switching profiles. So customizing it is pretty easy, and if you live at home you can keep pesky family members away by learning to type in dvorak and swapping the keys while leaving the keycaps in the default position.\n  \n  \n## The Conclusion  \n  \nThe keyboard is nice, it's sleek, it's worthwhile, but it certainly has more flaws than it's corsair counterpart (strafe rgb with blues) and the software is certainly more taxing on your system much more than corsair software. But that doesn't make it a very simple get a strafe rgb instead, it's all about personal preference and what your setup is. If you have a setup with 16+ GB of ram, the software using more resources doesn't matter, if you prefer the lighting of the blackwidow which is certainly better than any competitor imo than you have to decide if you want to lose the better lighting and gain better software and actual blues, or keep the better lighting. The durability of this keyboard is almost as good as actual blues, razer claims the switches last for 60 million keystrokes, and mx claims 50 million for theirs, take that as you will but I don't believe razer on that. This keyboard has stood up to daily rage typing, playing at least 1-2 hours a day of games almost every day for the past 7 months, and the guy I traded for it said he played 2 hours a day after work almost every day. It honestly comes down to the buyer preferences. So final rating is a 8/10 for worth it value, and a 9/10 for pricepoint, it has it's flaws, but the strafe does too, although I can't elaborate on the stafe's flaws since I have only had it for 2 or so months."], [1, "I feel like more people should read more of his reviews over at /r/mk and then this will make more sense.

I don't particularly care about construction quality and all that jazz as long as it just holds up the test of time; and for the most part, the plastic of my G910 will outlast the actual functional parts of the keyboard. Furthermore, I need my numpad, and especially so do I need the actuation to be the way I like it, else I grind my teeth. Furthermore, Omrom's switches are actually fairly well-regarded, about as much as Cherrys.

Why would you STILL choose to buy a gaming keyboard?  \n\nAs for the whole $30 mechanical keyboards argument you made, what the fuck are you thinking?  First of all, you cant even buy a mech for 30 dollars.  Second of all, there is a huge difference in cheap boards vs. nice boards.  Now it is clear that you are a fan of marketing.  It is also clear you haven't tried a quality mechanical keyboard.  Your cheap plastic that makes up your G910 might hold up for as long as some of the better plastics.  It won't hold up as well as metal though.  But you are really kind of missing the whole point of my post once again, the QUALITY of your board is very important.  You see its not just \"how long it will last\" sure if you take care of your G910 it will last a while.  The quality effects the performance of your board.  Imagine you are driving two cars.  The G910 being a relatively nice car.  Lets say a BMW 328i.  Its a nice car.  Don't get me wrong.  It will get the job done time and time again.  But would you still buy that 328i if you could have bought an M5 for a lower price?  No way in hell.  That's the point I am trying to make here.  You are believing that the 328i is better than the M5 currently.  You think it will drive the same, feel the same, last just as long.  No, it won't.  The M5 is going to drive a lot better, you will have a NOTICEABLE difference in performance.  \n\nDo you get my point here?  Quality isn't just about how long it will last.

They aren't appealing to a generic market, because it's still too expensive for most people, who'll just buy membranes and not give a fuck, and as far as mechanical goes, there are cheaper no-name brands that have the same switches, and that's about all that matters.

The reason I find the other keyboards weird is that they offer so little tangible difference between the cheap competition. Gaming keyboards are showy if nothing else. Your suggested keyboards are quite frankly bland, and little more than the keyboard equivalent of named-brand fashion. Sure it may be of better materials, or have X special thing in it, but in reality no-name brand Y does the same damn thing and if both were de-branded they'd look almost identical.\n\n>what is so weird or special about that\n\nThe fact it's unnecessarily expensive.\n\n>So why would you want to pay more for a keyboard if you can get the same thing for a lower price?\n\nI already rebutted this. Gaming keyboards offer more, even if it is just fancy LEDs.\n\n>Also, the boards I mentioned, if you read my post, are overpriced for what you get.\n\nI also explained why they are priced higher. They dominate a market with little competition, and have universally decided a higher price. Such is capitalism.\n\n>You can buy a better keyboard for less money.\n\nNo you can't.

It also uses just as good, if not better, plastics than the Ducky keyboards I've seen.\n\n>the QUALITY of your board is very important.\n\nAgain, that's true, to an extent. Past a certain point you're just sinking money into nothingness, and that goes for anything. Plastics are more than enough for a keyboard, going for metal should be for aesthetics if anything.\n\n> The quality effects the performance of your board.\n\nThis isn't a vehicle. These things can only be *so* fast, and quite frankly you'll never be able to tell the difference in actual performance on a keyboard. Period. At least, between the one's we are talking about. The biggest bottlenecks are your ability to react, and USB polling. And then when you use PS/2 you still have polling, which is likely still slower than the keyboard's circuitry.\n\n> That's the point I am trying to make here.\n\nSee, that'd make more sense if you weren't full of immense amounts of shit.\n\n>Quality isn't just about how long it will last.

Here we go.\n\nYou say I don't actually debunk?  How?  I explain why you shouldn't buy each keyboard and that there are better options.  Which I list in detail.  \n\nI use shitty analogies as a joke but there is good information in my post.  Read a little bit of it and you will see.  You don't even have to read the paragraphs literally just read the TL;DR's and you will see why you shouldn't buy each keyboard. \n\nAs for the fact that I haven't tried some of the boards, there is a reason for it first of all.  I don't want to buy an overpriced keyboard when I could have paid less for something of a higher quality, better form factor, and better feels.  I have also been an active member of r/mk for about a year and a half now.  I also watched and read reviews on all of these keyboards.  So I did try to give fair criticisms of each board.  I didn't give any personal critiques of the boards I didn't try.  Read the TL;DR's for them.  I say corsair is good and if you aren't interested in customizing your board.  And I didn't realize that people here see customization as changing the color of an LED.  To me, that's not customization.  Customization is changing keycaps.  You cannot do that on any of the boards I mentioned.  Keycaps dramatically change the FEELING of a keyboard.  If you have cheap pad printed ABS keycaps, your board is going to feel like shit even if it has good construction.  If you have some nice PBT keycaps on there, you will definitely feel a huge difference in your typing experience.  There are also different profiles to explore, SA and DSA are very interesting and change the feeling of the board too.  My point is, changing the LEDs on a board is cool but it is not going to do anything in terms of the feeling of your board or the quality of it.  It is just a nice feature.\n\nDid you learn nothing from this post?  Their gaming switch is not that great (wow, sound familiar?).  Sure, it has decent quality control and it won't break on you.  Not really the issue here.  The fact that the actuation point is moved .8 up is actually a huge difference.  The switch is VERY light, it is also linear which means that the key is smooth all the way until you bottom out.  Changing the actuation point on these is a huge mistake.  First of all, its really not going to make it that much faster.  Like the .8mm is really not going to make that big of a difference in terms of speed.  But more importantly, it is going to make accidental keystrokes a lot more common.  I have tried light linear boards and just slightly resting your fingers on the keys will register them and it WILL happen.  Trust me, it will be a pain in the ass based off of personal experience.  Even on blues (Clicky switches), it was an issue for me due to the fact that the switch was so light.  This new switch only makes that problem worse.  If all you ever want to do on your keyboard is game, it will be fine.  But even then, with accidental keystrokes it is going to be a pain.  Reds will be a little bit better but they still have most of the same issues.  Bottom out is also different.  r/mk and r/osu both agree that it is just marketing and that there is not going to be a noticeable difference in the speed and that the switch is super light and will be annoying with the higher actuation point.  **Its marketing.  All of the gaming boards have MARKETING for a reason.  You don't see marketing for Filco boards or KUL.  They spend their money on making their boards better rather than having a huge marketing budget for a board that isn't all that great.** \n\nAlso, I listed a bunch of good options.  You can even get a QFR from coolermaster and put a frosty flake (buy it on 1upkeyboards) on it to make the entire keyboard re programmable so you don't even need dedicated macro keys.

I have a Strafe RGB with browns, and the *exact* reason I chose it over other gaming/non-gaming keyboards is the software.\n\nYou see, the software is the selling point for me. It's not the switches, the board quality, the printing-per-keycap, the ability to customize it with custom keycap sets or whatever /r/MK jerks off with. It's the software. And Corsair's is pretty damn good.\n\nAs a lefty, WASD is a no for me. It's uncomfortable, I use my mouse with my left hand and the keyboard with the right one, so the easiest solution for me is to use the arrows/numpad. Now, the thing with games is, when you rebind the numbers to numpad numbers, many of them won't allow it or they'll show annoyingly long names in your screen. Examples:\n\n> Press KP_END for your primary weapon, KP_DOWNARROW for your secondary and KP_PGDN for explosives\n\n> Press KP_LEFTARROW to throw a grenade!\n\n> Press KP_RIGHTARROW to equip your shield\n\nWith the software, I can easily remap the numbers in the keypad so they behave like \"normal\" numbers, giving me a more comfortable gaming experience. Likewise, if I ever happen to play an abhorrent port with no arrows support, I can use the software to easily rebind the arrows to WASD. As you might've guessed already, the numpad is also a big selling point for me, so no TKL/60% keyboards for me either.\n\nSo yeah, as much as I'd like to get a pretty, minimalistic mech like the POK3R, I choose functionality over looks, and that's why I'm thankful gaming keyboards exist.

Which prevents you from getting any aftermarket caps which is just kind of a bummer because that is one of the coolest parts of this hobby.\n\nHere are some actually legitimate pros and cons.\n\n>They have their own switches, cool not all that great but I mean not the worst switches out there either.\n\n[Omron, the makers of the Romer-G switch, is a well-known, well-established industrial manufacturer of switches.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omron#Business_divisions_and_products) While I do agree that Cherry is the undisputed king of keyboard switches, Cherry doesn't do much else, and Omron has experience in other fields, and is especially experienced in making shit last. They're definitely good enough to give Cherry a run for their money, and most *legitimate* reviewers agree.\n\n>Their boards are just kind of weird looking\n\nThis is literally an opinion. If you wanted to comment on it, you should have talked about them looking ***unique***, not weird. Because they are far from weird or out-of-place, as their aesthetic fits into many places, it's just less generic than it's competition. Which is neither bad nor good.\n\n>I don\u2019t think I ever will given the price point of $180. I could get some really nice keycaps or a really nice keyboard for that.\n\nAnd this keyboard is fairly nice, with quite unique, if not nice, keycaps. It's also important to note that the G910 also has some of the best key lighting on the market right now. Among all keyboards.\n\n>weird switches that aren\u2019t that special\n\nWhoa. You hold your shit right there. I've already explained why Omron isn't just some no-name weird switch-maker, unlike Khalil, but Omron's switches are definitely special. I'm not saying their better, that'd be stupid. They definitely take a different approach than Cherry however, having a unique feel, and different forms of damage-prevention. They also have redundancy in they switches, which is definitely special, though, as implied, redundant.\n\n>it\u2019s just kind of a mediocre board\n\nNo it's not. The plastic on it is of sufficient quality, and it's no better nor worse than the competition. The only major difference is that it uses plastic, but you'll be hard-pressed to break the plastic in normal use before the functionality of the keys first.\n\n>honestly for $180 you can do a lot better.\n\nAgain, you need comparisons. You can't just say, there are some Filco keyboards that are better and then expect people to just believe you. I went and looked at Filco keyboards, and there wasn't one, not a single one, that had full RGB lighting, nor a single one that had macro keys to the degree the G910 did. Your comparison is bad, and you should feel bad.\n\n>Also, gaming keyboards don\u2019t exist. Thats right folks ITS ALL AN ELABORATE RUSE.\n\nNo one really thinks these keyboards work any differently than regular keyboards.\n\n>It didn\u2019t affect my play at all.\n\nNo one thinks these keyboards (outside of macro keys) will actually effect their ability to play games well.\n\n>Before I talk about what boards/brands that are worth the money I would like to bring up what I think to be the biggest and most important factor in a gaming keyboard. SIZE. Now it might sound strange at first but seriously if you haven\u2019t tried a 60 percent keyboard or a tenkeyless what the fuck are you waiting for.\n\nI'm waiting for my numpad keys, and macro keys, to not be used. And so far I'm only using them more as time goes by.\n\n>It was even confirmed by a caster for CSGO that 60 percent is the way to go.\n\nIt's a personal preference, not an objective direction.\n\n>Seriously, you do not need a numpad for gaming\n\nSays who? Have you played any games like, say, Starcraft? It's nice having extra keys for extra hotkeys. How about dedicated VoIP buttons? Generally defaulted to numpad. How about if you don't just game. If you do taxes, or any math work, the numpad is the standard design for calculators, and in general easier to use than the number row for strictly numeric inputs. There are many reasons to keep or want a numpad.\n\n>but you do need that space.\n\nMany, if not most, desks have trays/shelves that roll out from beneath the desk dedicated to keyboard and mouse space. If yours doesn't, you can make or buy one.\n\n>It also just puts you in a better and more comfortable position when you game.\n\nHow? You can literally just move the keyboard if it makes you uncomfortable. Same with the mouse. This just sounds like shitty space management, or not enough space.

If you want a keyboard that doesn't feel / looks cheap, Corsair is a good brand. Now for the K95 itself, when I bought it, I knew and expected it to be huge, but it's really huge. Larger then expected so it takes alot more desk space.

(I checked up on him recently, still working normally, he had the regular for 4 months before I got it) The keyboard still works fine, the leds still work fine, and the software is awesome looking, but tends to use 270MB of ram and the stats (tracks keystrokes to see how much you press them, I like it) uses 124MB which is certainly way too much if you have a standard pc build, but I have 24GB so it isn't a big deal.\n\n##The Board\n  \nIs nice, the plastic on it will last longer than the switches, the construction is nice, the macro keys are nice, and having fn keys is nice. It has on board macro recording, and the lighting, once you set it up which is a pain in the ass, is the best on the market. The software is horrible for doing the lighting, but after that headache it is fine. Minus 1 point for more taxing software, current worth it value 9/10 price point 10/10  \n  \n##The Switches  \n  \nAre chinese knockoffs of cherry mx blues, but if you have typed with blues before (I own a strafe rgb with blues, I got it for the corsair lapdog and my shield/steam streaming to my tv) the difference is minimal. It honestly feels like someone took a batch of mx blues from 2014, and then a batch from 2016, that is the difference imo, it is there, you can tell it is there, but if someone blind folded you and have you one of those switch testers with 3 khail keys and 3 blues you would likely believe them if they said the khails were actually just a different batch of blues. The build quality of them is still fine, according to razer stats I have pressed the a key 52k times in games, s is 45k d is 42k and w is 35k outside of games it doesn't track typing, but I imagine you can add about 30k to all of those. I honestly cannot tells a difference in it from when I first got it and now. Minus one point for knockoff switches, however the switches aren't bad, it's just a dick move not to use MXs for keyboards. 8/10 worth it value 9/10 pricepoint if you really want MX switches, 10/10 if you only want what works.\n\n## The Macros  \n  \nThey have variable delay, you can record the delay, insert a delay, or have no delay. (I have a macro for taunting in smite, touching it and not letting it bottom out does this vetvetvetvetvetvetvetvet) All of the keys except the fn key are programmable to whatever you want, windows shortcuts, media, keyboard function, mouse function, launching programs, macros, switching profiles. So customizing it is pretty easy, and if you live at home you can keep pesky family members away by learning to type in dvorak and swapping the keys while leaving the keycaps in the default position.\n  \n  \n## The Conclusion  \n  \nThe keyboard is nice, it's sleek, it's worthwhile, but it certainly has more flaws than it's corsair counterpart (strafe rgb with blues) and the software is certainly more taxing on your system much more than corsair software. But that doesn't make it a very simple get a strafe rgb instead, it's all about personal preference and what your setup is. If you have a setup with 16+ GB of ram, the software using more resources doesn't matter, if you prefer the lighting of the blackwidow which is certainly better than any competitor imo than you have to decide if you want to lose the better lighting and gain better software and actual blues, or keep the better lighting. The durability of this keyboard is almost as good as actual blues, razer claims the switches last for 60 million keystrokes, and mx claims 50 million for theirs, take that as you will but I don't believe razer on that. This keyboard has stood up to daily rage typing, playing at least 1-2 hours a day of games almost every day for the past 7 months, and the guy I traded for it said he played 2 hours a day after work almost every day. It honestly comes down to the buyer preferences. So final rating is a 8/10 for worth it value, and a 9/10 for pricepoint, it has it's flaws, but the strafe does too, although I can't elaborate on the stafe's flaws since I have only had it for 2 or so months.", "id": "d2xlq0g"}], [{"comment": "I feel like more people should read more of his reviews over at /r/mk and then this will make more sense.

After going over your comments, this is what I've been able to discern so far:\n\n * You're insisting you've *never been hacked* and there is no way someone else has performed the ToS-breaching activity you're apparently being accused of because you use the steam app verification. \n\nI can theorize from this that either you're completely mistaken, or the hacking incidents are false-positives because you tend to visit very different locales (like Romania) which may lead to suspicions of hacking if you log into steam from vastly different areas. For now, we'll trust your suggestion that you've never been hacked, and that the likely issue behind the false hacking assumptions is location switches.\n\n * You've ticketed nearly a dozen times with negative responses **after investigations by Steam.** \n\nThis is a little concerning. Not one but two separate customer support teams (Accounts Issues and Steam Client support) have now received and investigated multiple tickets from you and arrived at the same conclusions. \n\n* Steam threatened to go to the police. \n\nThis is pretty rare, and rather alarming. They don't just throw that around without looking into things.\n\n* Eventual flat out ignoring. \n\nThis usually indicates multiple people have looked at your account and your tickets, and a manager has flagged you as DNR. They don't do that lightly. I don't work for nor represent Steam, so I'm not 100% on their policies, but we can make some reasonable assumptions here that \"just ignore him he's annoying and we can't be assed to waste time on the customer who spends thousands of dollars\" wasn't a conversation that happened. \n\n* Several emails to GabeN\n\nI'm adding this in here because the guy has a habit of responding to pretty much everything, and has a reputation for personally responding to tickets, especially ones posted here. It's been 3 hours, so we'll give him some time, but really his input into whats going on is the clincher for me, or another valve employee. Reason being, I only have *your* side of the story, and unfortunately things don't look good for you.\n\n\n**My conclusion:**\n\nOP and his account has been investigated by two different Steam services and multiple employees from each, and all of them arrived at the conclusion he has violated the ToS, and thus been banned. \n\nEven though Steam hasn't the best (or even noteworthy?) customer service sometimes, logic dictates that it is **far** more likely that OP is guilty than an act of such grandiose negligence/incompetence on the part of multiple Steam employees. We're talking a level of fuck up here that is framed and pointed out to future employees on what not to do. Threatening to call the cops cause they can't tell the difference between a legit hacker's activities and OP's regular behaviour after ~3ish years of you using your account without apparent incident? Two different Steam teams buggering up in the exact same ways? Putting him, a customer who spends a boat load of money, on DNR without fully investigating his \"obvious\" innocence? Yeaaaah okay, OP.  \n\nBut! We will see. Perhaps GabeN will swing by with a \"wow, oops\" or another employee. Very likely we will see GabeN swing by and post [this](http://fat.gfycat.com/SoupyCautiousCat.gif) and then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mnYLPxwtc) and promptly leave. \n\n\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n>You can see that I almost only sell items/keys for cash.\n\n...Where is it you get your keys/items from that you sell? I suspect you have been reported by other players because they have purchased non-functioning/temp game keys from you, whether or not you were aware of it. I'm not very familiar with the Steam trading services but AFAIK you can't trade for cash, so you've got to be using outsider trading like Paypal or what have you. Not to mention the items.\n\nAlso, keep in mind Steam can and *does* read your chat logs through Steam, so if one of your customers messaged you and said \"hey whats the deal\" and you said \"lol thanks for the money scrub,\" that could be why Steam was able to shut you down without much effort. They also *can't* see what you do outside Steam, so if you've been receiving stolen goods and paying for them with Paypal, it literally will look like your account is a mule for stolen games without you being able to prove you aren't. Thus b&.\n\n**EDIT 2 and 3:**\n\nOkay, it is mostly CSGO junk. \n\n**I've pretty much seen all I need to see now, people.**\n\nParaphrasing,[*](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/46mndh/im_being_ignored_by_steam_and_this_has_been_going/d06jfq5)\n>I may trade with scammers, I don't know. The ToS only says I *shouldn't* trade outside of Steam with Paypal/Bitcoin cause I'll probably end up working with scammers, it doesn't say that I'm not allowed to. I shouldn't be banned because I thought to myself, \"So what? Only idiots end up working with scammers, Steam is just being silly\" and then ended up working with scammers *after thousands of transactions.* \n\n\n*\"No, John. You are the demons.

I buy cheap items from different websites such as opskins, bitskins, etc... I then trade those items for keys or overpay in items (which I then sell for keys) once I get a good amount of keys I sell them for paypal and bitcoins and start all over again. **I could be unknowningly trafficking stolen keys but I wouldn't be the 1st one in line** if that makes sense (like I would buy them off of legit traders who prob bought them off of scammers or something)\n\n[I understand, I do.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/877/239/d40.gif) It matters not where in the line you are, what matter is *you're in the damn line in the first place.* Steam **cannot** differentiate between your account and one of the many other mules the stolen goods have been passed through *because you operated outside of Steam.* GabeN is, unfortunately for you, not omniscient, despite prior claims of this sub. \n\n**EDIT 5:**\n\nNeato, gold.

Damn man."]], [[{"comment": "This case seems really strange to me for several reasons. After going over your comments, this is what I've been able to discern so far:\n\n * You're insisting you've *never been hacked* and there is no way someone else has performed the ToS-breaching activity you're apparently being accused of because you use the steam app verification. \n\nI can theorize from this that either you're completely mistaken, or the hacking incidents are false-positives because you tend to visit very different locales (like Romania) which may lead to suspicions of hacking if you log into steam from vastly different areas. For now, we'll trust your suggestion that you've never been hacked, and that the likely issue behind the false hacking assumptions is location switches.\n\n * You've ticketed nearly a dozen times with negative responses **after investigations by Steam.** \n\nThis is a little concerning. Not one but two separate customer support teams (Accounts Issues and Steam Client support) have now received and investigated multiple tickets from you and arrived at the same conclusions. \n\n* Steam threatened to go to the police. \n\nThis is pretty rare, and rather alarming. They don't just throw that around without looking into things.\n\n* Eventual flat out ignoring. \n\nThis usually indicates multiple people have looked at your account and your tickets, and a manager has flagged you as DNR. They don't do that lightly. I don't work for nor represent Steam, so I'm not 100% on their policies, but we can make some reasonable assumptions here that \"just ignore him he's annoying and we can't be assed to waste time on the customer who spends thousands of dollars\" wasn't a conversation that happened. \n\n* Several emails to GabeN\n\nI'm adding this in here because the guy has a habit of responding to pretty much everything, and has a reputation for personally responding to tickets, especially ones posted here. It's been 3 hours, so we'll give him some time, but really his input into whats going on is the clincher for me, or another valve employee. Reason being, I only have *your* side of the story, and unfortunately things don't look good for you.\n\n\n**My conclusion:**\n\nOP and his account has been investigated by two different Steam services and multiple employees from each, and all of them arrived at the conclusion he has violated the ToS, and thus been banned. \n\nEven though Steam hasn't the best (or even noteworthy?) customer service sometimes, logic dictates that it is **far** more likely that OP is guilty than an act of such grandiose negligence/incompetence on the part of multiple Steam employees. We're talking a level of fuck up here that is framed and pointed out to future employees on what not to do. Threatening to call the cops cause they can't tell the difference between a legit hacker's activities and OP's regular behaviour after ~3ish years of you using your account without apparent incident? Two different Steam teams buggering up in the exact same ways? Putting him, a customer who spends a boat load of money, on DNR without fully investigating his \"obvious\" innocence? Yeaaaah okay, OP.  \n\nBut! We will see. Perhaps GabeN will swing by with a \"wow, oops\" or another employee. Very likely we will see GabeN swing by and post [this](http://fat.gfycat.com/SoupyCautiousCat.gif) and then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mnYLPxwtc) and promptly leave. \n\n\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n>You can see that I almost only sell items/keys for cash.\n\n...Where is it you get your keys/items from that you sell? I suspect you have been reported by other players because they have purchased non-functioning/temp game keys from you, whether or not you were aware of it. I'm not very familiar with the Steam trading services but AFAIK you can't trade for cash, so you've got to be using outsider trading like Paypal or what have you. Not to mention the items.\n\nAlso, keep in mind Steam can and *does* read your chat logs through Steam, so if one of your customers messaged you and said \"hey whats the deal\" and you said \"lol thanks for the money scrub,\" that could be why Steam was able to shut you down without much effort. They also *can't* see what you do outside Steam, so if you've been receiving stolen goods and paying for them with Paypal, it literally will look like your account is a mule for stolen games without you being able to prove you aren't.

The ToS only says I *shouldn't* trade outside of Steam with Paypal/Bitcoin cause I'll probably end up working with scammers, it doesn't say that I'm not allowed to. I shouldn't be banned because I thought to myself, \"So what? Only idiots end up working with scammers, Steam is just being silly\" and then ended up working with scammers *after thousands of transactions.* \n\n\n*\"No, John. You are the demons.

I buy cheap items from different websites such as opskins, bitskins, etc... I then trade those items for keys or overpay in items (which I then sell for keys) once I get a good amount of keys I sell them for paypal and bitcoins and start all over again. **I could be unknowningly trafficking stolen keys but I wouldn't be the 1st one in line** if that makes sense (like I would buy them off of legit traders who prob bought them off of scammers or something)\n\n[I understand, I do.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/877/239/d40.gif) It matters not where in the line you are, what matter is *you're in the damn line in the first place.* Steam **cannot** differentiate between your account and one of the many other mules the stolen goods have been passed through *because you operated outside of Steam.* GabeN is, unfortunately for you, not omniscient, despite prior claims of this sub. \n\n**EDIT 5:**\n\nNeato, gold.

Each one is different.  Each one is customized to the owners' liking, and that includes the driver sets.\n\nBy the way, Nvidia and AMD don't really bother with good driver sets for Linux either, so that's another issue entirely.\n\nThe biggest problem with adaptation of Linux for gaming is this:  Direct-X vs OpenGL.

Developers aren't even going to bother battling with OpenGL to get it working, when they have Direct-X right there, and it's already baked into Windows.\n\nAs stated by a prior poster, the monopoly of Windows on gaming PC's does suck, but Linux is not a viable contender to replace it."], [-1, "OK, done."]], [[{"comment": "\"If we want games on a truly open and free system, we need to talk with our actions and wallets.\" so you are gonna stop buying windows only games then?

I mean, ultimately it comes down to the actual subject matter on what colors should be used, but I have a really hard time suggesting strict black on white unless it's for a business-tier website.\n\nAs well; while I can't get behind doing really stupid/flashy animations, minimal things can go a very long way. Very simple things like having a div change to a slightly different background color with a transition animation(instead of a hard on/off) can make the difference between if something looks really amateur or professionally done. It can also be super important from a usability standpoint.\n\nI'm also kind of confused how an internet connection would matter at all in that regard, since you can do really simple and effective CSS transitions/hover effects at virtually no size/bandwidth cost(ie: <10KB for the HTML file, and unless you're using a lot of CSS, <10KB for that, as well). Well, unless you're using some ridiculously heavy javascript for some reason, but even then you're not going to be looking at more than 300-500KB total(and I can't imagine it approaching or surpassing that for a class).\n\nIf you're having issues loading it's likely either the website itself is too image/content heavy, or if it's purely the animations it could just be browser compatibility/computer resource issues.\n\n(Note: I have no idea what level you're actually doing work at for this class, I'm just a friendly neighborhood web design student who has seen a lot of people make a lot of mistakes and just offering a little help/input. If you want/need practical examples or reasoning for some of the simple things to do I can provide some.)", "id": "d9yr86p"}, {"comment": "Nah, keep it simple, high contrast, and clean to look at, that's what I say. Websites like [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/) and Wikipedia are easy to design, easy to maintain, and aren't going to marginalise anybody with visual difficulties (unlike the \"perfect\" website my lecturer showed us, which was almost invisible to the colour blind kid sat next to me). \n\nThe website I've got to make is an online CV for myself, all I'm planning is three pages; employment history, hobbies, contact information (all with pictures). Very simple, no nonsense. So easy that a person with zero prior experience in web design and zero interest in continuing studying web design once this mandatory module is over could do it. My lecturer wants to see us create this nonsense where you have to click a button in order to read the next sentence, which will get rid of the previous sentence. Whenever I come across a website like that, the button I click on is home.\n\nIt's probably got something to do with the fact that all internet in my village goes through the phone lines still, which were laid whenever the RAF base was built. Late thirties, early forties it would have been. Fancy websites with lots of colours and fonts, images, drop down menus, or autoplay backgrounds ([e.g.](https://www.battlefield.com/games)) are completely unloadable on bad days, and take forever to load on good days. I say this marginalises communities with poor internet connections, because it restricting their access to online services. Can't do shit about it because it would cost bloody British Telecom too much money to upgrade our area.\n\nSo I'm studying digital forensics at my first year of university, and for some reason web development is a mandatory module. I expect I'll see why later in the year, but at the moment it looks like a bit of a piss take, especially when we're being assessed by our lecturer's standards rather than international/national standards, and our lecturer is the arch-hipster of web developers. \n\nI think about it from the perspective of a kid who grew up with technophobic parents in a community that is predominately retired and out of touch with technology: too many colours, graphics, moving parts, and lights are confusing to users, and if it is hard for a single user to read, then it's wrong as far as I'm concerned. It needs to be accessible for everybody.", "id": "d9ytanv"}, {"comment": "I'd still recommend doing some form of added color. While I understand what you're going for, high contrast black and white, again, works completely fine for anything business-tier, but this is a site that represents *you*. Even if it's entirely unrelated to your field, if you're linking to the site for your CV/anything else for an employer, presentation can have an impact. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/JGWJJkT.png) is a really quick/dirty example of what I mean with the text. You don't need to go into actual RGB spectrum of things, just using different shades of dark gray, or using different types of off-white can make a pretty heavy visual impact, while still being very simple and non-gaudy. It also lets you create a specific color palette that can tie the page and different elements together(you really want to be at least tri-tone in the design just for that).\n\nAnd your teacher, while I definitely don't agree at all with that approach(it's really awful on the usability front and on the design side), I can *sort of* understand it because while you're right, that sounds like it would both look and feel really awful, it can be argued to at least seem impressive from a web development standpoint. And it *is* possible to make something that you have to \"click through\" actually look and feel impressive that would \"wow\" a prospective employer, it's also incredibly hipster-tier front end design and I'd want to say a little complicated and far too hard to pull off purely for a class that isn't portfolio-review level for a design major.\n\nFor the loading issue, your example makes perfect sense as for why it wouldn't load very easily/well on a slow connection, but it's also running a lot of heavy scripts and auto-playing HTML5 video as a background. I'm just having a hard time seeing how something as simple as a CV/portfolio page could be nearly that heavy(ie: my portfolio is about 2.3MB~ for the splash page, with 2MB being images). I mean, CSS animations are incredibly light-weight, can be really flashy and can make a huge difference when done properly. It just makes me question if there's something else going on(browser compatability/plugin interference), or if there's a huge image being loaded somewhere.\n\nAnyway, from what I'm used to, the instructor grading on \"their\" standards is really normal and day to day. Though I honestly can't tell if your teacher is grading it as a web *development* class/project, or a web *design* class/project, since they can be pretty different and design is...

I have had some problems with them in the past, though i do understand the shadiness of that transaction.

Given the nature of the pricing sometimes, many will auto-pick the front ones, and the front ones usually get put back often. Opt for top-top staff shelving ones, if available.\n* Never get the display model (of course), of anything (see cases and motherboard sections)\n* The Fremont store has many of the items on the above shelves, which require staff assistance. I however, am tall enough to reach that coveted shelf, so i always opt for those, instead of the bottom, consumer shelves.\n* The Fremont store also has the CPUs and RAM locked in a cage behind the resgisters: i always inspect the box they give me before running my credit card. Same rules apply, since they just grab the nearest one. Don't be afraid to ask for a second (or third) box for comparison.\n\n\nI haven't had an issue since in 10 years.

He constantly complained that his frames were choppy and thought one of his cards was defective.  He tried each individually and they worked fine, so he sold one of them and kept the one.  A month later this became news and I showed it to him and he was upset.  Spent money on 2 cards and had to sell it back at a lesser price used because it was unusable.

I don't think you read my entire post \"The moral of this story is a little bit tongue in cheek and a little serious.\".  That is one of the more tongue in cheek and serious bits.

But it took another company to make them realize this is possible.  Again, some of this is extreme examples.\n\nAs for treating people with older GPU's like shit. I thought that too, until I looked into it.  Nvidia from the 600 series to the 900 series had a massive architecture change. This brought with it massive performance boost to tessellation.  Kepler was not so great at tessellation but Maxwell improved performance by a fair amount.  AMD has been using the same architecture for the last few years, so of course those are going to be more optimized than say a new architecture with improved features.  The complaint about the 970 3.5g is the same thing.

PCs can use controllers, but consoles cannot use mice. PCs can emulate console games (for free), but consoles can't even play their own product one generation back until it's approved by the console creator. PCs can play online for free, consoles can't. PCs support mods, which can sometimes provide an entirely new game for free - graphics mods, gameplay mods, everything. PCs are the most powerful, by far - [consoles have been shown in real-world measurements to be unable to outperform even the lowest-end PC graphics cards of **2014** like the (currently $100) 750Ti](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/149-nvidia-gtx-750-ti-unveiled-plays-titanfall-better-than-xbox-one/1100-6417813/) and [R7 260X](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-r7-260x-vs-next-gen-console). As the PC continues to get new generations of cheaper and more powerful graphics cards every single year, consoles fall farther and farther behind in a race where they've already been lapped twice.\n\nAll they have left is *hostageware* - games they strategically buy out from under the feet of innocent gamers on other consoles and the PC so they can sell them back to you, shackled to an outdated $400 piece of shit that costs money every month just to play.

PCs can use controllers, but consoles cannot use mice. PCs can emulate console games (for free), but consoles can't even play their own product one generation back until it's approved by the console creator. PCs can play online for free, consoles can't. PCs support mods, which can sometimes provide an entirely new game for free - graphics mods, gameplay mods, everything. PCs are the most powerful, by far - [consoles have been shown in real-world measurements to be unable to outperform even the lowest-end PC graphics cards of **2014** like the (currently $100) 750Ti](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/149-nvidia-gtx-750-ti-unveiled-plays-titanfall-better-than-xbox-one/1100-6417813/) and [R7 260X](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-r7-260x-vs-next-gen-console). As the PC continues to get new generations of cheaper and more powerful graphics cards every single year, consoles fall farther and farther behind in a race where they've already been lapped twice.\n\nAll they have left is *hostageware* - games they strategically buy out from under the feet of innocent gamers on other consoles and the PC so they can sell them back to you, shackled to an outdated $400 piece of shit that costs money every month just to play.

PCs and consoles are the same thing, except consoles have software (roads) and hardware (engine) that are completely off limits to the consumer once you buy it.\n\nFrom the Why PC guide at the top of our sub:\n\n###\"Why do you care what others buy and play games on?\"\n\nThat's a great question. We (the PC gamers) love gaming and the game industry with a burning passion. Unfortunately for the industry, modern consoles are sucking it dry. No, that's not to say *every* console manufacturer is responsible for this, and it's also not to say the ones that *are* responsible are doing it *all the time*, but it's still harmful. Consoles are directly harming developers, gamers, and the PC platform with their petty exclusivity and dishonest marketing wars.\n\nNowadays, the console business is no longer about satisfying gamers and developers; it's about building a monopoly so they can forcefully attract and [monetarily drain developers to the point where they can't afford to develop a quality game on a competing platform (Sony has been known to starve developers to the point where they may opt to skip competing game platforms)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR8CVLVmKQs#t=286) (hence, bad ports). It's about bribing them if they can't attract them through marketshare ([paid exclusivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_exclusivity)). It's about doing whatever it takes to lock up as many franchises as possible to your own platform so the competition has none left, which leaves you with more market share (and consequently, power). They've focused so much on killing competing platforms that they have no money left to make the consumers a product that makes them happy. You, as a gamer, should be pissed at what they're doing to you and your favorite games. If you understand this and continue to defend what they're doing simply because of brand loyalty, you really need to reconsider your reasoning. Consoles take away WAY more than they give, and that's all the justification anyone should ever need when they try showing someone better alternatives.\n\n**Consoles hurt**: PC gamers, console gamers, and game creators.\n\n**Consoles help**: The manufacturers that created and fiercely market them, developers that were purchased by a console manufacturer, and \"journalists\" that side with them. That's it.\n\nIn comparison: **The PC helps** all of the following:\n\n* Hardware manufacturers (Asus, AMD, Gigabyte, XFX, EVGA, Intel, Seagate, etc)\n* Software companies (Unity Technologies, Adobe, Mozilla, CD Projekt Red, Google, Dropbox)\n* Game creators (Blizzard, Gearbox Software, Crytek, Valve, CD Projekt Red, id Software, Rockstar, Devolver Digital)\n* PC gamers\n* Console gamers (by giving console manufacturers a standard to aspire for, unfortunately they just use marketing to justify shooting for the bottom of the bin)\n\nand finally, **PC hurts** all of the following:\n\n* Profit margins of console manufacturers\n* Developers that signed away their rights or entire existence over to console manufacturers\n* \"Journalists\" that rely on pro-console and anti-PC FUD to pay their bills [^[1]](http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2010/06/microsofts_e3_xbox_bribery_makes_journalism_ethicists_squirm.html)\n\n\n\nIt's a well thought-out systematic scam that's hurting everyone, including you. Consoles are no longer a 'cool and innovative' thing that developers intentionally choose based on compatibility with their artistic vision (as was the case in the 1980s-1990s before the 'new age' of PC graphics). They're something developers *have* to work with and water their games down to be compatible with (because they're either a subsidiary of Sony or Microsoft, or they have no other choice), something that many gamers *have* to buy (because of marketing lies and forced/bribed exclusivity), and that PC gamers *have* to deal with (because so many people got tricked into buying them and developers prioritize that large and weak-hardwared demographic over the PC). Sony and Microsoft entered the turf of the PC gamer when they attacked our games, our developers, and our industry. Console manufacturers aren't your friends. They're made by conglomerates that know nothing of the game industry and see nothing more than a cash cow when they look at gamers. They don't care about giving you good hardware, good games, or good experiences. They care about making the industry THEIRS and locking everyone in to their deadly cycle and they'll put out any marketing lies they need to to get people to [fight for them (they know the psychology, and they know they have the power to trick people into defending them)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ci4q2BixHFE?autoplay=1&vq=hd720). So, if you care about the game industry and innovation, understand this: They're draining the industry dry and putting their \"dirty money\" in absolutely no places that benefit you or the industry. A world of gaming without consoles holding it back would be an amazing one. The next time you see someone arguing against consoles, just remember this before you confront them: **Sony and Microsoft picked the fight, not us.**\n\nHere's an [amazing quote](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3c7wsd/meanwhile_in_an_alternate_universe/cst5udt) from /u/MangoTangoFox that helps explain this section:\n\n>It can never be this way because literally all of the platforms except PC are owned by single companies who created said platform(s) primarily to act as middlemen. Every choice made is done to make the most money, and that includes buying up whole game studios and timed/permanent exclusivity of games and services in order to make their's more appealing than the others. PC isn't even vaguely similar because of the fragmentation of manufacturers, service providers, and creators, allows considerable freedom of choice for the consumer, and doesn't really allow or call for paid exclusivity of certain titles.\n\n>If you think of the characters as the companies who own them, all the consoles despise each-other and would do anything to win any competition between them. If you think of them as the consumers that play them, everyone making a different choice forces exclusivity and anyone not wealthy enough to own all platforms and all the games they want, is getting screwed by that system. You can appreciate people who have similar interests, but it's hard to just say \"let's all just have fun\" when 1. you literally cannot with huge numbers of people because of lack of cross platform multiplayer, and 2. people supporting other platforms allows their greedy existence in the first place, which lessens your own experience as a result because of wasted dev time and paid exclusivity. And even if you own all of them, you still get screwed because the most competent, versatile, and potentially powerful platform you own isn't getting dozens of games you want, and many of the ones it does get aren't anywhere near as amazing as they could have been if the other lesser platforms didn't have so much market/mind-share. So with all the platforms, most of the games that aren't PC exclusive out of necessity in the first place, are likely lesser than they could have been.\n\nHere's another, from /u/snaynay\n\n>Consoles are bleeding this dry, especially in the big-budget gaming department. Ultimately what happens is hoards of kids put up a brick wall of ignorance and stupidity over a lack of a long-term gaming background, defend consoles, accept bullshit and let console manufactures and their associated developers castrate this industry.\n\n>Its not wrong to own or prefer consoles. I thoroughly understand demographics. Hell, the notion of choice is what PC gamers live by. What I care about is this social engineering and phenomena to systematically reject the that PC platform that is the beating heart of the gaming industry. Its not competing with their precious little gaming boxes, its their support.

I have had to pay as much as $160 for a book that was required and the excuse was \"well, you can use it for the full year\" meaning 3 classes in a series (Biology).  I have had books as cheap as $30, but had to buy 3 different ones in that range adding up to $90 for one class (Native Americans of Oregon).  I also once took Art History of Japan as my art credit, and refused to buy the $210 book that was good for the full Art history of Japan/China/India series (3 classes - 1 year).  I ended up paying for $30 worth of photo copies from the *one* library edition so I could continue to get \"A\"s.  Generally as much as a third of the material from the final would be from a required book, and never mentioned in the lectures, guaranteeing a mediocre grade if you didn't read the required chapters.

My opinion although I believe this is widely supported as historical fact: In the United States Higher Education was often used  to keep the *classes* occupationally separate.  The GI bill after world war II did a tremendous amount to undo this historical injustice, as does Federal Student Aid and subsidized student loans, but we still live with this legacy today and the rate of educational inflation has caused the cost to once again soar to a near unobtainable height.  Since the worst \"D\" grade engineer is still able to get a white collar job and the smartest, most talented, and most experienced technicians I know are still never able to get out of their \"blue collar\" jobs, which generally top out at a pay level half of the worst entry level white collar positions, I think we are well on our way to reestablishing the great divide between the classes.

They have quite a few options there that work well and are proven.\n\nAs far as your build, it looks pretty good. I don't know what your budget is so I can only give some general feedback on the parts that you picked.\n\n1) If you ever plan on upgrading or putting more things in your case, go with ATX Mid, not Micro, as it is a noticeably smaller case and makes things like cable management and upgrading far more difficult.\n\n2) I see you picked an unlocked processor but went subpar on the motherboard. Unless the motherboard is an Intel Z series (you have a B85), it won't properly utilize overclocking, or may require workarounds to achieve. For best results, use a Z97 or equivalent motherboard.\n\n3) I would check if the CPU Cooler you want comes with thermal paste, otherwise you will need to buy some. The CPU cooler doesn't just sit right on the CPU, there needs to be a small amount of thermal paste between them.\n\nOther than that, it seems pretty solid. If you can afford it, the 390x is far better than the 390 for a small price increase usually.\n\n----\n\nI went ahead and modified your list slightly with a number of improvements while still trying to cut costs where possible.\n\n[PCPartPicker part list](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/XxjDrH) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/XxjDrH/by_merchant/)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [Intel Core i5-4690K 3.5GHz Quad-Core Processor](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i54690k) | \u00a3181.29 @ Amazon UK \n**CPU Cooler** | [Cooler Master Hyper TX3 Evo 43.1 CFM CPU Cooler](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-cpu-cooler-rrtx3e22pkr1) | \u00a315.99 @ Amazon UK \n**Motherboard** | [ASRock Z97 Anniversary ATX LGA1150 Motherboard](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-z97anniversary) | \u00a367.98 @ Ebuyer \n**Memory** | [Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-memory-cml8gx3m2a1600c9) | \u00a334.49 @ Ebuyer \n**Video Card** | [MSI Radeon R9 390 8GB Video Card](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r9390gaming8g) | \u00a3269.99 @ Ebuyer \n**Case** | [Corsair 200R ATX Mid Tower Case](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-case-200r) | \u00a354.50 @ Amazon UK \n**Power Supply** | [EVGA SuperNOVA NEX 650W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-120g10650xr) |-\n**Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM (64-bit)](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/microsoft-os-kw900140) |-\n**Monitor** | [Asus VG248QE 144Hz 24.0\" Monitor](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-monitor-vg248qe) | \u00a3217.98 @ Amazon UK \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **\u00a3842.22**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2016-04-11 16:19 BST+0100 |", "id": "d1yion1"}, {"comment": "I'm pretty sure coolermaster include thermal paste.

They are also free to release that game with or without DRM.\n\nNot only do publishers have freedom, customers have freedom too. They can install however many distribution platforms they want on their computer, be it GoG, Origin, Uplay, Windows Store, etc.\n\nSteam is just where the games *are,* and it's where the customers *are.* Yes, that gives them some leniency as far as having shitty customer support and whatnot. But **they can only be so shitty.** *Since both customers and publishers have freedom, they still risk losing customers if they piss everyone off, and this is what distinguishes them from a true monopoly.*\n\nAnd it wouldn't be as difficult as it sounds. Yes, indies have to be wherever the majority is. But AAA publishers are extremely influential, and very agile. Look at EA and Ubisoft. They only run their own show to maximize profit, and because they can. But they could easily overtake Steam if the need arose.\n\nBut does that really need to happen? We love to shit on Valve, but what have they really done?\n\n* They have crappy customer support.\n\n* They tried to make money off of mods once.\n\n* They have had a security breach (as have XBL and PSN, and theirs have been as bad or worse).\n\nThat's just about it, as far as the major issues go.\n\nValve is not \"run like a lemonade stand;\" everyone else is just as bad.\n\n**No** company is a \"good guy,\" and **no** company has you in mind and in heart. Not even CDPR. *All for-profit companies exist to make money* first and foremost. But, by and large, Valve's *interests* line up with our own. \n\n*We want to be free from Microsoft* so we can be in charge of our computers and our privacy. *Valve wants us to be free from Microsoft* so SteamOS can be successful. Different means to the same end.\n\nWhat about Microsoft? Aren't they just making money too? Of course. *But their interests don't line up with ours.* They want to keep us locked in to Windows, because Windows makes them money. We don't want that.\n\nYou might say that Valve **also** wants to keep us locked in to **Steam**, because **Steam** makes them money. Yes, one could perhaps argue that operating systems are the same as game distribution platforms. You might point out that one can have multiple OSes installed on the same computer, and that nothing prevents developers from developing for multiple operating systems. However, it's a very different situation, and that isn't an entirely correct statement.\n\nThere's very little inconvenience in running multiple game distribution platforms. Yeah, they take up a bit of disk space, but you can have multiple running at the same time, and there's not much learning curve. Operating systems take up a *lot* of disk space, you can't have multiple running at the same time (in a state where they can run games, without expensive dedicated hardware and a lot of configuration), and there's a *hell* of a lot of a learning curve. You can, however, have a dual-boot. That isn't too hard to set up in and of itself, and it's a decent compromise for a lot of people. But it's still a very different situation.\n\nRunning multiple operating systems requires a travel outside of the comfort zone that most users will not cross. Not so with game distribution platforms.\n\nAnd, yes, a developer can publish to multiple game distribution platforms just like they can develop for multiple operating systems. But the former requires some file uploading, and perhaps a bit of paperwork. Potentially some dev work if they previously used Steamworks. The latter requires a complete reworking of the game, and countless man-hours. It's actually sometimes not even possible (without compatibility layers) if a proprietary component of their game isn't compatible with Linux.\n\nDeveloping for multiple operating systems requires a travel outside of the comfort zone that most devs will not cross. Not so with game distribution platforms.\n\nIf you care about Valve's \"monopoly,\" but don't care about Windows' monopoly, you *don't care.* The latter actually exists, and it is a far greater issue.", "id": "d01f4r5"}, {"comment": ">So does Microsoft, and their grip is even stronger, and more dangerous.\n\nNo they don't.  Microsoft isn't the one who has the power to make paid mods a reality.  Microsoft isn't the one who has the power to make thousands of PC games vanish in an instant.  It would be one thing if their storefront was anything at all successful, but it is not and will likely not be.  Microsoft is not the company that has popularized the usage of DRM and has lead to the PC being a platform where you cannot own your games (legally of course).  Even if Microsoft were to stop all production of windows tomorrow people would still be able to play PC games even legally through steam, and I cannot say the same for steam closing down tomorrow.  Microsoft may have a virtual monopoly on PC OS, but that is a separate issue from PC gaming.  To put it simply Valve is to PC gaming as what Microsoft is to PC operating systems.  \n\n>First of all, I wouldn't even call Valve's dominance a \"monopoly.\" If a publisher releases a game on Steam, they are still free to release that game independently or on GoG. They are also free to release that game with or without DRM.\n\nThat's why it's called a virtual monopoly.  The illusion of choice is a strong one.  \n\n> Steam is just where the games are, and it's where the customers are. Yes, that gives them some leniency as far as having shitty customer support and whatnot. But they can only be so shitty. Since both customers and publishers have freedom, they still risk losing customers if they piss everyone off, and this is what distinguishes them from a true monopoly.\n\nYes, in the same way that ISPs can \"lose support\" by being shitty. Meaning that consumers give up their internet entirely (or in this case give up gaming or start pirating meaning the death of the PC as a platform)   It is not a pretty solution and that's why there need to be more storefronts that developers put their games on.   Don't worry about that though.  Valve won't make a decision that will cause the need for people to switch to other platforms, and what I mean by that is with the rapid growth of valve drones they could not possibly make a bad decision.  I mean people are already defending their paid mods situation to the death.  They are already defending their grip on PC gaming.  They are already defending the shitty way they handled the security breach.  They are already defending them taking games out of people's library.  With this trend in 20 years Valve can retake all your games and recharge you for them and their drones would defend them to the very core. \n\n>And it wouldn't be as difficult as it sounds. Yes, indies have to be wherever the majority is. But AAA publishers are extremely influential, and very agile. Look at EA and Ubisoft. They only run their own show to maximize profit, and because they can. But they could easily overtake Steam if the need arose.\n\nValve only runs their show to maximize profit as well.  I seriously doubt they \"could easily overtake Steam if the need arose\" as well.  We're talking about basically thousands of games completely disappearing.  If steam continues its trend of being the only storefront with games the downfall of it will be catastrophic for PC gaming and likely completely destroy the platform.\n\n>Not even CDPR. All for-profit companies exist to make money first and foremost. But, by and large, Valve's interests line up with our own.\n\nNo they line up with YOUR own interests.  Supporting and pushing DRM down everyone's throats is not my interest nor should it be.    If they do not care to eliminate DRM (let's be real the made DRM for PC real at the benefit of none)  then they sure as hell do not care about Linux in the slightest.  Once steam machines flop they will abandon Linux in its entirety.  \n\nAlso, me supporting GOG is not the same as you blatantly damage controlling for Valve's behavior.  GOG is the underdog.  They are not from a position of power.  They are not the virtual monopoly.  Their sentiments are the same as those of PC gamers.  \n\n\n>They have crappy customer support.\n\nAbsolutely inexcusable.  Steam itself is a billion dollar company.  The fact that you understate this is simply laughable.  \n\n>They tried to make money off of mods once.\n\nDamage control of the year award.  No they didn't try to make money off of mods \"once\".  They STILL want paid mods and are \"waiting\" for the right time to do so.  \n\n>They have had a security breach (as have XBL and PSN, and theirs have been as bad or worse).\n\nYes, a security breach comparable to PSN in which they did not give away free games or anything.  In which they barely issued an apology a day or so after.  In which the entire time they stayed completely and utterly silent about the incident.  That is not how you run a company.  In fact, I'm utterly ashamed at the PC community for being so forgiving of Valve after that.  The same community that advocates for consumer activism and awareness.  The same community that says to be weary of corporations has found itself completely outclassed by console peasants regarding the security breach.  Frankly, it was pathetic.  People who say that steam is console gaming on PC are frankly becoming more and more right.  The phenomenon of PC \"gamers\" who play CS:GO and Dota 2 all day while defending Valve at every cost like the good little drones they are is rampant.  \n\nYou seem to have left out quite a bit so I'll help you:\n\n1. Valve has stopped fixing and improving their client be it the broken steam greenlight or extremely dumb design choices regarding steam workshop. \n\n2. Even though it was an isolated incident with the game not functioning anymore Valve has taken blatant anti-consumer decisions and removed an entire game people paid for completely from their library.  \n\n3. Since they are no longer competing they have given up making games.  They have really given up on anyone.  How poorly they run steam has become accepted as common place.  \n\nFrankly, the rest of your comment is an attempt at deflection by shifting the issue to OS.  That is not what we're discussing. I touched upon it briefly in my first response, but it holds no place in this discussion.  I do care about Microsoft's virtual monopoly on PC operating systems which is why I dual-boot Linux and I do not buy windows.  I also care about Valve's monopoly on PC gaming which is why I try to support  other distributors as much as possible (frankly there are no other distributors with games it's either a choice of supporting developers of a game or pirating it) ", "id": "d01h0qo"}, {"comment": ">Microsoft isn't the one who has the power to make paid mods a reality. Microsoft isn't the one who has the power to make thousands of PC games vanish in an instant.\n\nNot only is the former not a significant issue, and not only does Valve *not have* the latter power (they would get sued to oblivion), but **Microsoft has far greater power than that. They run the whole damn show.** You're bikeshedding specific issues (paid mods, power over game ownership), but I could go on for *days* with a list like that for Microsoft.\n\n>That's why it's called a virtual monopoly. The illusion of choice is a strong one.\n\n*I will concede* that it has a virtual monopoly in the sense that if you want certain games, those games will probably only be on Steam. \n\nBut that's not the only kind of monopoly Steam is. It's also a [natural monopoly.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly) Because of that, **there will always be a dominant marketplace**, and the marketplace in a position of dominance will never share all of your sentiments. You negatively agreed with that latter point when you said that GOG shares your sentiments by virtue of it being an underdog.\n\n>Yes, in the same way that ISPs can \"lose support\" by being shitty.\n\nISPs? That's exactly what I was alluding to as a contrast. While, as I agreed, Steam is in some ways a monopoly, they have nowhere near as much market dominance as an ISP. If Steam even held a *candle* to Comcast's shittiness, they'd have been blown out of the water.\n\n>Valve only runs their show to maximize profit as well.\n\nOf course Valve also only wants to maximize profit. As I said, all for-profit companies do everything for profit. That wasn't a contrast I was trying to make.\n\n> I seriously doubt they \"could easily overtake Steam if the need arose\" as well. We're talking about basically thousands of games completely disappearing.\n\nYes, they could. There's a threshold of Valve shittiness at which this would happen. Also, games wouldn't disappear. Valve would get sued. Yes, there was that *one* game where Valve nuked all traces of it from orbit when the multiplayer servers went down. The only reason nothing happened was that no one gave a shit. The game would still have been unplayable even if they left it alone, and it was pretty unpopular to begin with. Yes, it sets a bad precedent, but it made pragmatic sense.\n\n>If steam continues its trend of being the only storefront with games the downfall of it will be catastrophic for PC gaming and likely completely destroy the platform.\n\nHow?\n\n>Supporting and pushing DRM down everyone's throats is not my interest nor should it be.\n\nBlame the publishers, not Steam. The publishers want DRM on their games, and they will get it one way or the other. Steam can do nothing about this. They simply provide it. If Steam dies, it will not be replaced by GOG, it will be replaced by a different DRM.\n\nIf your fight is against DRM, fight the publishers, don't fight Steam. As I said, if you slay the mighty Steam, it will only be replaced by more DRM. You're treating the symptoms, not fighting the infection.\n\n>If they do not care to eliminate DRM (let's be real the made DRM for PC real at the benefit of none) then they sure as hell do not care about Linux in the slightest.\n\nAs I've said, they don't care about anything. Companies don't care. Companies make money.\n\nIn this case, Valve wants to make money by supporting Linux. I support Valve because of that common interest, despite the differing reasons.\n\n>>They have crappy customer support.\n\n>Absolutely inexcusable. Steam itself is a billion dollar company. The fact that you understate this is simply laughable.\n\nI think you underestimate the number of billion dollar companies with shitty customer support relative to their customer support needs. No, those other companies shouldn't be having that problem either, but the mere fact that they are a billion dollar company is not a valid premise for your argument.\n\n>No they didn't try to make money off of mods \"once\". They STILL want paid mods and are \"waiting\" for the right time to do so.\n\nReally?\n\n>Yes, a security breach comparable to PSN in which they did not give away free games or anything. In which they barely issued an apology a day or so after. In which the entire time they stayed completely and utterly silent about the incident. That is not how you run a company. In fact, I'm utterly ashamed at the PC community for being so forgiving of Valve after that.\n\nFirst of all, no, it was not comparable to PSN. Not even close. The PSN breach nearly made records. [About 77 million accounts were compromised.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage) The Steam breach? [34,000.](http://store.steampowered.com/news/19852/) That's like comparing a car crash to 9/11.\n\nNot only that, but if you look at the Wikipedia page I referenced for that 77 mil statistic, you can see that Sony's response to the breach (they waited nearly a *week* to *vaguely* confirm the breach) was just as bad, if not worse, especially given that there were 2000x more compromised accounts.\n\n>Frankly, the rest of your comment is an attempt at deflection by shifting the issue to OS. That is not what we're discussing. I touched upon it briefly in my first response, but it holds no place in this discussion. I do care about Microsoft's virtual monopoly on PC operating systems which is why I dual-boot Linux and I do not buy windows. I also care about Valve's monopoly on PC gaming which is why I try to support other distributors as much as possible.\n\nI definitely respect your caring about the OS issue, and concede that my point about you not caring was incorrect.\n\nBut I'm not shifting the issue.\n\nWhile admittedly a bit confusing, OP's post was trying to shift the focus (of the Quantum Break issue) from not only game distributors, but also to operating systems, to show how it isn't a win for PC gamers. This discussion was about operating systems from the get-go. You shifted the conversation away from that, and I'm bringing it back up.\n\nNo, Steam is not perfect. Yes, they have problems that need to be fixed. But the solution is neither to compete with Steam nor to beat Steam. Game distributors are a natural monopoly, so equal competition is not feasible. And it would be foolish to simply overtake Steam just for the sake of overtaking Steam. Then you've got another monopoly, and you're back at square one, because you're not solving the issue.\n\nThe issue is DRM as a whole, not Steam.\n\nAs I said, The publishers want DRM on their games, and they will get it one way or the other. And you destroy Steam, it will only be replaced by more DRM. You're treating the symptoms, not fighting the infection. The infection is publishers wanting DRM, the symptom is Steam. The only solution to that problem, the only cure for the infection, is to make DRM illegal. Period. Yes, really.\n\nBut, as is obvious, DRM is all on a program-by-program basis. There just so happens to be a very big, DRM-infested program that runs on almost every single desktop computer. It's called Windows. Steam is the only hope for Linux to beat Windows in the gaming market, so other than illegalization, Steam is ironically the best hope we've got for a major win against DRM.\n\nSo, if nothing else, perhaps we can see eye-to-eye on that.", "id": "d01liwg"}, {"comment": "This is not an ode to how good Valve is by any means, read my comment.

Valve knows this, which is why Valve is pushing Linux so hard.\n\n\n\nSo last year, there was a big push for Linux support. Mainly backed by Valve's Steam Machines. But because Valve is Valve, they half assed it, and fucked it up over silly trivial things. This scared the shit out of Microsoft, because had Valve not fucked it up, Linux could have been in real running against Windows as a gaming platform by now.\n\n\n\nBut it isn't. But that movement still scared the shit out of Microsoft, so how do they deal with competition? The same way they do on consoles - exclusives. We are looking at a new wave of 'Windows10' exclusives.

Take Android for example. It was first released in 2008, and it was laughably shit. No one took it seriously. Now? It has over 80% of the smartphone market share, and it's far better than iOS for power users and low/mid-income consumers.\n\nThis is how almost all open source projects gain market share. Slowly and steadily. Here's another example: Linux. As a whole. It was first released in 1991, as a little pet project of a Finnish college student. It now powers 99% of supercomputers, 66% of web servers, and over 80% of smartphones (as Android uses the Linux kernel).\n\nHell, let's look at Steam for Linux on the whole. It was released out of beta in late 2013. Less than 3 years after that, we now have 1,944 games. That's 25% of the Steam library. Yeah, it's mostly indies, but most Windows games are indies too. *Most games are indies, period.*\n\nYeah, Linux gaming is on the floor.

Someone might know your email address now...just like every website, discussion board, job application, etc already have on file and fairly easily accessible to anyone slightly computer literate.\n\nI feel like I could do more than that with the fact you most likely live in New South Wales. I'd be more worried that google implies that you may or may not visit xhamster than someone knowing the last 4 numbers of a credit card that you use in public, in front of people everyday. They don't show CVC numbers, expiration dates, name on the card, etc. Those security steps are in place, because the last 4 is just enough to identify the card for your records, but not cause a significant risk in a situation like this.\n\nI agree it's complete bullshit that Valve let this slip by, but people are going a little overboard and borderline attempting to incite riot over this.

Will you be able to game at 4K 30fps? Sure, probably. But for people like me to go out and pick one up, I'm going to want 60fps and for that I'm going to want the option to have it output 1080P. I want to be able to play SW Battlefront splitscreen at 60fps, and I hope the Scorpio delivers that.\n\nEDIT: And if you do want to play 4K today better than the Scorpio will be able to in late 2017, you're going to want to get an Nvidia 1070/1080.

Unless every single person on PCMR reads your comment at the same time that's likely impossible to stop. Gabe worship and framerates, occasionally I'll see a post criticizing console framerates of a game, then right below it there'll be a post about some game running 4k but at a sacrificial 20-40fps like what consoles pull at 720p. \n\nThat's why I still can't trust the ideology of some of these arguments, I mean ideally it's great to run 4k at 60fps, but clearly it isn't a deal-breaker to run 20-40fps if the trade-off is getting 4k without running massive SLI or going at medium settings, or at least that's what I've seen from the posts about pushing rigs to the max.  \n\nSo I suppose it's a 50/50 culture; any step above consoles is great but then after that milestone you can make your own choices of what makes a game visually great or playable. Then again, with a name like \"PC master race\", I'm not sure we were ever suppose to be a 100% serious barometer of playing PC games. \n\n\n\n", "id": "cybua8n"}, {"comment": "I am on mobile and couldn't find it but that was awesome.

Not limiting the scope can be a scary thing, and there's been some shuffling around, but as each section of the article starts from the beginning of development so the rocky parts are a recurring theme, the end of the process largely seems to be that things get better and it wasn't all that incriminating to begin with.\n\nHaving been around various studios over the years, some of this also sounds like plain old workplace whining. Remember, these are all people. The one guy who said having both first person and third person can't be good? Has he never heard of ARMA? Was he interviewed prior to GTA V coming out on PS4?

It is also basically graphics and tech porn for those who appreciate those aspects of games.\n\n  The over the top funding is what has allowed them to do this... Whether it holds up until they can release a functional game, who knows ?"], [16, "> It has micro transactions in a near full priced game.\n\nThe developers have stated several times that when you buy ships, it's supporting the game. This is their funding model - the game would not have been made without it. They have also stated that you will always be able to buy things with in game money once the game releases. The micro transactions are there to give people the option to support the development and get something for their support. \n> It has expensive preorder package bonuses which may possibly give large advantages to players for \npre-ordering with an extremely high upper limit (some packages in the thousands).\n\nLike I said, these are optional purchases to support the development of the game. Additionally, large ships aren't the \"end-all\" of the game. Just like in real life, larger more expensive ships are going to be more expensive to run in game, require more crew, and therefore have a much higher risk than smaller, less expensive ones. (Keep in mind all ships will be purchasable with in game money)\n>It's moving along very slowly, and by all means isnt managed very well (link to investigative article on this).\n\nI wouldn't consider it to be moving along slowly, (more on that later) but the management \"problems\" are something that occur across all game development, and there haven't been many significant issues/red flags. \n>No refunds for pre-orders (yes, its called backing, but to the end consumer, it amounts to the same thing except they have an even smaller obligation to deliver).\n\nHaving refunds on a crowd-funded game, (although nice for the consumer) would be a major headache for the developer. However, the lead developer has said >\u201cIf there are cases where people are really upset, or facing personal hardships, on a case by case basis we take a look and we refund,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep people around. We don\u2019t want to fight with them.\u201d\n>They got crowdfunded instead of getting investors\n\nThis is in my opinion a positive that sets out Star Citizen from something like CoD or NMS. Not having a publisher means no deadlines, no \"pressure to complete\" and lets Star Citizen focus on making the game not hitting deadlines.\n>The company does not have a reputation matching the scope of the game.\n\nand\n>It has continued to barrel off schedule\n\nI'm going to address these points together as they are somewhat related. When the original kickstarter was pitched, Star Citizen was planned at much smaller scope then what it is currently aiming for. Think medium indie game versus full AAA title. However, as they raised more and more money they continued to add features and increase the scale of the game until what it is now. Of course the company doesn't have a reputation - this is the first game that they've ever developed, and of course the game has gone of schedule it's much bigger and much more ambitious then it was 4 years ago. \n>The atmosphere surrounding it seems to be filled with gold medal mental gymnastics from faithful fans anytime any potential flaws are discussed despite it being completely unfinished with little complaint.\n\nThis is a valid concern, but something that has been getting better over the years. It's probably a combination of Buyer's Remorse and hype. When you spend thousands on a game, you're not going to like any criticism that comes your way. Star Citizen has made huge technological advancement however, something that should be applauded in this age of re skinning games every year to make a profit. \n\nOverall, I think Star Citizen is following a transparent development model. It means you get to see a lot of the cool stuff their working on but also see some of the mistakes they've made. The community interaction with the developers is great and how they let the backers provide feedback and support the game really makes me believe that it is headed in the right direction. There have been problems/miscommunications but that's to be expected of any game this scale. We shall see in the future what becomes of their business, and their game. \n"], [12, "Tons of valid comments here supporting Star Citizen, but no one is mentioning how incredibly open the communications are with the developers. There are weekly 30 minute videos, and other streams, newsletters, etc."], [13, "* They got crowdfunded instead of getting investors.\n\nHow in the world is that a negative? Investors can and will dictate game design and change things for the worse to maximize return. Crowdfunding gives the dev a chance to make the game they have always wanted to make (within budget). Seriously, how the hell is this a bad thing?"], [8, "As someone who did back the game with no expectations that it would actually see it's way to a final release (especially on time) I should point out a few things.\n\nThe micro transactions and preorder packages...They're included at the moment for additional crowdfunding. The more money this game sees the more we can get out of it. From what I understand, the things we're paying for are going to be available in game with credits once the game releases. Sure the people who spent thousands before hand to get the best ships will have an advantage somewhat at release but I'm sure it'll even out over a short time. The high price tags are, again, for crowdfunding. I'd imagine some of the skins are going to continue as micro transactions though if I had to be logical based on what games are doing these days.\n\nI'd say being crowdfunded is a whole lot better for this situation because having a company back your game means you have to follow their rules and deadlines. Through crowdfunding, they get to take their time making the game they envision and the one we want. I also doubt any company would have given them $110 million dollars to fund it and likely would've forced this game to push an early release which would cause features to be cut and we'd just have another No Man's Sky. No Thanks.\n\nTrue, the company doesn't have a reputation as whole. If you don't feel comfortable with that then refusing to back it us your choice entirely.\n\nMoving along slow? It's been 5 years. Fallout 4 wasn't anything ground breaking and the engine was used on Skyrim yet still took 7 years. The difference being that we didn't hear about it until less than 2 years to release while we heard about Star Citizen the moment it was being funded. They've also had to take the time to basically create technology that hadn't been done yet in order to support the content they're creating which included modifying the game engine itself.\n\nAs far as going off schedule...yea that sucks. Anytime something you were hoping for gets delayed it definitely sucks. If the past has showed us anything though, choosing for something to be rushed rather than delayed ends up being no good.\n\nAnd trust me, I know there's a chance it would fail. I don't blame people for choosing not to backing it and I understand. I chose to back it because I want to see it finished and it helps that I actively get to test the progress and see how it's going.  This devs are constantly showing the new tech they're working on and it's beautiful. Even if the game doesn't hit it's full release, the technology they've been working can help put advancements in gaming and that along is something to look forward to. I feel if or when SC 3.0 gets released to the backers it would end up putting some peace of mind into people's minds as that's a big step in the games creation (which are features such as procedural planets)."], [7, "I supported it because it is so ambitious that even though it doesn't fulfill every \"dream\" we have, it will still probably be good. \n\nI just believe more in these guys than any other company.

A bigger ship isn't a direct upgrade to a smaller ship, it's an alternative, with pros, cons, and different uses.\n\nYes, some packages are in the thousands. You're not expected to buy them. Those are packages bought by a select few with a lot of money to throw around that want to support the project. (This ties into a later point.)\n\n> Its moving along very slowly, and by all means isnt managed very well (link to investigative article on this).\n\nFirstly, that article is on Kotaku, not known as a reliable source.\n\nSecondly, besides being on Kotaku, that article is riddled with flaws, which have been pointed out time and time again.\n\nThirdly, it's moving along just fine. This is something that is hard for many to see, because Cloud Imperium have given an unprecedented amount of insight into stages of development where many games *would not have been announced yet*, and definitely would not have released any significant details. They have a playable Alpha build which regularly gets updated with new content. They also regularly show off what they're working on.\n\n> No refunds for pre-orders (yes, its called backing, but to the end consumer, it amounts to the same thing except they have an even smaller obligation to deliver).\n\nNo, it doesn't amount to the same thing as the end consumer, unless the end consumer blindly throws money at the game without knowing what they're doing.\n\n*You are backing a product, investing in it. You are not pre-ordering it.*\n\nLike *any crowdfunded project*, there is no obligation to return your funds once you have committed them. And like any crowdfunded project, *it might not meet expectations*. Again, you are not obliged to have your funds returned if the project disappoints. That's how crowdfunding works. If you're not comfortable with that, don't participate in crowdfunding anything with significant uncertainty.\n\n> They got crowdfunded instead of getting investors.\n\nWhile I can appreciate that this is a 'red flag' in the sense that they don't have big money investors breathing down their necks demanding that they deliver, it's also a good thing, because they don't have big money investors breathing down their necks demanding that they deliver.\n\nCloud Imperium is developing some incredible technology for this game. Tech that I guarantee they would not be able to develop with a big money investor involved. This game's 'investors' don't have an expectation of monetary returns; they want a good game. Big money investors throw money at products wanting to get more money back. People throw money at Star Citizen wanting them to use that money to make a better game.\n\n> The company does not have a reputation matching the scope of the game.\n\nThe company has very little reputation, as *it's a new company.*\n\nOn the other hand, it's also managed by a man who - admittedly has his flaws - but has also delivered some very good games in this genre.\n\n> It has continued to barrel off schedule\n\nThe schedule got thrown out of the window once this went from a 'small' project (relative to most games) with a few million involved, to a massive project with $100m+ funding.

My only worry is that they will run out of money before the game is complete.

I don't think I'm a fanboy, I keep an open mind, this could all fail but I'm sure some will label me as such.    \n&nbsp;    \nThe part about \"delays\" just is not applicable at all.  The whole reason they did crowdfunding vs publisher/investors is that they can take the time to build the game they want to build!  They don't have to be rushed because the publisher needs sales this quarter or what not.  Sure they've thrown out some dates in the past and not met them but really they shouldn't have put it out there to begin with because they don't really apply.  They will certainly aim for things, but things change.  Originally procedural planets were not a thing at all, it was just going to be on-rails landing to very narrow pieces of a planet, but they put in the time and money into R&D and managed to make some very powerful tools that allow them way more real-estate than they originally thought and are now adjusting things to fit (by \"now\" I mean like the last year or so).    \n&nbsp;    \nA lot of people will jump to the \"it's been in development for 4yrs already!\" argument.  Which is true it did all start 4yrs ago but that is a bit skewed.  As soon as the kickstarter started they weren't programming day one.  They've spent the last 4 years not only developing two games (Star Citizen & Squadron 42) but also building a company and drastically modifying a game engine as well.  They've had to find offices, buy and build hardware, interview and hire people, train people in some sort of way, build new tools for the engine to allow them to do what they want to do.  All those things and \"normal\" game development things too.  You can look at GTA games, they take around 5yrs to make, but they already have the studio, hardware, software, people, engine in place from the beginning!  How do you think CoD and sports games games get churned out yearly?  They already have all these things in place when they start working on the game, not to mention much smaller in scope games, one could even say \"cookie cutter\" games.    \n&nbsp;    \nI'm not sure what \"reputation\" has to do with anything.  So if someone is not known for a thing they should never try to do that thing?  \"Hey Hyundai, you're only known for shipping, you can't build cars\" only (probably bad) example I could come up with on the spot.    \n&nbsp;    \nYou can't compare any of the items as \"pre-order\" that's really not a fair comparison and very Apples to Oranges.  You are *backing* the game, helping development of it, and for that yeah you get a copy of the game when it's out and some ships if you want.    You are not required to buy any of these, all the ships will be obtainable in-game when it launches.  For $60 you can \"back\" the game and get a copy of Star Citizen, Squadron 42, and a starter ship, that is the bare minimum anyone \"needs\" to purchase if they want to back it and play on day one.  I imagine later on when actual pre-orders begin the prices will go up to $60 each but that is just my guess.    \n&nbsp;    \nI realize I'm not addressing these in order at all.  I'm not sure what you mean by \"micro transactions\".  They haven't mentioned any of their launch/post-launch details for the game other to say that the \"buying\" of ships with real money will not continue when the game is live.  Anything you can buy now on their site is because you want to back the game, you want them to make the best game they can make.    \n&nbsp;    \nThey are very open, more so than any other dev about what they are working on and new things they are trying.  Every week the put out a 30-60 min video showing off production, and then a 60min twitch stream with devs answering backers questions about the game, as well as 15-30mins video about either a bug in the game they fixed or video about the lore of the game.  Just yesterday they actually put out 90min interview with the dev heads about various things on the game, and not fluff, but the things the backers want to know about.  And you can even see in their answers how passionate they are about the game, and how much they care about the community.    \n&nbsp;    \nI just realized I typed all this when I could just linked this article below that came out today that does a decent job at sort of explaining it.    \n&nbsp;    \n[The merits of Star Citizen's development openness](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-14-the-merits-of-star-citizens-development-openness) "], [2, "From the Kickstarter phase late 2012, I didn't know about it this. It was only until December 2015 I heard about the game. \n\nIt's going to be a long post, and help see what their community is looking at. It's important not to see this as \"a Star Citizen backer being overly defensive\", I think people are smarter than that. I'm here for friendly discussion and fact checks. \n\nFrom investment standpoint, people would scratch their heads, this is way too risky, people are funding way too much for no guarantee. Surely the skepticism is very much valid. If you didn't follow he development cycle closely or researched what actually happened. \n\nBefore the Kickstarter, in 2011, CIG was established by Chris Roberts who had some success in the 90s with story-oriented space games. A lot of people in their 30s and early 40s remember that, in America and Europe. Now I have no idea how the project got that big in this fact alone, but it did. Average Yearly funding exceeds to 30 million dollars. But the fact is, they had no idea they would attract this much people and money. I think we all can agree on that part. Even CIG. So if you look at that and Chris Roberts, we know that the initial project goal and what the scope was going to be is no where near at the point that it is in now.\n\nIt is now exceeding $128 million, and outsiders would say, how much more are they trying to milk? Pointing at the company. But it's a work by both sides, the company and the community there. They actually support the game that much, and are willing to donate. It's not in a sense of buying the stuff from the game, it is, in actuality, a whole lot of donations. People are feeding the dream they share, and outsiders would call it crazy, which is also understandable. No one is really wrong, just a matter of passion and trust. \n\nSo with all the money, they *gradually grew* the team. If you look at the facts, the team was merely about 30 to 40 people. It's easy to say, \"the game had been in development for too long\" but when you look at how it came about, it's totally understandable. They didn't have 380+ project team from the start, not to mention the pace at which they progress towards completing the technology and features is incomparable, even that of 2 years ago and right now. They grew very big now. I think that's what people who say it's taking long are not taking into account, and blindly say it's never going to finish. \n\nHonestly, with the number of people they had, the progress they made in mere 4 years is astonishing. That is the perspective of a person who followed for a year and researched. Rather than embracing the negative drama and not looking for the details. \n\n\nSome people would call the community a literal cult, and some small group of people's actions can probably feed that idea. Chances are, when there a huge group of people, you'll see some idiots. In reality, people are sharing their goals and are working towards it, be it $20 or $45 donations (which is what majority of people who back the game are stopping at), or be it the notorious $15,000 donation (which is the amount only a handful of people have donated). It's a little frustrating when people point to that package and say \"are all star citizen backers paying that much??\" when in reality vast majority of people backed with little money. We all know it's crazy how big it's gotten. It's crazy how passionate *some* people are. \n\nYou could call a lot of those \"red flags\" but when you actually look what happened, they aren't quite true or even irrelevant (and some of them are actually straight false.). \n\nThe Kotaku article you linked is actually one of the better articles from them, although they are pretty shitty often. What they did was looking at how the project was a bumpy ride. Not that much else, but it does give us he perspective of some people who were in the close relations or were part of the project. Now, projects in this scale really cannot possibly go perfectly from start to end, and what you get out of the article is up to you. I think it was a good read. \n"], [2, "Just copying over my other post from the PC Games thread\n\n>It has micro transactions in a near full priced game.\n\nWhich are used to fund the development of the game.

If you want to compete in combat, those super expensive ships aren't going to be what you want. Every ship has advantages and disadvantages. \n\n>Its moving along very slowly, and by all means isnt managed very well.\n\nIt was moving along very slowly. They had to build an entire company from scratch and hire a bunch of people. Some managements errors were made like starting in Austin which didn't have much in the way of Cryengine experience. Since they've restructured the company the pace of development has easily tripled and probably higher. \n\n>No refunds for pre-orders \n\nI don't see the problem, kickstarters are a risk. I fully accepted that I may not get exactly what I want or nothing at all, it's why I only donated a little bit and not a ton as I'm not particularly rich. \n\n>They got crowdfunded instead of getting investors.\n\nI don't see how this is inherently bad? Both have pros and cons. \n\n>The company does not have a reputation matching the scope of the game\n\nBecause it's a new company specifically created to make this game? They have hired the talent necessary to do what they need to do now. CIG picking up the guys who basically made Cryengine really let them take off once they restructured. \n\n>It has continued to barrel off schedule\n\nNot without reason. Game development is volatile, and delays are far more common than you realize. I can think of at least a dozen games off the top of my head that took 5+ years, and pretty much all of them didn't start a 6 man company from scratch to do it.\n\n>The atmosphere surrounding it seems to be filled with gold medal mental gymnastics from faithful fans anytime any potential flaws are discussed despite it being completely unfinished with little complaint.\n\nFor starters, that's not even remotely relevant as a sign, literally every fan base ever has retarded fans who defend everything and honestly I rarely see any mental gymnastics (it really is over exaggerated). Well done criticism is generally take really well. That article you linked as an example? 1800 upvotes at 85% upvote ratio. \n\n\nStar Citizen has support because most of those \"red flags\" aren't actually all that red. "], [2, "For sake of fairness, I pledged quite a bit to SC, and would consider myself a fan of the project, but here would be my responses to these arguments:\n\n* I wouldn't call them micro-transactions, as they are honestly quite like any crowdfunding effort rewards players. Support more, get more. Plus, you won't be buying ships in game with real money when it comes out, as they've stated many times.\n\n* It does have expensive packages, as it gives an opportunity to the wealthier fans to support the game with large sums of money that doesn't equate to getting dozens (or hundreds) of smaller ships you could never make use of. As for advantages, the largest ship I would ever recommend flying yourself can be bought for ~$100, beyond that, any ship you get will be something where you have a crew running it, and those massive ships, the ones being bought for thousands of dollars are likely to be used by a guild. Keep in mind these are all things you should be able to afford in the game without having to devote your entire life to it.\n\n* The game is far beyond it's original target release date, but they've also added a ton to the scope of the game. As a fan, I'm actually really glad they did this, as there was quite simply NO way to release a quality product with all of the stretch goals in the original timeline. If someone said they could whip me up a 5 minute burger, but then I asked them to add dozens more ingredients, I wouldn't expect the burger to still come in 5 minutes.\n\n* There are refunds, many people have gotten refunds, not sure where you got this idea.\n\n* Why is it a red flag that it was crowdfunded? Just because some crowdfunded games flopped? If anything, the fact that they have millions of dollars to spend on the game with NO financial obligations to investors would be a good thing, not a bad thing. There is no group of people sitting back and asking them to cut corners here or try and scam out money there.\n\n* This is their first game, so of course they don't have a reputation \"matching the scope of the game.\" But what they do have is the guy behind some of the greatest space games of all time running the show, and if what we've seen so far is any indication, a team of incredibly talented and skilled developers and artists working to make this game happen. \n\n* I think I addressed the \"off schedule\" portion above.\n\n* Perhaps it's just from being on this side of the fence, but I haven't seen anything I would call \"gold medal mental gymnastics.\" It's also possible I just discuss the game with likeminded people who like the idea, had the money to throw at it, and are now sitting back and watching what unfolds. No one in my SC related group chat is freaking out (in a good or bad way) when anything big happens, we're just kind of observing. It's possible this isn't the norm, I tend not to associate with the kinds of people who can't keep their cool.\n\nNow for my two cents on Star Citizen. I truly do believe this is the game Chris Roberts has wanted to make for decades, and with the current technology at hand, he has the opportunity. He re-entered into the gaming world at a time when the idea of making a space simulator game was laughable (and he was laughed at) and was told no one would want to buy that game. The numbers told a different story. Last I checked the average backer had pledged something like $70 USD, which, yes, is more than the average AAA game, but I think that goes to show how interested in this people are. \n\nThey've been nothing but open and forthcoming with their fans, with thousands of hours of developer commentary/interviews/tech demos/etc detailing the progress the game is making. If Star Citizen is the massive scam so many people thought it was, they're making it extremely elaborate.\n\nAs for me? I'm just waiting to see what comes, as I already think I've gotten my money's worth. Between the playtime in the parts of the game currently usable, the physical swag I've received, the video content I've enjoyed, and most importantly, the friendships I've made through the community, Star Citizen has already had a massively positive impact on my life. If Chris Roberts cut and run with the remaining money tomorrow, I would be disappointed, but I would have no regrets.

Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2, and Divinity Original Sin 1 & 2 are all great examples of how crowd funding makes it possible for studios to fund their fantastic games that normally scare publishers away these days. It has become increasingly difficult for studios to fund large-scale games that don't follow industry trends and appeal to the largest possible audience because publishers aren't willing to take any kind of real risks when they fund a project. Games like Dragon Age: Origins or the original BioShock were some of the last few outliers that publishes actually took risks on.\n\nThe same could be said about Early Access, but I think that whole system is far easier to abuse. One good game that was in Early Access for a while and actually got finished is Assault Android Cactus. It's a solid game through and through, and it was developed by like two passionate dudes with very little resources, but they took the EA model and used it appropriately and were able to finish the game and provide their playerbase with the product they promised.\n\nBut pre-ordering doesn't make much sense.

You can buy an Aurora ship that gets you the full package for $45. Meanwhile, actual \"full priced games\" like the recent Mafia 3 is selling for $60+ (LOL)\n\n*\"It has expensive preorder package bonuses which may possibly give large advantages to players for pre-ordering with an extremely high upper limit (some packages in the thousands).\"*\n\nMay possibly.. so in this comment itself you proclaim something you're not even sure is the truth or you don't know that it will manifest into what you claim.. Great. \n\nAnything that can be pledged for now can be obtained in the game by playing. In order to operate the larger ships, you still need to have NPC or real players man them for you.. you can't do this, without paying them.. without having in game currency which you're earning, you cannot afford to do this, so really having these ships at the start of the PU will be largely pointless until you can get them operational, which will take time. \n\n*\"Its moving along very slowly, and by all means isnt managed very well (link to investigative article on this).\"*\n\nAgain with the \"its taking forever and may never release\" comment. Its been actively in development for 3 years now. They've ramped up their studios from 1 studio of 30 people to numerous studios of hundreds of people. That takes time and money to do, you don't just snap your fingers and it happens. \nThey've also had to heavily modify and rework large parts of the Crytek engine to achieve what they are striving for and model a silly amount of ships, environments and vehicles, nevermind all the meshing and artwork and systems and and and.

Smaller obligation? i'd say that have an even bigger obligation frankly.. AAA games are coming out which people are preordering and being disappointed by left right and center, and what do these developers and publishers do to make it right? Add more DLC?\nAt least with CIG they have been open and transparent the ENTIRE WAY. You can see weekly what these guys are working on and are being accountable to all the people who have backed all the way through. So many people are invested in this game openly that they have more eyes on them than most companies. \n\n*\"They got crowdfunded instead of getting investors.\"*\n\nI fail to see how this is a bad thing.. this leaves them in complete control of the game they make without anyone telling them or forcing them to go one way or another. This IMO is smart, like a music artist running their own label. they get to choose how the album sounds, what the artwork looks like, where and how its sold, the price its sold for.. \n\n*\"The company does not have a reputation matching the scope of the game.\"*\n\nThis doesn't even mean anything frankly. Now you need a certain reputation in order to be able to scope out how ambitious your game is? Honestly, this is just a filler comment that is meaningless. \n\n\n*\"It has continued to barrel off schedule\"*\n\nI'm willing to bet if I asked you now what their \"original\" schedule was, you'd have absolutely no idea. \nThey have added to the scope a lot as their kickstarter money has grown. As they've grown in investment, so has the ability to add more to the game. \nWhy wouldn't it? If they didn't add more to the scope, people would be sitting there accusing CIG of pocketing all this cash instead of putting it in the game \"like they should be with kickstarter money\". Now when they do just that, people complain that the schedule is changing.. well, you can't have it both ways. \n\n\n*\"The atmosphere surrounding it seems to be filled with gold medal mental gymnastics from faithful fans anytime any potential flaws are discussed despite it being completely unfinished with little complaint.\"*\n\nI have no problem accepting and discussing valid complaints with this game and its development or the faith in CIG as a developer. That is all up for debate and discussion. Unfortunately what was presented in this OP is largely bunk, which I have debunked much of (see above). \nStatements like \"Completely unfinished\" is where posts like this lose all credibility, because the fact is that a lot of the game is already finished or close to being finished. Just because you don't see it yet and can't experience it yet doesn't mean that it isn't the case. \n\nObviously people have this idea that CIG should finish modules and just hand them out for us to play.. well, this idea is flawed and clearly people must be thinking that because they haven't done this, that the game is unfinished, that they will never finish it, that they are scamming us etc. \n\nI'd like to remind everyone to just take a breath, do some meditation, maybe take a nice long walk, and realize that not everything can give you instant gratification. This is the most ambitious game ever built on PC.. YES IT IS. What they have already achieved and demoed is extremely impressive, and they are breaking boundaries with what they are building. If you don't have the stomach or the patience to see it through, that is totally fine and understandable. \n\nBut for the love of all that is holy, please stop filling the internet with made up facts and illusions as to what is right and wrong, what is working or broken, especially when you speak about this game out of ignorance. \nDo your research and come to the community with genuine, honest and knowledgeable discussion points.. in other words, the opposite of this OP. \n"], [1, "The fact that it's crowd funded instead of being backed by investors is what makes it so appealing to some.

I myself have had that same fantasy completely independently. combine that shared experience of a dream with a charismatic leader that promises the fulfillment of that dream, and you have a recipe for intense emotional reinforcement to the point of hallucination of the potential for this game.  If industry investors haven't touched this project, it is for a damn good reason.\n\nRoberts and the development people behind this game are probably mostly genuine honest decent people, and that is why you will continue to see content production; they aren't going to simply walk away with anyone's money without obligating their rationalization for the income: lets make content and produce models and write the game structure and push further.  The fact is patrons don't want to see a finished game as much as they THINK they do at this point; I think they want to see concept get pushed further the promises to be more dazzling and the pitch of an organic government/society/economy system to be more analog and as irreducibly complex as they can personally imagine. Like real life but without pesky general relativity and mortality and the lack of advancement of technology, all the great parts about reality with just enough painful realism and sensuality to fool themselves that they are out there in space.  However it is a safe bet to say NO video game going to be that good, because that is not what a video game is.\n\nThe real star citizens experience is already achieved, where everyone shares in believing in the prospect of the ultimate game that can deliver all things.  As soon as this game comes out, if it does, and can be critically evaluated by someone without personal emotional investment, it will just be another game and likely not a particularly fantastic one.  What will be fantastic will be the dedication its fans and players have for role-playing and projecting their own imagination onto the platform.  Flaws in the commercially released game will be skimmed over and forgiven by these people who have thus far been TRAINED to not only expect and forgive shortcomings but to feel like their faithful leader will hear their calls for improvement, making their personal fantasy an active element in the game's never-to-be-seen fulfillment.  Patrons have played an unhealthy level of participation in the game's development.  Games in their current manifestation are works of art and constructive creativity on the part of skilled individuals.  If there will ever be any aspect of 'games' that exists where the player is the creator or that their individual demands or interests are looked after by the merit of their participation, it seizes to be art and simply becomes life.  We already have fantasy structures in life where we participate in the structure in a way that specifically caters to our direct personal interests.  Everything from religion to going out to a bar to socializing at work to going onto facebook etc contribute to personal yet universal fantasies of individuality that mitigate reality qualities of reality in a way where we are indulged in the fashion that video games can indulge us.  but that is where the similarity ends.  Is Facebook a video game? does it not have a structure and an organic nature and controlled release of reality-like elements that change to the demands of the user, and you communicate to each other in various ways, and you see each other and exist in a modular universe where people have their personal touch on a virtual layout of blue and white designed in a certain way to be conducive to collective contribution all the while really being a platform that is fantastical and doesnt actually simulate nor contribute to the whole experience of being alive(like breathing, shitting, going to work, sleeping, eating, etc.)? Yes to all.  Now if execs now redesigned facebook where everyone simply had virtual avatars and the virtual design of facebook became 3 dimensional, would it become a video game? hell no.

I want to see this game work.  But I am also a professional project manager and what SC is trying to do isn't possible in the timeline he laid out.\n\nNow, to be fair, it will be possible over time.  People have to start being truthful with themselves.  Whatever CIG releases as the persistent universe in version 1.0 will be far removed from the demos and scripted events that he has been showcasing.  Will it contain some of that? Yeah, it will.

Let's be truthful, selling ships NOW is a power advantage.  Of course it is!  Can we stop pretending its not?   I'm not saying that's wrong or bad or illegal or anything like that.  But let's call a spade a spade.  Buying a super star destroyer for real world cash (even in development) is a power advantage for that player when they finally get into the game (and don't have to earn it).

The crazy thing is that it was probably a success BECAUSE it was not an open creation.  Everything you said is objectively unrealistic and clogged with emotional investment in this game!", "id": "d8su1g9"}, {"comment": "They're ways to donate, again, they're expensive because they're donations, not micro transactions.\n\nThats not development cost, it hasn't used that much money, it's how much they raised, not how much they've spent.\n\nI don't consider a game a success when it sold a bunch. And how many of those games were later refunded? Half would be forgiving. Valve had to put a special notice on the page explaining their refund policy so many people wanted one. It's an abysmal failure.\n\nEntitled no. But CIG still allows you. Not entitled/=/ not allowed. You can get a full refund.\n\n\nYoure proving my point for me, they would want a quick and easy cash-in, something star citizen isn't, at least without cutting corners and releasing unfinished. On the other hand fans don't care about timetables, they want a good game, and are willing to be patient for it. Also CIG wants input from the fans, they want to make a game that the fans want. Investors only want what can get them the most money back, fans be damned.\n\nHave you seen their videos? Maybe you should watch a couple of them. Maybe also play the alpha during the free weekends (and weeks) they regularly offer. just be sure to own a decent PC, it's a hard game to run, and is currently not very optimized. Also I'm going to need a source because I have never seen such open development from any developer on either side of the field. while it's initial success may have been due to no open development, nowadays it's one of their focal points. Want to see what they're working on for the next major patch? Check their YouTube and they explain it. It's a good way to show where the money is going (kind of like investor meetings) rather than keeping quiet like NMS.", "id": "d8szgjn"}, {"comment": "I was talking specifically about microtransactions.  please refer to context\n\nIf it isnt development cost, then what do you think you are donating to? YOU are proving MY point, where either it is the production cost or it is not being spent on production.  The latter is something that would have to be rationalized by RETROACTIVE logic, not the kind that would actually convince me to put money into a producer's pocket.  But im not saying that a good rationale for misappropriation of intended funds isnt possible, Im saying that rationale is not appropriate for the act of donating IRL.  SC team would have to be a bunch of REAL GREEDY 1%ERS to not spend every dime they could on production.  Oh, they aren't? well then, i was right.  They are decent, moral and professional people who have a production cost is the size of the donations they receive. period.\n\nagain, you have made a category error with the refunds.  I have not.  you can, in fact, get a full refund ***with considerable restrictions on the meaning of that statement.  and what power you DO have to get your money back will be fought by the fact that you will not have the right to get your money back by the time you have enough information to make a critical evaluation of the product you have help funded, e.g. when the game is launched.  Maybe it's great! but Im not going to invest my money into a game that hasn't been market-adjusted.\n\nYou are romanticizing crowdfunding as a solution to problems you are blowing out of proportion caused by greed.  expectations for such a game as SC can ONLY be had in a capitalist environment in which those expectations have been made more likely and more traditional, such as highly educated programmers and digital art professionals, high-speed internet and capacious mmo servers, mathematics and comp logic innovations made by fat cat corporations, hardware manufacturers that only make better stuff because of venture capitalism and investment in new tech and R&D.  There is NOTHING easy and quick as the investment process in entertainment or art, and im sure you would know that if you were not selfish and selfabsorbed in your consumption of such media.  everything that know that makes games great and entertaining, in all their successes and failures, are singularly driven by the intellectual and critical advancement of economics brought about by capitalist ventures.\n\nas for the last point, only a complete lack of skepticism could allow the admission half references to a game that doesnt actually exist.  I have seen their videos, and I am still unconvinced although I respect their passion and motivation.  if you personally disliked nomansky, well then that's fine and you probably share that dislike with many other people.  But again, you are conflating the worst possible examples of gaming history with a system that has arguably created the GREATEST VIDEOGAMES in history, and everywhere inbetween.  Don't be a fool and advocate something that you don't need to.  You don't have to convince me that the idea of SC is an impressive and imaginative and stimulating one.  I have dreamed and fantasized about just such a game countless times... especially one that i can continue to expand with no end in sight, not unlike SC.  But no game is ever as good as the ecstasy you project on it, and a game's capacity to elicit that fantasy lies only in its EXISTENCE and ACHIEVEMENT to do so.", "id": "d8twmmm"}, {"comment": "Those aren't micro transactions, that's the point I was making. I know how the business strategy works. And that's not what CIG is offering. If it was in the final game, then yes, but currently it's donation money.\n\n120 million is money they've raised, not the money they've spent. Just because they haven't spent it yet for development doesn't mean they won't ever. They currently have the resources equivalent to some of the most expensive games ever, not the development cost (yet anyway). It's money in the bank for continued development, server upkeep, merchandise, hiring A list voice actors, etc.\n\nI've seen dozens of people refund, with a 100% success rate. Either their PC can't run it, they get impatient, they lose faith in the game, they need the money for something else, whatever reason they want.\n\nI wouldn't call it greed, any reasonable professional investor would want their cash back and then some in a reasonable amount of time. Star citizen can't deliver that without cutting corners to shorten the release date (heck we don't know when it will even reach beta), which would hamper sales, so it's not a wise investment. I never said investment was a quick and painless process, however it's almost assuredly faster than the possible decade of development star citizen will go under. also what's with the hostility? I get it you dislike the game and the company, calm down. And what's up with the capitalist rant? Yes capitalism is good and makes things we all like. I'm not sure how that applies to a company asking for donations from people instead of investors.\n\nIt exists. You can go play it right now. It's still being worked on, but it's a functioning thing that does exist. Try it out on one of their free fly weeks, there should be another one coming up soon. I still can't think of any other developer who has been this open about their game, and I'm not exactly new to the gaming scene. They have something I haven't seen in a developer for a long time, and that's passion for what they are working on. Where they put the game ahead of monetary gains. Most of the greatest games in history were created by indie developers who had a passion for what they created. And almost everything they've talked about putting into the game is there, the big stuff anyway. A PU, a good/bad system. Multi crew ships, and soon to be cargo, pirating, and planetary landing with procedural generation, among others (they had a live demo at gamescom and citizencon showing it all off, check those out on YouTube). Once the core features are in it's a matter of getting all the other things like finishing the remaining ships, bug fixing, finishing up smaller features (like grabbing tools and cranes for large crates, jump point sizes, customizing ship loadout and paint job, etc) and (probably the hardest part) creating a full blown \"universe\" and a server than can support it and a bunch of players. it's not an easy game to make, but if anyone can do it it's these guys. they have the resources, they have the talent, and they have the passion.", "id": "d8tydhj"}, {"comment": "the point that I was making is that it that you were talking about microtransactions period. period.\n\nthey've raised almost $130 million, and they still haven't closed funding yet.  These things that you are saying that could be spent on with \"money in the bank\" are so much part of a production budget and more supplemented by actual revenue in most games, and therefore only further proves my point that it is highly presumptuous to take money and set it aside for non-production usage, and it also implies that the money over production budget is profit because it pads or precludes maintenance expenditures.  The capacity to pay for every aspect of running a business requires this thing called revenue, and revenue comes from the exchange of goods/services for money that covers costs of all kinds including personal pay.  The point is that you haven't paid for any actual thing in fact.  That means that the company is taking funding into revenue with no exchange of goods.  these things, \"merchandise, server upkeep, continued development\", are all things that are paid for by something called profit, which is revenue over costs, reinvested into things that are in demand which drives financial incentive.  So in the end, you need to return my last post and read it again as a response to this point once more.  Because you have now repeatedly overlooked and left unresponded the underpinning of my argument, which is that you do not use retroactive logic to explain your pledging into the game, you are only using it after the fact to explain why it is at least infinitesimally possible that you are not wrong to have put money into the game.  When you go to the bathroom in the morning, you don't decide to do it because you think it was probably the best thing to do at that time, rather it is the release of sympathetic stimulants and the increase of blood pressure and metabolic activation that causes you to instinctually get up and go to the bathroom.  When you decide to buy an ice cream on a hot day, you don't decide it is likely something that would cool you off, helping you save precious body water and electrolytes and dumping enkaphalins and insulin which will help you repair microinjuries, boost the immune system and help you store adipose tissue so you can survive the next winter or famine, rather you decide because it should feel good and be nostalgic or reinforce positive behavior or to help you socialize.  People dont believe in god or santa clause or in mass suicide or shitty consumer decisions because of the chances they have for being possibly not bad or even good, but rather because of completely unreasonable motivations.  Once the reason you MAKE decisions and the reasons your decisions are GOOD become one in the same, then you are making what is called LOGICAL decisions.\n\nFor this point, you need to yet again reread previous posts.  your difficulty of understanding is likely being caused by a blind spot which is in turn caused by magical or wishful thinking.  You did indeed claim that the reason that the crowdfunding and donation is better is because investment is greedy.  Obviously, now you are impulsively dropping back to a position of relative safety but you still aren't acknowledging the falsehood of your original point.  \"any reasonable professional investor would want their cash back and then some in a reasonable amount of time.\"  That time frame is exactly that, reasonable, and therefore entirely beholden to the reasoning of that individual venture.  it isnt exactly 2 months or exactly a decade, it is just whatever is a reasonable time frame.  Sometimes, reasonable time frames only exclude never or asymptotic to never.  Because every member of game production from investor to art design lackey share a similar line of reasoning, which is whatever is best for the business or art they contributing to, and what is best for the contribution itself.  and about capitalism: it isn't a rant, it was just a little education in case you didnt understand.  which even after reading, you still dont understand, so i'll just give you a definition:  capitalism is an economic model where private owners and investors control an industry (and get this right here) FOR PROFIT.  Your little spiel about how investment and corporate profit drive is greedy and hurts quality, and that donation is superior because it is specifically not that? well, there you go, cappy!\n\nwe'll skip the ad homs.  my arguments stand by themselves, and if they are wrong then i get to play the best game ever made for exactly whatever money it is worth, and i contributed to the criticism and pressure to make it happen.\n\nLastly, no it does not exist.  you are referring t o\"modules\" that exist completely separately and have thematically similar paint jobs, and yet still do not function as well as or in the way they are proposed to when the game is actually released does not constitute an existing game.  Hell, bringing these elements together is likely the most difficult part of the game:  have you ever created a fully and correctly working subprogram that is supposed to function in another program, only to have to scrap it or completely rewrite it because it wouldnt work or you needed a new method to make it work? happens ALL THE TIME when making new programs that do new things.  and by that very principle, you definitely cant \"count your chickens before they are  hatched\", or in this case \"count your game before it's launched\".  Then you start rambling things off that are supposed to be (virtually) represented in a game: multicrew ships, cargo, pirating, planetary landing, procedural generation, etc.  These are all arbitrarily chosen words to represent a series of functions that evoke subjective paradigms in the mind of the user. Pedantic, i know, but i have a point:  Whatever you see in the parts or paradigms of the game that are SECONDARILY and PARTIALLY represented by \"modules\", they are not actually in a full game that actually does these things.  The malfunction in those modules and their individual state of incompletion within them only reinforces my point.  Also, have you ever seen The Santa Clause, with Tim Allen? It convinces little children of the paradigm of the succession of santa clauses that are the real santa claus and have elves and flying reindeer in the same way that you are convinced by the demo at citizencon.  They even clearly state a few times and many other times imply that the entire gameplay you see is extremely limited and that many of the elements you see were produced specifically for that demo!  they say so many times that they WILL be able to do this and that, and it SHOULD have this and that in there, and that now that door works or now we have landing gear compression(whoopty doo), etc, and even mention that several things went wrong or offtrack from their scripted events, showing how narrow of a rail they were riding.  this is plainly not a game that exists, rather it is only INTENDED to exist in the future at some time.  \n\n\"it's not an easy game to make, but if anyone can do it it's these guys.  they have the resources, they have the talent, and they have the passion\" well, now you just told me the game doesnt exist.  But I hope they do have all these capacities.  still, i think i can tell you why you dont KNOW that they do: 1. the game doesn't exist, and they havent stopped taking donations, so they dont have the resources yet.  2. the game doesn't exist, so how would you know they have the talent(btw talent is a subjective term that is actually composed of passion, resources, circumstance and skill, nothing magical).  3. the game doesnt exist yet, and you cant be certain of the future existence of something that does not yet exist or has existed, and all things fade in time, and passion is no exception, and a lack of certainty can quickly erode passion, so what is to say that a lack of certainty that this game can even be completed and published won't destroy their passion to complete the project before before the project is completed?

This is their funding model - the game would not have been made without it. They have also stated that you will always be able to buy things with in game money once the game releases. The micro transactions are there to give people the option to support the development and get something for their support. \n> It has expensive preorder package bonuses which may possibly give large advantages to players for \npre-ordering with an extremely high upper limit (some packages in the thousands).\n\nLike I said, these are optional purchases to support the development of the game. Additionally, large ships aren't the \"end-all\" of the game. Just like in real life, larger more expensive ships are going to be more expensive to run in game, require more crew, and therefore have a much higher risk than smaller, less expensive ones. (Keep in mind all ships will be purchasable with in game money)\n>It's moving along very slowly, and by all means isnt managed very well (link to investigative article on this).\n\nI wouldn't consider it to be moving along slowly, (more on that later) but the management \"problems\" are something that occur across all game development, and there haven't been many significant issues/red flags. \n>No refunds for pre-orders (yes, its called backing, but to the end consumer, it amounts to the same thing except they have an even smaller obligation to deliver).\n\nHaving refunds on a crowd-funded game, (although nice for the consumer) would be a major headache for the developer. However, the lead developer has said >\u201cIf there are cases where people are really upset, or facing personal hardships, on a case by case basis we take a look and we refund,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep people around. We don\u2019t want to fight with them.\u201d\n>They got crowdfunded instead of getting investors\n\nThis is in my opinion a positive that sets out Star Citizen from something like CoD or NMS. Not having a publisher means no deadlines, no \"pressure to complete\" and lets Star Citizen focus on making the game not hitting deadlines.\n>The company does not have a reputation matching the scope of the game.\n\nand\n>It has continued to barrel off schedule\n\nI'm going to address these points together as they are somewhat related. When the original kickstarter was pitched, Star Citizen was planned at much smaller scope then what it is currently aiming for. Think medium indie game versus full AAA title. However, as they raised more and more money they continued to add features and increase the scale of the game until what it is now. Of course the company doesn't have a reputation - this is the first game that they've ever developed, and of course the game has gone of schedule it's much bigger and much more ambitious then it was 4 years ago. \n>The atmosphere surrounding it seems to be filled with gold medal mental gymnastics from faithful fans anytime any potential flaws are discussed despite it being completely unfinished with little complaint.\n\nThis is a valid concern, but something that has been getting better over the years. It's probably a combination of Buyer's Remorse and hype. When you spend thousands on a game, you're not going to like any criticism that comes your way. Star Citizen has made huge technological advancement however, something that should be applauded in this age of re skinning games every year to make a profit. \n\nOverall, I think Star Citizen is following a transparent development model. It means you get to see a lot of the cool stuff their working on but also see some of the mistakes they've made. The community interaction with the developers is great and how they let the backers provide feedback and support the game really makes me believe that it is headed in the right direction. There have been problems/miscommunications but that's to be expected of any game this scale. We shall see in the future what becomes of their business, and their game. \n", "id": "d8rtlgv"}], [{"comment": "Tons of valid comments here supporting Star Citizen, but no one is mentioning how incredibly open the communications are with the developers.

Investors can and will dictate game design and change things for the worse to maximize return. Crowdfunding gives the dev a chance to make the game they have always wanted to make (within budget). Seriously, how the hell is this a bad thing?", "id": "d8rvwuh"}, {"comment": "when a steam customer buys the finished game, and they like what they see, they keep the game and the money goes into the investors pockets.  The customer writes a review, or promotes the game in some similar fashion, and someone who likes the game's reputation then goes and checks the game out.  the more people are willing to pay for that enjoyment, more money goes to the investors.  Investors walk away with more knowledge about what makes a good game, and more money to put into a new game to produce that people will like.  I definitely understand what you mean in reference to backsliding on things and shortcutting quality etc. corporate commander and the whole shebang.  but you overestimate the extremity and importance of these problems and you romanticize the solution of crowdfunding.  The only reason games exist and are generally becoming better and meeting greater expectations and new markets is because of investment, financial incentive and the experimental organic process that is capitalism.  The potential and the very conception of such a game like SC only exists through the traditionalized expectations that only arise in a capitalist environment.\n\nWhy the hell is crowdfunding a bad thing? I dont think anyone is saying that crowdfunding is \"bad\".  but the reason why SC being crowdfunded is PART of a differential that foreshadows disappointment is because crowdfunding cannot guarantee an outcome beside the monetary changing of hands.  Only investment can guarantee more.  your statement that \"crowdfunding gives the dev a chance to make the game they always wanted to make...\" plainly shows your inability to see the chasm that lies below the tightrope of that potential.  There's a chance based purely on a dubious understood end product.  Also, the behavior of crowdfunding a game on the part of a developer pays for wages and a career or many, just like investments.  However, considering the psychological principle of positive reinforcement, the action promises the developer money is not a tangible game but rather a series of promises or ongoing unveilings of aspects of the proposed game in some completion.  Unfortunately, this process can be continued and perverted without the completion of star citizen.  That may be a little cynical, but it is a fact.  With partnerships and investments, a gamer almost always has the chance to know exactly what they are going to get because of the freedom of the press and that the product is finished beforehand.  The game was made for them, and if it sucks, they haven't necessarily paid for its production or wasted time hoping for its existence.  As with star citizen, compromises will be made, and Roberts cant deliver the world(which you are obviously already aware of).  So how do you know those compromises will be the ones that you would want? What if interest wanes, and he's way over budget and the pledges reach maximum potential?  What if the game simply isn't completed because of a lack of funds?  Sure, he wants to finish the game and he has money coming in, but how much of that money has he put into market research and projections for the future to prevent failure?  Roberts isnt obligated to finish the project like he would if he had investors who would want to recoup losses or make money.  anything could happen to roberts or the companies that underpin the project and things could simply fall apart.  a lack of infrastructure and assets or resources that would otherwise come from investor interest make the project more expensive and more of an uphill battle.  If EA or Microsoft decided to, they could have a very similar game up and in development at the best possible time and utterly crush star citizen from buyouts, publishing and intellectual rights, bottlenecking distribution or platform support, and hold that up to roberts and make him an offer he cant refuse; it would be just another day of business and you are out your game.  A small, shitty company made almost $80 million in a month from No Man's Sky, just from riding off inspiration and innovation from star citizen, not to mention the market that was assembled from anticipation for star citizen.  What if the game finally comes out, and against all odds it is literally everything it was promised to be, and yet it just wasnt worth the money you pledged or the time you wasted thinking about it and all your emotional investment?  \n\nin the end, you as a crowdfunder haven't created star citizen any more than I created MGSV, which is a game i fucking love and bought.  but it existed before i bought it, and it is a quirky, imperfect and yet passionately assembled work of fucking art.  Let objective investors do the research and the math to determine if a game will actually exist and succeed and have measurable quality, and then I will do my part in reciprocating the industry with patronage in the form of purchases and feedback and promotion of good games.", "id": "d8sv75b"}], [{"comment": "As someone who did back the game with no expectations that it would actually see it's way to a final release (especially on time) I should point out a few things.\n\nThe micro transactions and preorder packages...They're included at the moment for additional crowdfunding. The more money this game sees the more we can get out of it. From what I understand, the things we're paying for are going to be available in game with credits once the game releases. Sure the people who spent thousands before hand to get the best ships will have an advantage somewhat at release but I'm sure it'll even out over a short time. The high price tags are, again, for crowdfunding. I'd imagine some of the skins are going to continue as micro transactions though if I had to be logical based on what games are doing these days.\n\nI'd say being crowdfunded is a whole lot better for this situation because having a company back your game means you have to follow their rules and deadlines. Through crowdfunding, they get to take their time making the game they envision and the one we want. I also doubt any company would have given them $110 million dollars to fund it and likely would've forced this game to push an early release which would cause features to be cut and we'd just have another No Man's Sky. No Thanks.\n\nTrue, the company doesn't have a reputation as whole. If you don't feel comfortable with that then refusing to back it us your choice entirely.\n\nMoving along slow? It's been 5 years. Fallout 4 wasn't anything ground breaking and the engine was used on Skyrim yet still took 7 years. The difference being that we didn't hear about it until less than 2 years to release while we heard about Star Citizen the moment it was being funded. They've also had to take the time to basically create technology that hadn't been done yet in order to support the content they're creating which included modifying the game engine itself.\n\nAs far as going off schedule...yea that sucks. Anytime something you were hoping for gets delayed it definitely sucks. If the past has showed us anything though, choosing for something to be rushed rather than delayed ends up being no good.\n\nAnd trust me, I know there's a chance it would fail. I don't blame people for choosing not to backing it and I understand. I chose to back it because I want to see it finished and it helps that I actively get to test the progress and see how it's going.  This devs are constantly showing the new tech they're working on and it's beautiful. Even if the game doesn't hit it's full release, the technology they've been working can help put advancements in gaming and that along is something to look forward to.

This is something that is hard for many to see, because Cloud Imperium have given an unprecedented amount of insight into stages of development where many games *would not have been announced yet*, and definitely would not have released any significant details. They have a playable Alpha build which regularly gets updated with new content.

You are not pre-ordering it.*\n\nLike *any crowdfunded project*, there is no obligation to return your funds once you have committed them. And like any crowdfunded project, *it might not meet expectations*. Again, you are not obliged to have your funds returned if the project disappoints. That's how crowdfunding works. If you're not comfortable with that, don't participate in crowdfunding anything with significant uncertainty.\n\n> They got crowdfunded instead of getting investors.\n\nWhile I can appreciate that this is a 'red flag' in the sense that they don't have big money investors breathing down their necks demanding that they deliver, it's also a good thing, because they don't have big money investors breathing down their necks demanding that they deliver.\n\nCloud Imperium is developing some incredible technology for this game. Tech that I guarantee they would not be able to develop with a big money investor involved. This game's 'investors' don't have an expectation of monetary returns; they want a good game. Big money investors throw money at products wanting to get more money back. People throw money at Star Citizen wanting them to use that money to make a better game.\n\n> The company does not have a reputation matching the scope of the game.\n\nThe company has very little reputation, as *it's a new company.*\n\nOn the other hand, it's also managed by a man who - admittedly has his flaws - but has also delivered some very good games in this genre.\n\n> It has continued to barrel off schedule\n\nThe schedule got thrown out of the window once this went from a 'small' project (relative to most games) with a few million involved, to a massive project with $100m+ funding.

My only worry is that they will run out of money before the game is complete. Not that there is any indication of that \"yet\" but I think it's a valid concern. 126 million will only go so far but they are consistently adding more funds.

I don't think I'm a fanboy, I keep an open mind, this could all fail but I'm sure some will label me as such.    \n&nbsp;    \nThe part about \"delays\" just is not applicable at all.  The whole reason they did crowdfunding vs publisher/investors is that they can take the time to build the game they want to build!  They don't have to be rushed because the publisher needs sales this quarter or what not.  Sure they've thrown out some dates in the past and not met them but really they shouldn't have put it out there to begin with because they don't really apply.  They will certainly aim for things, but things change.  Originally procedural planets were not a thing at all, it was just going to be on-rails landing to very narrow pieces of a planet, but they put in the time and money into R&D and managed to make some very powerful tools that allow them way more real-estate than they originally thought and are now adjusting things to fit (by \"now\" I mean like the last year or so).    \n&nbsp;    \nA lot of people will jump to the \"it's been in development for 4yrs already!\" argument.  Which is true it did all start 4yrs ago but that is a bit skewed.  As soon as the kickstarter started they weren't programming day one.  They've spent the last 4 years not only developing two games (Star Citizen & Squadron 42) but also building a company and drastically modifying a game engine as well.  They've had to find offices, buy and build hardware, interview and hire people, train people in some sort of way, build new tools for the engine to allow them to do what they want to do.  All those things and \"normal\" game development things too.  You can look at GTA games, they take around 5yrs to make, but they already have the studio, hardware, software, people, engine in place from the beginning!  How do you think CoD and sports games games get churned out yearly?  They already have all these things in place when they start working on the game, not to mention much smaller in scope games, one could even say \"cookie cutter\" games.    \n&nbsp;    \nI'm not sure what \"reputation\" has to do with anything.  So if someone is not known for a thing they should never try to do that thing?  \"Hey Hyundai, you're only known for shipping, you can't build cars\" only (probably bad) example I could come up with on the spot.    \n&nbsp;    \nYou can't compare any of the items as \"pre-order\" that's really not a fair comparison and very Apples to Oranges.  You are *backing* the game, helping development of it, and for that yeah you get a copy of the game when it's out and some ships if you want.    You are not required to buy any of these, all the ships will be obtainable in-game when it launches.  For $60 you can \"back\" the game and get a copy of Star Citizen, Squadron 42, and a starter ship, that is the bare minimum anyone \"needs\" to purchase if they want to back it and play on day one.  I imagine later on when actual pre-orders begin the prices will go up to $60 each but that is just my guess.    \n&nbsp;    \nI realize I'm not addressing these in order at all.  I'm not sure what you mean by \"micro transactions\".  They haven't mentioned any of their launch/post-launch details for the game other to say that the \"buying\" of ships with real money will not continue when the game is live.  Anything you can buy now on their site is because you want to back the game, you want them to make the best game they can make.    \n&nbsp;    \nThey are very open, more so than any other dev about what they are working on and new things they are trying.

Just yesterday they actually put out 90min interview with the dev heads about various things on the game, and not fluff, but the things the backers want to know about.  And you can even see in their answers how passionate they are about the game, and how much they care about the community.    \n&nbsp;    \nI just realized I typed all this when I could just linked this article below that came out today that does a decent job at sort of explaining it.    \n&nbsp;    \n[The merits of Star Citizen's development openness](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-14-the-merits-of-star-citizens-development-openness) ", "id": "d8s3yxp"}], [{"comment": "From the Kickstarter phase late 2012, I didn't know about it this. It was only until December 2015 I heard about the game. \n\nIt's going to be a long post, and help see what their community is looking at. It's important not to see this as \"a Star Citizen backer being overly defensive\", I think people are smarter than that. I'm here for friendly discussion and fact checks. \n\nFrom investment standpoint, people would scratch their heads, this is way too risky, people are funding way too much for no guarantee. Surely the skepticism is very much valid. If you didn't follow he development cycle closely or researched what actually happened. \n\nBefore the Kickstarter, in 2011, CIG was established by Chris Roberts who had some success in the 90s with story-oriented space games. A lot of people in their 30s and early 40s remember that, in America and Europe. Now I have no idea how the project got that big in this fact alone, but it did. Average Yearly funding exceeds to 30 million dollars. But the fact is, they had no idea they would attract this much people and money. I think we all can agree on that part. Even CIG. So if you look at that and Chris Roberts, we know that the initial project goal and what the scope was going to be is no where near at the point that it is in now.\n\nIt is now exceeding $128 million, and outsiders would say, how much more are they trying to milk? Pointing at the company. But it's a work by both sides, the company and the community there. They actually support the game that much, and are willing to donate. It's not in a sense of buying the stuff from the game, it is, in actuality, a whole lot of donations. People are feeding the dream they share, and outsiders would call it crazy, which is also understandable. No one is really wrong, just a matter of passion and trust. \n\nSo with all the money, they *gradually grew* the team. If you look at the facts, the team was merely about 30 to 40 people. It's easy to say, \"the game had been in development for too long\" but when you look at how it came about, it's totally understandable. They didn't have 380+ project team from the start, not to mention the pace at which they progress towards completing the technology and features is incomparable, even that of 2 years ago and right now. They grew very big now. I think that's what people who say it's taking long are not taking into account, and blindly say it's never going to finish. \n\nHonestly, with the number of people they had, the progress they made in mere 4 years is astonishing. That is the perspective of a person who followed for a year and researched. Rather than embracing the negative drama and not looking for the details. \n\n\nSome people would call the community a literal cult, and some small group of people's actions can probably feed that idea. Chances are, when there a huge group of people, you'll see some idiots. In reality, people are sharing their goals and are working towards it, be it $20 or $45 donations (which is what majority of people who back the game are stopping at), or be it the notorious $15,000 donation (which is the amount only a handful of people have donated). It's a little frustrating when people point to that package and say \"are all star citizen backers paying that much??\" when in reality vast majority of people backed with little money. We all know it's crazy how big it's gotten. It's crazy how passionate *some* people are. \n\nYou could call a lot of those \"red flags\" but when you actually look what happened, they aren't quite true or even irrelevant (and some of them are actually straight false.). \n\nThe Kotaku article you linked is actually one of the better articles from them, although they are pretty shitty often. What they did was looking at how the project was a bumpy ride. Not that much else, but it does give us he perspective of some people who were in the close relations or were part of the project. Now, projects in this scale really cannot possibly go perfectly from start to end, and what you get out of the article is up to you. I think it was a good read. \n", "id": "d8s4gj5"}], [{"comment": "Just copying over my other post from the PC Games thread\n\n>It has micro transactions in a near full priced game.\n\nWhich are used to fund the development of the game. Anything that can be purchased with real money can be obtained in the game.\n\n>It has expensive preorder package bonuses which may possibly give large advantages to players for pre-ordering with an extremely high upper limit (some packages in the thousands).\n\nWelcome to crowdfunding, literally every crowdfunding project does this, and \"advantage\" in Star Citizen really depends on what you want to do. If you want to compete in combat, those super expensive ships aren't going to be what you want. Every ship has advantages and disadvantages. \n\n>Its moving along very slowly, and by all means isnt managed very well.\n\nIt was moving along very slowly. They had to build an entire company from scratch and hire a bunch of people. Some managements errors were made like starting in Austin which didn't have much in the way of Cryengine experience. Since they've restructured the company the pace of development has easily tripled and probably higher. \n\n>No refunds for pre-orders \n\nI don't see the problem, kickstarters are a risk. I fully accepted that I may not get exactly what I want or nothing at all, it's why I only donated a little bit and not a ton as I'm not particularly rich. \n\n>They got crowdfunded instead of getting investors.\n\nI don't see how this is inherently bad? Both have pros and cons. \n\n>The company does not have a reputation matching the scope of the game\n\nBecause it's a new company specifically created to make this game? They have hired the talent necessary to do what they need to do now. CIG picking up the guys who basically made Cryengine really let them take off once they restructured. \n\n>It has continued to barrel off schedule\n\nNot without reason. Game development is volatile, and delays are far more common than you realize. I can think of at least a dozen games off the top of my head that took 5+ years, and pretty much all of them didn't start a 6 man company from scratch to do it.\n\n>The atmosphere surrounding it seems to be filled with gold medal mental gymnastics from faithful fans anytime any potential flaws are discussed despite it being completely unfinished with little complaint.\n\nFor starters, that's not even remotely relevant as a sign, literally every fan base ever has retarded fans who defend everything and honestly I rarely see any mental gymnastics (it really is over exaggerated). Well done criticism is generally take really well. That article you linked as an example? 1800 upvotes at 85% upvote ratio. \n\n\nStar Citizen has support because most of those \"red flags\" aren't actually all that red. ", "id": "d8shcd7"}], [{"comment": "For sake of fairness, I pledged quite a bit to SC, and would consider myself a fan of the project, but here would be my responses to these arguments:\n\n* I wouldn't call them micro-transactions, as they are honestly quite like any crowdfunding effort rewards players. Support more, get more. Plus, you won't be buying ships in game with real money when it comes out, as they've stated many times.\n\n* It does have expensive packages, as it gives an opportunity to the wealthier fans to support the game with large sums of money that doesn't equate to getting dozens (or hundreds) of smaller ships you could never make use of. As for advantages, the largest ship I would ever recommend flying yourself can be bought for ~$100, beyond that, any ship you get will be something where you have a crew running it, and those massive ships, the ones being bought for thousands of dollars are likely to be used by a guild. Keep in mind these are all things you should be able to afford in the game without having to devote your entire life to it.\n\n* The game is far beyond it's original target release date, but they've also added a ton to the scope of the game. As a fan, I'm actually really glad they did this, as there was quite simply NO way to release a quality product with all of the stretch goals in the original timeline. If someone said they could whip me up a 5 minute burger, but then I asked them to add dozens more ingredients, I wouldn't expect the burger to still come in 5 minutes.\n\n* There are refunds, many people have gotten refunds, not sure where you got this idea.\n\n* Why is it a red flag that it was crowdfunded? Just because some crowdfunded games flopped? If anything, the fact that they have millions of dollars to spend on the game with NO financial obligations to investors would be a good thing, not a bad thing. There is no group of people sitting back and asking them to cut corners here or try and scam out money there.\n\n* This is their first game, so of course they don't have a reputation \"matching the scope of the game.\" But what they do have is the guy behind some of the greatest space games of all time running the show, and if what we've seen so far is any indication, a team of incredibly talented and skilled developers and artists working to make this game happen. \n\n* I think I addressed the \"off schedule\" portion above.\n\n* Perhaps it's just from being on this side of the fence, but I haven't seen anything I would call \"gold medal mental gymnastics.\" It's also possible I just discuss the game with likeminded people who like the idea, had the money to throw at it, and are now sitting back and watching what unfolds. No one in my SC related group chat is freaking out (in a good or bad way) when anything big happens, we're just kind of observing. It's possible this isn't the norm, I tend not to associate with the kinds of people who can't keep their cool.\n\nNow for my two cents on Star Citizen. I truly do believe this is the game Chris Roberts has wanted to make for decades, and with the current technology at hand, he has the opportunity. He re-entered into the gaming world at a time when the idea of making a space simulator game was laughable (and he was laughed at) and was told no one would want to buy that game. The numbers told a different story. Last I checked the average backer had pledged something like $70 USD, which, yes, is more than the average AAA game, but I think that goes to show how interested in this people are. \n\nThey've been nothing but open and forthcoming with their fans, with thousands of hours of developer commentary/interviews/tech demos/etc detailing the progress the game is making. If Star Citizen is the massive scam so many people thought it was, they're making it extremely elaborate.\n\nAs for me? I'm just waiting to see what comes, as I already think I've gotten my money's worth. Between the playtime in the parts of the game currently usable, the physical swag I've received, the video content I've enjoyed, and most importantly, the friendships I've made through the community, Star Citizen has already had a massively positive impact on my life. If Chris Roberts cut and run with the remaining money tomorrow, I would be disappointed, but I would have no regrets.

Flying right now is close to how you control an FPS game keybinding WASD. W forward acceleration. S for deceleration and back. S-D strafe. Q-E for roll. Space to \"jump\" or strafe up. CTRL to \"crouch\" or strafe down. Shift is your \"run\" or boost. Your mouse handles the Yaw/Pitch. If you hold down the ALT key + W or S, you do a more refined forward/reverse thruster movements.  \n\nIt won't be easy. It's like learning how to drive. You need to practice in Arena Commander>Free Flight Mode then the Arena Commander>Racing Mode first. When you're comfortable, then you go trying to fight some drones.

Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2, and Divinity Original Sin 1 & 2 are all great examples of how crowd funding makes it possible for studios to fund their fantastic games that normally scare publishers away these days. It has become increasingly difficult for studios to fund large-scale games that don't follow industry trends and appeal to the largest possible audience because publishers aren't willing to take any kind of real risks when they fund a project. Games like Dragon Age: Origins or the original BioShock were some of the last few outliers that publishes actually took risks on.\n\nThe same could be said about Early Access, but I think that whole system is far easier to abuse. One good game that was in Early Access for a while and actually got finished is Assault Android Cactus. It's a solid game through and through, and it was developed by like two passionate dudes with very little resources, but they took the EA model and used it appropriately and were able to finish the game and provide their playerbase with the product they promised.\n\nBut pre-ordering doesn't make much sense.

If they didn't add more to the scope, people would be sitting there accusing CIG of pocketing all this cash instead of putting it in the game \"like they should be with kickstarter money\".

That is all up for debate and discussion. Unfortunately what was presented in this OP is largely bunk, which I have debunked much of (see above). \nStatements like \"Completely unfinished\" is where posts like this lose all credibility, because the fact is that a lot of the game is already finished or close to being finished. Just because you don't see it yet and can't experience it yet doesn't mean that it isn't the case. \n\nObviously people have this idea that CIG should finish modules and just hand them out for us to play.. well, this idea is flawed and clearly people must be thinking that because they haven't done this, that the game is unfinished, that they will never finish it, that they are scamming us etc. \n\nI'd like to remind everyone to just take a breath, do some meditation, maybe take a nice long walk, and realize that not everything can give you instant gratification. This is the most ambitious game ever built on PC.. YES IT IS. What they have already achieved and demoed is extremely impressive, and they are breaking boundaries with what they are building.

I myself have had that same fantasy completely independently. combine that shared experience of a dream with a charismatic leader that promises the fulfillment of that dream, and you have a recipe for intense emotional reinforcement to the point of hallucination of the potential for this game.  If industry investors haven't touched this project, it is for a damn good reason.\n\nRoberts and the development people behind this game are probably mostly genuine honest decent people, and that is why you will continue to see content production; they aren't going to simply walk away with anyone's money without obligating their rationalization for the income: lets make content and produce models and write the game structure and push further.  The fact is patrons don't want to see a finished game as much as they THINK they do at this point; I think they want to see concept get pushed further the promises to be more dazzling and the pitch of an organic government/society/economy system to be more analog and as irreducibly complex as they can personally imagine. Like real life but without pesky general relativity and mortality and the lack of advancement of technology, all the great parts about reality with just enough painful realism and sensuality to fool themselves that they are out there in space.  However it is a safe bet to say NO video game going to be that good, because that is not what a video game is.\n\nThe real star citizens experience is already achieved, where everyone shares in believing in the prospect of the ultimate game that can deliver all things.  As soon as this game comes out, if it does, and can be critically evaluated by someone without personal emotional investment, it will just be another game and likely not a particularly fantastic one.  What will be fantastic will be the dedication its fans and players have for role-playing and projecting their own imagination onto the platform.  Flaws in the commercially released game will be skimmed over and forgiven by these people who have thus far been TRAINED to not only expect and forgive shortcomings but to feel like their faithful leader will hear their calls for improvement, making their personal fantasy an active element in the game's never-to-be-seen fulfillment.  Patrons have played an unhealthy level of participation in the game's development.  Games in their current manifestation are works of art and constructive creativity on the part of skilled individuals.  If there will ever be any aspect of 'games' that exists where the player is the creator or that their individual demands or interests are looked after by the merit of their participation, it seizes to be art and simply becomes life.  We already have fantasy structures in life where we participate in the structure in a way that specifically caters to our direct personal interests.  Everything from religion to going out to a bar to socializing at work to going onto facebook etc contribute to personal yet universal fantasies of individuality that mitigate reality qualities of reality in a way where we are indulged in the fashion that video games can indulge us.  but that is where the similarity ends.  Is Facebook a video game? does it not have a structure and an organic nature and controlled release of reality-like elements that change to the demands of the user, and you communicate to each other in various ways, and you see each other and exist in a modular universe where people have their personal touch on a virtual layout of blue and white designed in a certain way to be conducive to collective contribution all the while really being a platform that is fantastical and doesnt actually simulate nor contribute to the whole experience of being alive(like breathing, shitting, going to work, sleeping, eating, etc.)? Yes to all.  Now if execs now redesigned facebook where everyone simply had virtual avatars and the virtual design of facebook became 3 dimensional, would it become a video game? hell no.

I want to see this game work.  But I am also a professional project manager and what SC is trying to do isn't possible in the timeline he laid out.\n\nNow, to be fair, it will be possible over time.  People have to start being truthful with themselves.  Whatever CIG releases as the persistent universe in version 1.0 will be far removed from the demos and scripted events that he has been showcasing.  Will it contain some of that? Yeah, it will.

It is one that could literally change the genre and how games are developed.  But if people don't start thinking about it critically they will be in for a world of disappointment.  Roberts has a lot to prove.  His previous attempt at this was bought out and forced to completion because Roberts couldn't do it.  He wanted a game in perpetual development but that doesn't pay the bills.\n\nAs for the things listed above, yes, Roberts is getting a free pass on items that would normally get flagged in other development.  Let's be truthful, selling ships NOW is a power advantage.  Of course it is!  Can we stop pretending its not?   I'm not saying that's wrong or bad or illegal or anything like that.  But let's call a spade a spade.  Buying a super star destroyer for real world cash (even in development) is a power advantage for that player when they finally get into the game (and don't have to earn it).

The only thing that didn't go live last year was a canned Retaliator startup sequence (probably the least significant part of it) \n\nEverything you see is part of features being developed right now. Sure it's scripted for the demo, that's obvious, but you still have  \n\n-  Ship flight and systems\n-  the planets to that level of detail and whatnot\n-  Character level interaction ie get out of seat, walk around, interact, suit up from closet, open door etc\n-  ground vehicles as shown\n-  FPS combat as shown\n-  Character customization, armour, weapons, inventory  or whatever \n-  Ground AI combatants as shown (although they sucked AI wise)\n-  Weather systems that will be systematic. I don't see why they couldn't fit that dust storm into a systemic weather implementation. They've already done the hard part. This should come in early releases in some form.\n-  Wrecked ships. This isn't specific for scripted demos. They have ships with fully modelled interiors and damage shaders. They need to do more work and then embed them in terrain. Again, this is a feature that will be in the game, and we've already seen multiple wrecks. Find a blackbox in a wreck - normal fetch quest. This is something they're doing for lots of ships.\n-  Alien life. Again, I don't see why they can't implement this to some degree. The worm for example doesn't have to be complicated. Although I admit this stuff in particular is going to come much later on.\n\nTo me, the scripted elements were not what made the demo impressive. It's the layering of all the complex mechanics and simulation to allow for interesting and emergent gameplay to a higher extent than what I normally see, while still maintaining a very high quality level of quality. Forget about the sandworm, I didn't really take it into account because of its scripted nature, but I still found the demo very impressive and exciting because of what it means for future releases.\n\nOfcourse, whether CIG manage to get 3.0 out in a reasonable amount of time is another question.

As long as it's open source I don't care what it looks like. \n\nI, and many others want a system that is open source. And this is for many reasons, of which I'll name a few. \n\n- With open source you're able to know the code isn't spying on you. You're able to see if there are bugs in the code. You're able to fix code, add code etc. Probably not you personally, but other people of the community will and it benefits everyone. \n\nWith a closed system like Windows or Mac OS you have absolutely no way of knowing what is really going on and you have absolutely no way of changing the code. \n\n- If a Linux distro does something its users don't like; fork it. I bet lots of people realised the benefit of open source when the clusterfuck that is Windows 8 was released. No company can hold the code hostage. \n\n- Open source is more productive. The Linux kernel is probably the greatest software project there is. It runs on damn near anything, and because it's freely available anyone can use it for their project. Android exists because they could just take this powerful code, with no approval from anyone, and made the most successful mobile operating system ever. And since android (AOSP) is open source, Amazon could just pick up their code and made Fire OS. These inventions/tweaks can be made ad infinitum with open source. \nHad Linux not existed, neither would Android and many other important projects. \n\nThis is impossible with a closed system.

For many it's not about which system is \"better\". If you made a Linux distro that looked and behaved essentially the same as Windows 10, then that would be great for the people that prefer that system. As long as it's open source I don't care what it looks like. \n\nI, and many others want a system that is open source. And this is for many reasons, of which I'll name a few. \n\n- With open source you're able to know the code isn't spying on you. You're able to see if there are bugs in the code. You're able to fix code, add code etc. Probably not you personally, but other people of the community will and it benefits everyone. \n\nWith a closed system like Windows or Mac OS you have absolutely no way of knowing what is really going on and you have absolutely no way of changing the code. \n\n- If a Linux distro does something its users don't like; fork it. I bet lots of people realised the benefit of open source when the clusterfuck that is Windows 8 was released. No company can hold the code hostage. \n\n- Open source is more productive. The Linux kernel is probably the greatest software project there is. It runs on damn near anything, and because it's freely available anyone can use it for their project. Android exists because they could just take this powerful code, with no approval from anyone, and made the most successful mobile operating system ever. And since android (AOSP) is open source, Amazon could just pick up their code and made Fire OS. These inventions/tweaks can be made ad infinitum with open source. \nHad Linux not existed, neither would Android and many other important projects. \n\nThis is impossible with a closed system. Microsoft has complete control of their code. If you don't like the way their OS is headed, tough luck.

Guess that's a dickish thing. And that PhysX is backwards compatible because it's a software layer that works on a defined set of hardware which is fulfilled entirely by Nvidia's CUDA(Which surprise, surprise, is used for research)\n\nFurthermore, AMD was offered the rights to utilize the technology(after Nvidia completely fixed it to work on single GPU systems), but declined. \n\nhttp://www.bit-tech.net/bits/interviews/2010/01/06/interview-amd-on-game-development-and-dx11/1\n\nTessellation= Tossing on more polygons to make bad texture models look better.

It's a mess. You can literally mod it right now, without their own modding utilities, using a unpacking tool for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. That's a game from 2002. You can't turn off v-sync because the physics is tied to it and the performance is so tanked that it is literally bound to RAM speed.(Regardless of GPU loyalty) \n\nHairworks= Yes, this was quite a bit of bull. Having that much of a performance difference was a bit of a shock in such a well optimized game, however it was resolved quickly after the problem became that readily apparent. Hairworks however, maintains to be a feature of Nvidia cards.\n\nhttp://www.hardocp.com/article/2015/08/25/witcher_3_wild_hunt_gameplay_performance_review#.Vn-YF_krK0p\n\nAt 4:30 He talks about TressFx giving Nvidia problems and their ablitity to work and patch it, which intrestingly ignores AMD's ablitity to work up a patch after the Witcher(Albeit slower due to their patch schedule) \n\n\"Mantle and NVidia's resistence to help= Ironically Mantle was AMD's own graphics API. This would be like AMD helping nvidia build Gameworks. Speaks for itself really. Nvidia decided to fall back to daddy Microsoft to provide the next set of DX API because everyone would use that anyway. \n\nGPUOPEN= Fantastic, The parts that he happens to skim over there is that GPUOPEN is purely an SDK with all the junk AMD invested R&D money into instead of CPUs and GPUS, not support. You use GPUOPEN and you get the tools, some help documentation, and that's it. Gameworks provides the tools and the support for Devs(for free, plus a little kickback+promotional assistance) \n\nBetter Freesync because free!= Yeah, it is cheaper because it's becoming part of the VESA standard however the GPU overhead provided by not having that does leave a bit to be desired. Right now however Freesync is a clear victor in the Adaptive sync market. \n\nHonestly I'm kinda surprised that he didn't touch on the few times where nvidia \"fudged\" the numbers of their GPUs like on the 660ti or 970 where the VRAM fully utilizable (3.5GB out of 4 in the case of the 970). Their independent journalist's benchmarks weren't wrong, it still is a good card for the money but a few parts were disabled leading to the last .5GB running at a significantly slower speed to differentiate the 970 from the more expensive 980. \n\nThe real core reason as to why Nvidia can get away with stuff like this is because AMD has spent so much time floundering around with terrible losses in the CPU division and wasted time making APIs or 3D gimmicks that their chips had fallen behind Nvidia's for a solid 5-ish year span. Nvidia holds a tremendous market gap simply because they put out the better product for several years and now they've began to branch out into other areas. \n\nAMD needs to start playing on the offensive. Stop giving away all your patents for free. I'm a GNU guy, I love open source stuff, but for real you're not in a position to be philanthropic to the gaming community.

It would be a bold statement to suggest Microsoft were anything other than what I said given the scale of anti-competitive (ergo anti-consumer) activity they've been hauled through the courts over; Courts that have found against Microsoft.\n\nBut you're correct: there is nothing intrinsically wrong with an organisation making a profit; indeed, for some oragisations they are legally bound to maximize their efforts to make a profit.  Microsoft is one of the latter.  Yet as a consumer should I regulate my concern of entities renouned for anti-consumer practices?  Should I, as a consumer, be concerned when an entity renouned for anti-consumer practices behaves in an agressive manner?  (And Microsoft are pushing Windows 10 agressively.). Absolutely.

Microsoft certainly has conspired against both the Law and the consumer in the past, and the very recent past; Microsoft absolutely wants to be the dominant PC games publishing platform (as required to satisfy their investors).

All big companies like Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, ... have investors to satisfy and have at some point chosen the benefit of investors over the consumer's freedom/interests.\n\nShould we, as consumers, tolerate this? I don't think so either. There should be some kind of reaction against bad business practices. Heck, I've been against Win 10 ever since they started pushing it so hard purely out of principle that the auto-update system should not be used to install adware (GWX app) on your pc nor to automatically overhaul whole your OS.\n\nMy main reaction against OP however comes from the whole \"MS wants to screw over pc gamers and has been limiting older Windows versions from the start and wants to take over the gaming industry\" comment. Sure, they are trying to get a foothold on the pc as a gaming platform (and are not doing a very good job at it, judging by the state of the MS store at this point). After all, the majority of gaming pcs runs on their OS. But saying MS is intentionally limiting the performance on older OS installs takes things a bit too far. I mean, his whole argument he has is supported by one sentence \"Windows 10 runs better\" (and maybe a second point, but since he's not disclosed that one we can't really judge).

The OS contains a lot of codes and routines and is usually founded in the technology that is available at the time of development. You can't foresee where this is going to go and end up limited by this framework (the OS) at some point in the future regardless.\n\nThis is exactly why MS is using Win 10 from now on. They have evolved from a \"fixed OS with updates\" to a flexible updatable OS, not unlike Apple (not that I personally like Apple though :p ).\n\nSo now imagine in about 10 years there is a new API but it requires certain implementations on the base level of your OS. In the current state that would be nearly impossible: tons of people running different versions, updates, ... At no point can you as a software engineer make any assumptions about the state of the OS you're targeting the update to. Having all systems running the same core makes these kind of things much easier than they are now.\n\nAnd yes, MS is trying to get a foothold on the pc gaming market. Not unlike Origin, Uplay, GoG,... they have realised their is some potential for monetary gain there, which is why they have been restricting their titles to their own platform. The added benefit MS has though is that the majority of systems already runs some version of their OS making it possible to integrate some of the features they want to add. This isn't a crime nor a grey zone. They are offering people a certain application directly built-into the OS. But if you don't want to use it, you don't have to (a bit like IE). The forced upgrade isn't necessarily something I agree with, but if you really take the effort it's pretty easy to avoid actually (which I have been doing since the beginning).\n\nAnd the whole \"Windows 10 runs better\" argument you're trying to make in your original comment is flawed in one big way: most games still run on DX11, even on Windows 10.

I don't enjoy the online but that's cause I don't like most online shooters with the exception of the unique ones like Killing Floor, Depth, Natural Selection etc. \n\nThe CoDs are fine. I wouldn't ever call them good games, but they're fine, solid, decent, etc. They don't need to change really, advanced warfare was solid. BO3 was solid. The stories are all atrocious but the backdrops are fun. Zombies is solid, I think the problem most people have is it's been surpassed by other games in the genre and refuses to grow. \n\nI mean competitive shooters it obviously doesn't hold a candle to basically any PC shooter - we have too many, and most are either really unique and asymmetrical, or have established communities like CSGO or BF4,  and you can check the numbers and see nobody really plays the new CoDs even a month after release. Competitive shooters are tough on PC, look at Evolve, Titanfall, Battlefront, Hardline - granted, of those only Titanfall was good IMO, but they died, and very quickly. Because there's too many other games out there. \n\nCampaign wise, it has some fun parts but when games like Wolfenstein TNO release, going back to CoD just kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nWith regards to zombies, it's fun for a bit but I've got Killing Floor 1/2, and Vermintide which are both far better experiences. \n\nYour second point is totally contradictory, and I don't think you really get what people mean when they say it takes no skill, what they mean is it has a very low skill ceiling - in games like CS and Overwatch, you can play for a bit and be good enough to not get the shit kicked out of you, but you can play a lot and become incredible and learn crazy strategies and tactics you otherwise wouldn't know about, it's about learning and progressing. That isn't in CoD, the skill in CoD is twitch reaction, and the progression is in things like unlocking guns and killstreaks, not actual skill progression. As soon as you have that trigger reflex down, you're golden. And it's also a terrible game to relax with because it fuels ragequitting like no other game I know due to all the bullshit ways you can die. \n\nYour point about locking the remaster behind the new game is utter nonsense and the only one I can't address properly.  You have no clue if it's in a contract, and it's a terrible decision that is so fucking anti consumer it's worse than anything Ubisoft or EA have ever done. \n\nBut other than that I don't see a lot of hate for CoD anymore, it's more of just resigned apathy. They've become a joke, which is fine because we're all in on the joke, we make fun of it but we play it every year. During the horrendous storyline of black ops 3 I found myself laughing at how stupid it was, but I didn't hate it, it's a movie that's so bad it's good. It's entertaining, and I can shoot shit. \n\nBut I also don't think you should pretend it's anything more than it is. Which is some fairly shit stories with cool backdrops, a few high points, corridor shooting, and lackluster online that's meant to fuel addiction in teenagers. They are the lowest common denominator of a lot of decent game modes baked into one accessible version, with a popular name brand that can be mass sold to people who just play casually and don't wanna get too into the less well known game titles out there.

MLB The Show is one of my alltime favorite games and i've been playing it since 2008. around 2012 i started getting tired of it because it's stale. it's been the same game but with an updated roster and some new shiny graphics.

I don't enjoy the online but that's cause I don't like most online shooters with the exception of the unique ones like Killing Floor, Depth, Natural Selection etc. \n\nThe CoDs are fine. I wouldn't ever call them good games, but they're fine, solid, decent, etc. They don't need to change really, advanced warfare was solid. BO3 was solid. The stories are all atrocious but the backdrops are fun. Zombies is solid, I think the problem most people have is it's been surpassed by other games in the genre and refuses to grow. \n\nI mean competitive shooters it obviously doesn't hold a candle to basically any PC shooter - we have too many, and most are either really unique and asymmetrical, or have established communities like CSGO or BF4,  and you can check the numbers and see nobody really plays the new CoDs even a month after release. Competitive shooters are tough on PC, look at Evolve, Titanfall, Battlefront, Hardline - granted, of those only Titanfall was good IMO, but they died, and very quickly. Because there's too many other games out there. \n\nCampaign wise, it has some fun parts but when games like Wolfenstein TNO release, going back to CoD just kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nWith regards to zombies, it's fun for a bit but I've got Killing Floor 1/2, and Vermintide which are both far better experiences. \n\nYour second point is totally contradictory, and I don't think you really get what people mean when they say it takes no skill, what they mean is it has a very low skill ceiling - in games like CS and Overwatch, you can play for a bit and be good enough to not get the shit kicked out of you, but you can play a lot and become incredible and learn crazy strategies and tactics you otherwise wouldn't know about, it's about learning and progressing. That isn't in CoD, the skill in CoD is twitch reaction, and the progression is in things like unlocking guns and killstreaks, not actual skill progression. As soon as you have that trigger reflex down, you're golden. And it's also a terrible game to relax with because it fuels ragequitting like no other game I know due to all the bullshit ways you can die. \n\nYour point about locking the remaster behind the new game is utter nonsense and the only one I can't address properly.  You have no clue if it's in a contract, and it's a terrible decision that is so fucking anti consumer it's worse than anything Ubisoft or EA have ever done. \n\nBut other than that I don't see a lot of hate for CoD anymore, it's more of just resigned apathy. They've become a joke, which is fine because we're all in on the joke, we make fun of it but we play it every year. During the horrendous storyline of black ops 3 I found myself laughing at how stupid it was, but I didn't hate it, it's a movie that's so bad it's good. It's entertaining, and I can shoot shit. \n\nBut I also don't think you should pretend it's anything more than it is. Which is some fairly shit stories with cool backdrops, a few high points, corridor shooting, and lackluster online that's meant to fuel addiction in teenagers. They are the lowest common denominator of a lot of decent game modes baked into one accessible version, with a popular name brand that can be mass sold to people who just play casually and don't wanna get too into the less well known game titles out there.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "d789k7r"}, {"comment": "I think you were trying to make this \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af!  \n  Type it like this \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\_/\u00af  \n  ^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot, ^^visit ^^/r/ArmFixerBot ^^for ^^more ^^info!", "id": "d789kb7"}, {"comment": "Too bad the two bots don't spam each other back and forth", "id": "d78beci"}, {"comment": "It would help if bots didn't reply to usernames with \"bot\" in them.

People consider \"normal\" that you have to increase power limit beyond factory settings to get factory clock... nevermind that doing that on the 480 is probably major part of the reason why people got damaged computers right on the first day, if you HAD to increase power limit on all other cards, why you wouldn't do that on the 480 too? And who would have expected that a 6-pin power card actually draws 165W instead of 150W on stock settings?\n\nAlso, there is an issue that on Windows 7 manifests as driver crash, and on Windows 10 (and 8?) as \"Black Screen\", AMD said more than a year ago they were going to fix the \"Black Screen\" issue, but if you visit their forums you will find lots of people complaining of the issue, asking about the issue, and the old timers angry that they didn't even botehred to put it in the driver changelog \"known issues\" list.\n\nMy 380X Crimson drivers (the new AMD drivers made after Raja returned to AMD), didn't let me configure some stuff because I had \"multimonitor Genlock\" enabled, except I was using a single monitor, and \"Genlock\", from what I've heard, is a FirePro enterprise feature, not available at all on the 380X (or any other consumer card).\n\nThat bug is also quite old.\n\nThe default fan profile is terrible, the single time I forgot to use third-party fan softrware, the card in 10 minutes of gaming went all the way to 90somethingC and started to smell funny (PCB varnish I believe, it wasn't a \"burning\" smell), and made lots of coil noise... and the fans were still slow... while not much faster, still virtually inaudiable, was enough to make it drop to 50C...\n\n\n\nWhen I asked AMD for support, got no answer.\n\nWhen I asked on AMD forums for support, got accused of being nVidia employee/troll/shill\n\nWhen I asked on discord... I got banned. Twice (once when I asked about the throttling... some reasonable mod unbanned me, I asked later about Genlock bug, got banned again).\n\nI asked Sapphire if they had a new BIOS, or if they could help me figure the TDP limits of my BIOS, they kept replying with \"RMA\".\n\nAsked Sapphire, before card arrival, for the card size, they told me to just look on their site (that has the size wrong...), I tried to explain better, and got lots of nonsensical replies, I guess seemly from a chinese employee, then they started to ignore me (didn't even closed the ticket).\n\nMantle is currently buggy, despite being AMD own invention.\n\nVulkan has lower performance on AMD than on nVidia, despite being AMD invention too.\n\nFury people has been complainign about na issue (I forgot exactly what it was, since I don't own a Fury) for more than a year, AMD only aknowledged it after people kept reposting it on /r/AMD despite AMD employees repeteadly deleting threads about it.\n\nAMD employees and /r/AMD mods also delete every time someone ask about the bugs I mentioned on the 380X (the Genlock thing, black screen, and power throttling).\n\nAMD GPUs have super aggressive power saving, that make them misbehave on non-games, for example browsers flickering or rendering wrong, CAD rendering wrong and being stuttery (Evne the mouse cursor move slow on my 380X, when I look at Sapphire Trixx, the GPU is running on \"idle\" even at 100% usage...), disabling power saving, ULPC, and other power-related settings doesn't fix it.\n\nAMD drivers on Linux are just crap, the \"AMDGPU\" new drivers, are MUCH faster than the older drivers... yet still have only 30 or 40% of nVidia drivers on Linux, with some games you seeing the GeForce GTX960 going faster than the Fury Nano...", "id": "d4y6wuo"}, {"comment": "First of all, there is a huge improvement on the RX 480 power-efficency wise, you're getting R9 380 power consumption/price and R9 390 (in some cases 390x) performance, which is around 90 less watts.\n\nI have the R9 380 and had the same problem, that can be easily fixed by increasing power limit to +10% or +15% on MSI Afterburner/Radeon Settings.\n\nYou're right about the RX 480, but Nvidia aren't perfect either, they have the exact same problem on the GTX 960 so...\n\nI had those Black Screen issues, last time that happened to me was like 3 months ago, fixed by incrasing power limit.\n\nNot really aware the multimonitor Genlock bug.\n\nWhat R9 380X did you buy? Mine came with a great fan config, idles at around 40\u00b0 and goes up to 75\u00b0 max under load with fans being at 48%, my GPU is overclocked to 1050mhz.\n\nThat story about asking Sapphire sounds really weird, i asked to Sapphire support the same thing (if there's a new BIOS for my GPU) and they helped me all the way through, they even asked me if i needed help with anything else (fans, temperatures, etc) after that they told me to contact them for whatever issue i had, best customer support i've had.", "id": "d4y7adc"}, {"comment": "How you contacted them?\n\nI used https://support.sapphiretech.com\n\nIt was one of the weirdest support I ever saw (not the worst, but was VERY weird, it felt like as if Sapphire was a tiny company and had the CEO cousin doing support tickets or something like that).\n\n480 efficiency is entirely due to the improved factory process, not design, this is the problem... it won't scale to bigger GPUs properly.\n\nAlso, increasing power limit is ok how? On  the 480 increasing power limit actually damages your computer, and most software have warning dialog boxes about voiding warranty before you can edit power limit... You shouldn't consider the fact taht you need to raise power limit that the GPU works... it doesn't, it should work at 0% power limit.\n\nGTX 960 DIDN'T HAD THE SAME ISSUE!!! Go read more about it. Or see this: www.pcper.com/reviews/Graphics-Cards/Power-Consumption-Concerns-Radeon-RX-480/Evaluating-ASUS-GTX-960-Strix\n\nBlack Screen issues happen even with increased power limit depending on why it happens, for example I see it when I enter Shadow of Mordor in-game encyclopedia... it is just stupid that the driver crash when I look the in-game enciclopedia, it is not even a 3D-heavy scene.\n\nAs for the 380X I have, is a Sapphire Nitro 380X, factory clock is 1040mhz... theoretically, I rarely see it actually working at that clock.", "id": "d4y7ks7"}, {"comment": "Yeah, that's the site i used.\n\nYeah, which is still a efficency improvement, AMD has said before that they can't get their cards to be more efficent than what they are because that would make their cards not be so budget friendly, you're trading efficency for price, which is fair if you're on a budget.\n\nI never said a thing about increasing power limit of the 480, i don't know if that card has the same issue, i was talking about Tonga/Hawaii cards.\n\nMate, if you overclock your card (or even buy a factory overclocked card) you're increasing the power draw from the PCIE slot...\n\nI have a R9 380 (same architecture, fewer CU) at 1050mhz with power draw to +10%, never drops below 1050mhz\n", "id": "d4y7xct"}, {"comment": "The 380 stated TDP is 190W.\n\nThe 380X TDP... is ALSO 190W, while having double VRAM (that also need more power) and having about 15% larger amount of parts on the GPU chip powered at the same time.\n\nThis mean that if you upgraded your 380 1050mhz +10% (thus 209W TDP) to a 380X somehow at the same clock (mine is 1040mhz, so close), you would need, ignoring the VRAM, 240W, already going beyond the PCB limits (the 380X PCB has 2 6pin connector, thus it is 225W). If you don't ignore the VRAM, then you would end with something like 250 or 260W.\n\nExcept the TDP is the same... like I said, the 380X TDP is still 190W.\n\nThis mean that at default power limit, it is 36% short of what it needs.\n\nSince the slider only go up to \"+20%\", this means that even at +20%, it is still not enough.\n\nAnd I know you didn't said about increasing power limit on 480, what I am mentionign specifically is that on 380X, 390s, APUs, 370s, etc... you see lots of forum posts suggesting to just up the power limit...\n\nThen suddenly come the 480 that is different, and the power limit is already right up to the maximum of the PCI-e limits. (comapre to 190W TDP with +20%, that is the maximum slider position, it results in 228W, just slightly above PCI-e specs... the 480 had the 0% power limit already above PCI-e specs, and the maximum slider was 50%!)\n\nThe thing is, the 480 that in my opinion do it \"right\", in the sense the power limit is enough to not throttle, and the 380X that do it wrong.\n\nA \"correct\" 380X design, would been use 6+8 pin (not just 6+6) and have the 0% power limit be about 225W, and the maximum slider be 20%\n\nSimilarly the \"correct\" 480 design should been to use 1 8-pin connector, while keeping the current power limit (but distributing the power properly, 2/3 to the cable, and 1/3 to the slot, thus achieving maximum slot and cable usage when hitting the PCI-e maximum specs).", "id": "d4ycaf1"}, {"comment": "Double VRam? Does your R9 380X have 8GB? I mean, since my R9 380 has 4GB... doubt it. Also, the amount of VRam a GPU has doesn't increase power consumption.

I'm pretty certain that would help A LOT.", "id": "d4ycjdy"}, {"comment": "The reference 380 has 2GB :) That is what I meant.\n\nAnd my GPU is increased power limit by 20% all times, at 0% it is completely useless (it can't stay at 1040mhz even in light load applications... at 0% most games are completely unplayable).\n\nI asked Sapphire for information on what is the actual power limit of their 380X, but they refuse to reply.\n\nI am waiting to get a new PSU (to be sure it isn't a PSU issue), then I will see if I can mod the BIOS to allow +50% power limit to see if the throttling stops.", "id": "d4ys7pm"}, {"comment": "That's really weird, i'm guessing it's hit and miss with AMD then, my GPU personally works fine and the support has been great, wish you luck buddie !", "id": "d4yt725"}], [{"comment": "Probably no chance of that happening since it takes so much money.

Its hard for me to believe that you have somehow used a majority of the data just playing TF2 (or if you were seriously referring to tf) like you stated in your original post in addition to skyrim mods.

A few games still adhere to this standard in one way or another, but many western games swap X and O so X is confirm and O is cancel instead.

Agreed on most parts especially GPU/CPU balance, what you personally have, and bias. But no to the $50 thing. If someone is willing to wait a little longer, they can get something much better for an extra $50 sometimes. It doesn't hurt to ask if they're willing to push that.
