Urban and Suburbs wasn't even a thing back then. They were just past colonies for christ sakes.\n\nNot even that day london could remotely compare to the population density in today's US metros.  >_> \n\nP.s.  Look up James Madison Diary Entry on the Electoral College. And why the south had the 3/5th of a vote slave rule. I'll give you a hint, it involves the fact slaves couldn't vote and how there were more slaves than non slaves in the southern states. Aka. If they didn't do the 3/5th - the # of electors those states would be much less than their northern counter-parts.  \n\nIf the electoral college Wasn't based off 500k/per population, and instead by geography sure, than your argument could hold more water. But. There's a reason ppl say \"battleground states\" did the forefather's predict that as well :p?  Or \"Two-Facing/Flip-Flopping\" based on which state or demographic you're in? Or. How a huge majority of campaign dollars only goes into these battleground states. (Aka 7-8 states are the one's \"holding the country by the gonads\" - similar to your Anti Metro/Suburb proposal) unfortunately those ~400-500k people's votes - due to the electoral college are worth absolutely nothing. So I'd expect nothing short of 400-500k people out there protesting that their voice doesn't matter as much as the next guy. Reminder. Over Half the country still didn't even go out to vote this cycle. So. If you use that as a census. I stead of 500k, that could be well over a million ppl who couldn't stomache one or the other side via electoral process.\n\nIf you'd like to provide me/us proof on how the forefather's wanted it to work as you're proposing. Than by all means. Most elections - 5-8 states don't even get a single Event/Rally held there let alone any marketing dollars. \n\nMost Major cities/state capitols don't even have 20% of the state's populace in them. So, you'd still be forced to go out and garner non citi folk support to win states. \n\nIf We're a democracy. Every vote should be equal. We all pay the same* federal taxes. \n\n", "id": "da2jnqf"}, {"comment": "The electoral college wasn't created *just* because of the 3/5ths rule, there was much more involved in the compromise.\n\nSuburb and urban terms are more modern, yes, but there was still a great deal of what they describe.  Those who lived out in the country with little ties to the larger cities.\n\nAdditionally, the electoral college was a way to balance the needs of federalism in the US.  It gave some weight to the lower populated states and diluted a bit of that power from the higher population states because your electoral voters is based upon the number of senate and house representatives you have from your state.\n\nIt also had to do with the ability for information to get to the likely voters back then.  And while we certainly have more information at our fingertips, you would be hard pressed to claim that people are more *correctly* informed rather than inundated with false accusations/news or highly slanted news - to which there are plenty of examples today.\n\nIt won't matter if you go to a strait democratic election, you will always have states that get ignored.  What a strait democratic election **will** give you is further concentrate power into fewer states, mostly those on the coasts, because that's where the majority of the US population lives.\n\nThe number of times a candidate won the popular vote but not the electoral college is around 4-5, I cannot remember the exact number, and the margins of victory were only fractions of a percent.  I'm not as troubled by this as some, mostly because I feel that we aren't supposed to be a country that is blindly led by the majority.\n\nIf you really want to speak about suppressed votes or disenfranchised voters, why not speak about those states that institute an all-or-nothing electoral college, and not start pushing for them to go proportional?\n\nAlso, and you should know this if you've actually read anything by James Madison or the Federalist Papers, the United States is not a Democracy, we are a Democratic Republic, at least on the federal level.", "id": "da3ee67"}, {"comment": "Showing 500k from bing and others. /shrug.

The DNC has done at least two things that do have evidence to show they actually happened: They moved Caucus dates to give Hillary an advantage, and they conspired to prop up laughable Republican candidates (including Trump) so as to make the end election \"easier\" for them.

I think if you study how the American dollar works as the world reserve currency and why that allows America to hold such massive levels of debt without going bankrupt is actually a point of economics. A challenge to that by creating a competitor could only weaken it. It's not going to strengthen the dollar by giving nations more choices not to use it. I won't source you for this because it's a matter of you bothering to study economics and I don't think that any of this is in contention. If you care to know about it, you can learn it just like any science. \n\nIf I had to guess, I assume the conspiracy theories you are upset about are the following statements I made:\n\nMoney masters who have power to create money out of thin air.\n\nThe US government does not care about human rights.\n\nand, the US did not go into Libya to stop war crimes.\n\nFirst of all, the money masters printing money out of thin air is an over simplification of the global banking system. It's hard to explain, nobody is supposed to understand it, there are some sites to get bits and pieces about it. I would just argue, do you really understand how money is created? Who is in charge of it? If not, you should figure it out. Somebody is printing this stuff. Somebody controls the interest rates. It's a lot of economics you need to understand because it literally affects the whole world. But, I will admit that I over simplified and cannot explain to you what I mean -- but will also admit I did not say anything to mislead anyone.\n\nAs for the US government not caring about human rights. I don't know why that is really a conspiracy theory. I mean, I guess they care enough about it because if they were too overt about bad things there would be riots. Even so, everything from Agent Orange to lying to start the Iraq War to the shit the CIA does around the world is a good place to start. The error in my statement is again suggesting that no one in the US government cares. I think they do care. But I think as a whole, it's run for power not for human rights.\n\nFinally, I also don't see the US attack on Libya as not about human rights being a conspiracy theory. What about Rwanda? Where was the US then? There are so many human rights violations all over the world that the US completely ignore (or the CIA incites by funding coups - ie: all over South America). Suddenly they go into Libya, and it's right when Gaddafi is challenging the US dollar, just like how they went into Iraq right after Saddam said he was going to trade oil in Euros not dollars...I'd like to see your sources that suggest it WAS simply done for humanitarian reasons. \n\nAlso, if the US is only fighting in the middle east 'for humanitarian reasons', then I suppose you are arguing the United States is of the most ineffective and literally incompetent establishments the world has ever seen. Since now ISIS has spread everywhere and the middle east is a HELL of a lot worse than before. So if America really wanted to protect human rights they wouldn't go anywhere with their track record. Personally, I have a lot more respect for the competence and capability of the US military industrial complex and while it is full of corruption and inefficiencies, it is undeniably the most powerful and effective military this world has ever seen. I think what is more likely is that their objectives are different than officially stated. And I think considering what following the money suggests, their actual objectives are, it's no surprise they wouldn't want to be honest about it. I'm sure many in charge don't believe the American public has the stomach to do what needs to be done. And since they never discuss it because of this, nobody knows if what they are doing is moral or not. But do they do it for human rights? I think it is about power. And I think they assume power in their hands is better than power in someone elses hands -- but that doesn't make it true or moral.\n\nSo really...I think it's obvious. A nation like America with an industrial military complex does not run on good will. It runs on money and power and those are the carrots they chase. Not human rights. The only people who care about human rights are the American public and their only power is the constitution and their republic, both of which are being dismantled from within.", "id": "d98lbgx"}, {"comment": "we didn't just 'allow things to happen as they did,' we gave direct aid to the groups that we later found out were extremist groups and purposely overthrew the government\n\nhow about *you* cut the shit acting like hillary was being a savior of the people, all she did was ruin their country which interestingly also led to the attack on the consulate in benghazi", "id": "d93nude"}, {"comment": "LOL, where did I say anything about Hillary being the \"savior of the people\".

Showing her that some guys will hit her back if you provoke them enough. In her drunken state she comes to the conclusion that it would be a great idea to hit this guy again because \"I'm a girl, I can hit men and there will be no consequences hur dur\". The fact that he hit her back was solely done as a way to teach her a lesson because the first warning taught her nothing. You can see he doesn't even really hit her hard, he gave her a light tap and she reacts as if he just swung a baseball bat across her face. Where as she went full force with her punch and finished it off with a smile. \n\nIt was done to show her how flawed her thinking is when it comes to why men don't hit women. This girl was taking advantage of the whole \"guys can't hit girls\" thing and was teasing him for it. She was acting as if men go around wishing they could hit women all the time but are unable to because of this \"barrier\". That's not the case, but she kept poking at him and teasing him as if it were. It's a moral rule for men more than it's a \"Shit, I can't hit her back 'cause I'll go to jail.\" rule and it looks like this chick has it backwards. After she got hit she made this face as if this dude somehow just broke the laws of physics. He even tried finishing it off with a handshake and a few words but she was too drunk to realize he was teaching her something.

Idiots like you are ruining America, sometimes all it takes is a sense of humor. Also, I supplied the definition of sexual assault because you are stupid and I want you to be less stupid. \n\n\"Sexual assault is any type of forced or coerced sexual contact or behavior that happens without consent.

Now maybe you need to pull up the definition for me but I'm fairly certain that that is the literal definition of \"forced\". \n\n\nOn the other hand, a person leaning in for a kiss on a first date is not a forced interaction. The recipient can certainly decline the kiss. Evidently,  I'm making far too nuanced a point for your liking. I'm not saying this guy should be brought up on charges. I'm saying that's a stupid and shitty thing to do. *If* (important word) any of those women chose to pursue charges, that guy would not stand any chance in court.

In my country is the same bullshit.", "id": "d1ji52d"}, {"comment": "I don't use mainstream media to get my news and most the things I have heard trump say are what makes me hate him. Not what reporters say. Which I have only seen on Reddit. But surely you can't believe America needs to be like how it was. Unless we are talking the 90's when everything was dope than sure. But that was bill who got our economy back on track in the 90'd after a war in the Middle East. Then post 9/11 the war in the Middle East tanked our economy. Obama has done a good job of bring jobs back so the idea that we are worse off than we were is absurd. And if you all mean pre 80's and before when you say \"make America great again\" than you all are just nuts. We need to keep progressing and not move backwards. That's my take on trump and why I hate him. Not to mention his supporters are toxic and have no idea what they are talking about because half the stuff they supporters is hypocritical. \n\n\nTrump supporters: \n\nA) hate socialism and think Obamacare (a single payer system) has ruined this country. But praise trumps healthcare plan (a single payer system.) they argue Obamacare has many issues. That were caused by over 70 revisions republicans insisted on. \n\nB) hate Bernie supporters because they want free shit. But vote for a man who wants healthcare, raising taxes, and raising minimum wage. All things these supporters have voted against for decades but now all the sudden see the light. Also there is a difference in wanting free shit and just allocating our resources so we become a better economy. Like cut a little bit of military spending and put it into education so we don't let China continue to get smarter than us. Or follow routes like CO and WA and tax pot and use those resources to better the community. That isn't free shit that's called putting my tax money to good use. Instead of wasting it on nonsense. \n\nC) whine about safe place all the time. But yet are the epitome of a safe place. The sub Reddit has a deport button, because they can't have a structured debate without name calling or using the word cuck. Therefore you can see how logical debates are not welcomed in there safe environment. Not to mention the rallies how they punch and kick people out of there safe place and try to run them over for protesting outside. You have the right to a rally but they also have he right to protest you hypocrites. Resorting to violence is also what less educated people do as its their last resort was words are no longer an answer. Hence why they have to deport people from the sub because they can't combat logical criticism towards trump so they deport, which is there way of punching you in the face over Reddit. They are more safe than any college campus and the subreddit for trump is about as safe as a day care for children. So preaching safe space makes you look silly. \n\nD) Hillary flip flops on everything. How can you anyone supporter a flip flopper? Cough cough trump supported the clintons at one point and was a liberal. He also was quoted saying he wanted to ban assault rifles after a mass shooting. Therefore you all are flip flopping on your own damn words and actions considering you hold guns so near to your heart but are voting for a man who potentially could take them away if we see another mass shooting. Not to mention loads of other shit trump has flip flopped on. \n\nE) claiming trump isn't bought like other politicians and that he is self made. He isn't self made as his father built that name up. Second claiming he isn't bought is like having he Koch brothers run and say they aren't bought. Trump is part of the 1 percent. He isn't going up against the establishment he is the establishment. It's absurd to think of him as not being the same as the rest of these rich politicians who are in the pockets of the one percent. \n\nTLDR. I get my information else where and have came to my conclusion from trumps own statements. But most importantly there toxic hypocritical sub Reddit that can't hold a debate other than \"CUCK\" and \"high energy\" is annoying and shows me trump supporters are nothing but children. They care more about their candidate having a hot wife and a big dick than what really matters. As in no way, as an adult, can supporter a group of people who just breath hate and can't rebuttal anyone who challenges there views. It's sad and pathetic that the Republican Party has become this. What ever happen to the well rounded conservatives like Ron Paul. Instead we have people who resort to name calling instead of making someone look stupid with logic.

A man whose few actual policy proposals are so nonsensical and detached from reality that the only appropriate reaction is laughter.  Building a huge wall and somehow making Mexico pay for it; rounding up and deporting millions of illegal immigrants; defaulting on US debt; demanding tribute money from our NATO allies in order to keep our treaties with them; the list goes on.\n\nThis is not about ideological differences like Bush vs Kerry or Gore, or Obama vs McCain or Romney.  This is about somebody so ignorant, so poorly suited to be President, that merely electing him would be a world-destabilizing event, with the potential to escalate to a full-blown global catastrophe if he were to act on some of his more outlandish proposals (nukes, defaulting on US debt, etc).\n\nSo yeah, my point is--both sides are *clearly not* the same.

At the very worst you end up with a more rounded hang, but depending on factors like tissue composition that can already occur in nature.  Nature doesn't make breasts that are almost perfectly round top to bottom.\n\nSo why get a subglandular implant if subpectoral looks better?  Cost and recovery, mainly.  Subpectoral implants are harder to put in, require the surgeon to work deeper, and you add muscle healing to the equation.\n\nOf course, no matter how you do it, a 500cc implant is going to look fake.

This lateral force doesn't oppose the steering angle caused by the disturbance, it adds to it. It's a positive feedback, which is unstable. Once the vehicle does a 180, the center of gravity is in front of the center of that lateral force so it's now in a stable condition - after a disturbance it returns to it's previous condition.

If they stay dry, they should be good, right?", "id": "d41vb0b"}, {"comment": "Wow this is the first time my work has been relevant on reddit. \n\nMost new dishwashers will produce very little condensation, if any. Especially if you get a KitchenAid, Whirlpool, or Maytag (the three best brands of dishwasher, imo). Nowadays they are insulated to the brim on the inside, plus there is an extra layer of insulation that goes on the outside.\n\nBelieve me if there was any chance of condensation making it outside a dishwasher people wouldn't use them. Because they'd ruin their cabinets. \n\nEdit: I will take this moment to let you guys in on some secrets because I've been wanting an excuse to say this stuff on reddit for a while.\n\nIf you buy a dishwasher, buy one of the three I listed above. Samsungs or OK, but not great. KitchenAid is top dog. For the love of all that is holy DO NOT get a Bosch. They break easily and most of them don't even have fucking heating elements. That means it doesn't even *dry your dishes*. Some of them you literally have to leave the door open so they can dry. Why? Because efficiency. Bosch is all about being the \"greenest\". I'll pay an extra $30 a year in electricity if it means my dishes actually get fully cleaned thank you.\n\nAlso stop using liquid soap. Shit will clog up your jets in a heartbeat, especially the new ones. Use the pods that a full of powder. Cascade is best, Finish is worst. My family uses store brand ones that haven't given us any problems.\n\nAlso, if all of a sudden your dishwasher is no longer draining water there might be a very simple solution. Did you have to replace your garbage disposal recently? If so, chances are your plumber didn't knock out the stopper that lets the dishwasher drain into the disposal. Sooooo many people replace their entire dishwasher because of a small piece of plastic that takes less than a minute to remove. Another problem could be your drain is clogged. One way to fix this is by running a cycle with no dishes and a large glass of CLR/vinegar. Not guaranteed to work YRMV\n\nEdit 2: Some people have disagreed with me concerning my statements about Bosch, and that's totally fine. If you've found a company that works for what you want keep going at it. I'm simply relaying my experiences in this line of work.

I find it hard to believe a court decided to victim blame in this case, but easy to believe the costs involved made a deal worthwhile.  Hope he countered with direct criminal charges and made the kid pay criminal fines for the damages and serve time at least the same value to him even if he didn't get that money back.\n\nIt's one thing to set an active booby trap like a spring or gravity man-trap or a motion activated gun or tripwire - or an electrified man-trap that is designed specifically to harm people! -  but something completely static and does absolutely no harm to anyone that doesn't do their best to hurt themself on it actively is something else entirely. \n\n***EDIT*** People have a hard time understanding the difference between a booby trap and a mailbox.  Booby traps are illegal because they are *indiscriminate*.   A booby trapped shotgun will kill firemen if there's a fire, hence illegal.

There has never been a law about what mailboxes can be constructed of... mine is fieldstone.  I have a neighbor's that is aged barnwood.  Both are concrete underneath, all of them on the block are, the outside is just whatever the house is sided with, or whatever the accent design was decided to be in the case of the barnwood, they have that for shutters and the porch too but not the whole house.\n\n***EDIT 2***  Dude apparently filled up his mailbox with concrete on the inside - meaning it wasn't a mailbox, it was a lure that was shaped like a mailbox but didn't function like one.  That goes beyond  a robustly constructed mailbox with aesthetically pleasing paint, and makes it a trap.  The courts made the right call and having all the facts is important.

All boobytraps are not per se illegal. \n\nThat said, I don't know what state this video was made in, but I very much doubt that a mild shock like this would render this illegal.\n\nEDIT: To all of the amateur Reddit lawyers telling me I'm wrong, this is the language from *Katko v. Briney*, which all law students are taught their first year of school:\n\n>[T]he law has always placed a higher value upon human\u00a0 safety than upon mere rights in property, it is the accepted rule that there is no privilege to use any force calculated to cause death or serious bodily injury to repel the threat to land or chattels, unless there is also such a threat to the defendant's personal safety as to justify self-defense. Katko v. Briney, 183 N.W.2d 657, 660 (Iowa 1971).\n\nNotice the language \"calculated to cause death or serious bodily injury...\" You would have to look at a state's case law to see what kind of devices would fall under that category, but my best guess is that the mild electric shock here is not calculated to cause death or serious bodily injury. Again, this is just a generality, states may have a completely different framework for deciding the question; the rule in *Briney* is just the general common law on the subject.\n\nTo the people saying \"Well, what if the guy grabbing the sign had a pacemaker, etc.\" Now you're questioning foreseeability, which is part of a negligence framework, which is way too broad a subject for me to get into here. *Briney* is about intentionally causing grave bodily injury (an intentional tort) and the analysis would be completely different under a negligence analysis. That said, I sincerely doubt that the dude who set this sign up thought that he was going to kill or maim someone else.\n\nEither way, I'm not a lawyer until Thursday, so don't take this as being absolutely true. Better yet, if you want to go out and replicate this kind of trap, don't rely on what anyone on the internet (including myself) says.

By the time the Miata came around, emissions and safety requirements had really killed the European roadster.  The MGB was basically the last of those, and look where it was by 1980 (it's final year).  Overweight, underpowered, wrong ride height, ugly bumpers.\n\nMazda did what all good Japanese companies do: they took an existing idea and made it better.  They were able to provide something that the Europeans hadn't really been able to do in the 80s; namely provide a lightweight, fun to drive, RWD roadster.  This was 9 years after the last MGB left Abingdon.\n\nWhich brings us to your other point:\n\n> Mainly because they always started...\n\nThis is spot on, and cannot be understated.  In the early days, people were willing to put up with the eccentricities of owning a British roadster, because the payoff was so good.  But as those benefits (lightweight, decent power, good handling, wonderful looks) faded due to regulations, people were much less willing to put up with the reliability issues.  \n\nReliability hasn't really been a problem for the Japanese, and in the 80s most of the truly fun cars were Japanese (ever driven a 323 GTX?  So much fun, and incidentally has a turbo version of the Miata's 1.6).

It's envenomed. That just sounded stupid to me in my head while I wrote the comment and I think everyone got the point I was trying to make, which is that you will feel the effects of the venom. Also, in this case the venom would not be injected but would act like saliva and just sort of contaminate the wound inflicted by the teeth.

He doesn't want the pissed off ones like the one he slapped because there is still the risk of being bitten which isn't good for this type of show whether the performer got venom in the bite or not. The cobras are defanged via pliers because they aren't concerned about the well-being of the cobras. The sheer numbers you see in the video can tell you why they're not concerned about their individual welfare.\n\nSomeone else mentioned that venomous snakes are sometimes kept as pets and this is done to them as well. While it is true that this still happens, responsible snake owners don't typically defang their venomous snakes. They don't for a few reasons:\n\n1) The fangs are partially used to help the snake swallow prey. Sometimes the snake will figure out how to do it without their fangs, but it's kinda like removing the entirety of a human's tongue and expecting them to be able to eat normally.\n\n2) As I said in my original comment, while defanging the snake does remove its ability to inject venom there is still the risk of being envenomized through a normal bite or any other laceration that comes into contact with any leaking venom. Not an ideal situation.\n\n3) There are better options. Nowadays you can have a vet remove the venom gland of the snake instead of removing the fangs, which allows the snake to retain its ability to eat while simultaneously removing the threat of a venomous bite. This isn't a perfect option either though, as the venom gland can regenerate and the snake can regain the ability to inject venom with a bite.\n\nAll that said, responsible snake owners also don't typically own venomous snakes. They're a hassle, often require a permit to own, and you can't handle them at all without risking a trip to the hospital. It's like trying to own a cougar. Can it be done? Yes. **Should** it be done?
