Another user, who probably had a similar mindset like you, quickly posted a bunch of tumblr comments full of people making up genders, complaining about pronouns, hating on white men, all that jazz.\n\nWithin *minutes*, the first user pointed out that literally every one of those examples were fake. Every - single - one. He even had sources - he tracked the tumblr users down and saw that the accounts were made by TiA users who were just fanning the flames. Or they were accounts who had no other activity except for that screenshot that was provided. The sad thing is that the second user wasn't aware of this. He believed everything that TiA spoonfed him.\n\nI really wish I had saved that exchange - I believe it happened on /r/lewronggeneration - but I didn't and now I can't find it again, unfortunately. You just have to take my word for it.\n\nThese \"special snowflakes\" everyone likes to complain about *are not a problem*. They really aren't.

", "id": "cz800km"}, {"comment": "Not pretending to be on the same level as Shen, but here's my (excessively long) explanation: \n\nNearly every comic artist feels two major forces: the desire to **innovate** and the desire to gain **popularity**. Sometimes, you're [Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com/) and you gain popularity by being innovative and brilliant. Most of the time, though, you're a lesser being who gets one or the other... or neither.\n\nWhen a good comic artist commits to being **innovative**, you get something like [Dorris McComics](http://dorrismccomics.com/): utterly unique and wonderful (IMO), but relatively unpopular except among webcomic enthusiasts.\n\nWhen a comic artist prioritizes **popularity** over innovation, you get something like [Sarah Scribbles](http://sarahcandersen.com/). Sarah sticks to relatable humor, and the results are striking. Every post gets tens of thousands of tumblr notes and likely millions of views across the social media landscape. Because it's shareable! It's relatable! It makes everyone feel like they're not alone in the world!\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that. People like what they like, and I won't yuck your yum. But the fact is, once you realize the internet's voracious appetite for simply relatable comics, it becomes this huge sucking void that whispers in your ear, \"*just make it relatable... you'll go viral and everyone will love youuuuu*\". It's hard to ignore when post after post of yours goes down in flames on reddit.\n\nSo here, Shen is snapping between the two forces. He is illustrating himself giving in to relatable humor, but has gone so crazy in the process that he's mixed up the verbs, which becomes an absurd scene... preventing this comic from being relatable. I think it's brilliant, but part of it is a rebellion against popularity, so it's expected that it won't connect with a lot of people.", "id": "cz8cssc"}, {"comment": "This is a really well thought out post, and it's totally true.

Affirmative Action makes up for past racism by preferring an ethnicity that has been discriminated against over an equally-qualified, non-discriminated-against ethnicity. The idea is to get under-represented people into a position so that future hiring can be non-discriminatory, despite the possibility of preferring one's own ethnic group or culture.\n\nNumbers don't have to be perfect, but the idea is there. Some organizations may take this too far. It's not racism, it's a mistake.\n\nb. No one thinks these things: \n\n-- i. \"I must hire an exact ratio.\" (If this happens it's not racism, it's implementing a theory in practice.)\n   \n-- ii. \"A non-diverse group can't function.\" \n\nPanel 3a.

No one thinks Muslims don't know any better (because they are inferior, ignorant, or any other reason).\n \nc. \"America made you do it\": Actions by America may cause people to dislike America and become violent against it. That is true. Many do not think that violence is justified by other negative action. The idea is to stop America from doing negative things. It's not to allow others to do negative things to America. Some people may think America's bad actions justify violence. However, this is not racism, this is a philosophical perspective.\n\nd. \"Your brown skin makes you peaceful and innocent\":\n    \n-- i. Thinking someone is better because of their ethnicity *is* racist. I'm sure some people think that. Probably not very many.\n    \n-- ii. Romanticizing ethnicities and cultures is not racist, it's romanticizing. It's an inaccurate view of something. It may ignore faults; it may idealize aspects; it may imagine aspects.

That may have been a deliberate confusion intended as part of the 'joke', but comes off as jarringly inconsistent, since the 'left' and 'right' labels, the respective exaggerated attitudes and conventionally associated colors are in the 'correct' place. Reversing the orientation on its own seems poorly done, and not entirely thought out (or worse accidental), muddying any desired effect.  It's reminiscent of [a recent post of an old horseshoe theory comic, maybe a similarly poor attempt at political satire](https://www.reddit.com/r/PropagandaPosters/comments/5dzlij/middle_of_the_road_church_of_the_subgenius_1983/), where the left and the right are also purported to 'meet'.  There it's in the degree of their fanaticism, while here it's in the similarity of their extremes.  It's rather telling that you can have *two* 'horseshoe' theory comics, going along entirely different axes with incompatible premises.  Which are we meant to believe? That they're similarly fanatical with diametrically opposed views, or with similar views but diametrically opposed fanaticism?  Do we selfishly just pick which ever is most conveniently in any given situation, luxuriating blissfully in ignorance of the inconsistency?  \n\nIn both, the right wing caricatures are almost not stereotypes, but uncomfortably close to nearly common and dangerously realistic, while the left wing caricatures are virtually all ludicrously unrealistic, maybe next to impossible to find, which suggests how far right the spectrum was or is being pushed.  Maybe one shouldn't underestimate left wing fools, but there just don't seem to be many and not like how this comic portrays them.  \n\nWho dates anyone because they want to appear 'progressive'?  Why would they care what anyone or society 'thinks'?  Who cares more about their publicly identifiable political affiliations when dating than their private sexual preferences, and what would you call that mental illness? Seriously, has any company manager *ever* spouted idiocy about 'reeses pieces' and 'muh racism' and argued that religiously, racially, ethnically or sexually homogeneous companies don't function? At the very least that's historically naive and would be some novel economic theory!  Who on the left condones murder and rape, infantilizes and conflates 'brown skin' with 'muslim'?  It's doubtful anyone on the left could even be offended by these, they so widely miss the target, even if you're somewhat sympathetic to the last two panels, and the notions that affirmative action is often just ill considered reactionary counter racism, and that obsession with racial purity and cultural dominance (e.g segretation and KKK) isn't categorically different from monomania over purported oppression of not being in the positions perceived as having the greatest privilege (e.g. safes spaces and BLM.  Just one interpretation of the last two panels).\n\n'Normal' the status quo is already incredibly systematically, institutionally, politically, socially and economically racist, while both comics only focus on individually ridiculous motives.  If this is meant to be satire too, it even utterly misses the mark even in that respect.  You can believe a guy would hate blacks if he keeps getting mugged by them, or a woman hating white men, if they keep getting promoted over her for example, but that's not so much funny 'ha-ha' as funny 'turn your stomach' feeling.  \n\n<added> Also all the 'lefties' have glasses and all the 'righties' don't.

So it goes in the left column because Westerners read left to right (and most of the world if I'm not mistaken). This then naturally leads the reader to assume the middle panel would be the \"neutral\" party in terms of how the message is being displayed.

Maybe some of the information is helpful to people who have the mistaken idea that the points in the comic are accurate.\n\nIncidentally, if one has a grievance about an issue it's best if they bring it up with the person with whom they have the grievance. They must first find a person who has said something that aggrieves them, they must feel comfortable talking with that person, the other person must be able to talk about it, then there must be a thorough conversation.

Affirmative Action makes up for past racism by preferring an ethnicity that has been discriminated against over an equally-qualified, non-discriminated-against ethnicity.

That is true. Many do not think that violence is justified by other negative action. The idea is to stop America from doing negative things. It's not to allow others to do negative things to America. Some people may think America's bad actions justify violence. However, this is not racism, this is a philosophical perspective.\n\nd. \"Your brown skin makes you peaceful and innocent\":\n    \n-- i. Thinking someone is better because of their ethnicity *is* racist. I'm sure some people think that. Probably not very many.\n    \n-- ii.

Occasionally approached by aspiring females competitors.\n\nFemales who are actively lifting more than the average male: Get stared at by most. Occasionally approached by other powerlifters.\n\nNormal Male: Only approached by other men, and more commonly if gay.\n\nMale who has an IFBB Pro Physique: Get stared at by most. Occasionally approached by other males who tend to brag about themselves.\n\nMales who are actively lifting more than most males: Get stared at by most, especially during the lift. Occasionally approached by males.\n\n---\n\nThere are major exceptions: rbf and eye contact. Having rbf is one deterrent and lowers the chance of having anybody approaching. Avoiding eye contact will make a conversation impossible for every category except normal female.\n\nAn individual judges themselves even subconsciously and determines which mate is *in* or *out* of their league. Unfortunately, normal female is generally in every males league. Once a female begins looking like she does more than cardio machines, she slowly moves into IFBB Pro Physique and becomes more difficult for males to approach.\n\nThere are also a ton more generalizations, like obese males/females, things can become quite complicated. From my experience, obese tend to be ignored and stared at until they move into the normal category.\n\n*Note: This is just my general experience with mainstream gyms.

There is no scientific reason to believe something just because there is no evidence *against* it. There needs to be evidence *for* it. And this makes sense, the scientific method and how we figure things out would not work if every claim any person made had to be taken as true until proven wrong.

First, the key issue is whether an \"action\" was taken or force excerted to restrict the content. A discussion, a petition, or a simple request arguably have no \"force\" behind them - there is no stick.  However, social media or publishing campaigns can have an implied force when they publicly state that if a company does not change its content to match a group's moral view, it is sexist, racist, or immoral.  That's the stick, and it was used very well in the 80's by parent-teacher morality groups and it's used well by the left now. \n\nSecond, I'll leave the Tracer stuff to Google searches.  If there are articles stating that blizzard would be sexist to use the pose or a gamer would be sexist to buy the game then there is the applied \"force\".   \n\nFinally, don't mix up free speech and censorship. Two different things.  FS involves government action and there is none here. And I'm certainly not saying that only one side does censorship. If I apply force to restrict content then I'm censoring.  Shoot, if I downvote a comment that offends me, I'm censoring it.   I am not against censorship. The big issue is that people want to censor stuff while pretending to be against censorship.

If there are archived public statements, I was correct, if not, there was no force applied and it was just discussions - no censorship - you were correct.    \n\nMy real issue is simply that people are currently rushing to use censorship when content conflicts with their morals.  That's normal and censorship isn't inherently evil. But people are also telling themselves a lie when they say censorship  isn't censorship. That's dangerous. If you don't know that you are using censorship you don't weigh its use carefully.
