A right is not some thing you can demand from others and they must give to you. You don't have a right to demand access to water, though you have a right to it. A right is simply that, presuming you can access the thing, another is wrong if they try to stop you.\n\nA right is a thing that others aren't allowed to stop you from doing. It goes along with free peoples in free countries. Its the whole \"my rights begin where your rights end\", meaning you may act freely so long as that does not negatively impact another's ability to act freely.\n\nNearly everything is a \"right\" in a country of free people, though sometimes legislatures or judicial branches need to affirm the fine line of the strength of a right. If I build a house, may I pass electrical lines through my neighbors property? In some places, yes, the legislature says yes you may, without your neighbors consent, presuming that your decision does not negatively affect your neighbor, insert an electrical line across your neighbors property, as your right to access electricity has been strengthened by the legislature to, in this instance, supercede the property owner's right.\n\nA legislature does NOT grant rights. Republican government cannot grant rights. Rights belong to a free people. The governments of the states are built upon the rights of the people. For evidence of this aspect, please examine Washington State RCW 42.56.030\n\n>The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. \n\nSimply put, this is saying the government's powers are delegated by the people to the government organization, but are not transferred nor given, and the people are superior to their creation.

In some places, yes, the legislature says yes you may, without your neighbors consent, presuming that your decision does not negatively affect your neighbor, insert an electrical line across your neighbors property, as your right to access electricity has been strengthened by the legislature to, in this instance, supercede the property owner's right.\n\nA legislature does NOT grant rights.

Our fundamental rights are aspects of our existence which are intrinsic to us by nature, and which we're not willing to surrender as a condition or a consequence of entering into social relations to others -- that's what /u/justinduane's \"desert island\" concept is referring to. \n\n A model of rights sets the boundaries against which we define our social relations, and to which we refer to censure behavior that transgresses those boundaries.  As implemented by formal systems of law, the concept of rights means that the law shall not *interfere* with your pursuit of the object of that right.  Acknowledging the right to free speech implies that no one may suppress speech you've undertaken on your own initiative, but it does not imply that anyone is obligated to actively give you a platform.  Acknowledging the right to bear arms implies that no one may suppress your acquisition and maintenance weapons for your defense, but it does not imply that anyone is obligated to supply you with free weapons.\n\nWe can certainly regard health care or internet access as rights in this sense: no one may artificially *block* you from pursuing the objects in question, but it's still up to you to pursue them, whether on your own or by interacting with others, and to do so without violating anyone else's rights in the process.

", "id": "d7dj0ns"}, {"comment": "Since Jony Ives has admitted he \"worships at the alter of [Dieter] Rams\", and Apple has [taken some...inspiration](http://i.imgur.com/TRqlYuO.gif) from Braun before, let's see which of [Rams' Ten Principles of Good Design](https://www.vitsoe.com/rw/about/good-design) they've broken:\n\n>2) **Good design makes a product useful**\n\n>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.\n\nThis makes the iPhone less useful - less compatible with other headsets, fiddlier to use with existing ones, not to mention now forcing the headphones you're \"meant\" to be using to now have a battery life (and become lost easily...) And no, you may not listen to music while charging your phone if you use traditional buds. \n\n>3) **Good design is aesthetic**\n\n>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.\n\n\"Dongles are beautiful\" said exactly no one ever. And dongles will be what most people end up using.\n\n>4) **Good design makes a product understandable**\n\n>It clarifies the product\u2019s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.\n\n\"Where do my headphones go? The charging port is now the headphone port? What if I want to charge my phone and listen to music at the same time?\" These are all questions that Apple's customers are gonna ask, and Apple specifically targets the less tech-savvy consumer who will not understand the change. \n\n>6) **Good design is honest**\n\n>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.\n\nThere is zero practical innovation in combining the Lightning and headphone ports (it is *technically* innovating, which is why I gave the phone as pass on Rule 1). But it does specifically manipulate the consumer in the belief that a) it would make the phone thinner (it hasn't), and b) the sound quality has been improved (there was literally nothing wrong with the three-analogue cable method of the 3.5mm TRS plug, a tiny DAC mounted in a pair of wireless buds is not going to be better one in a phone, and Apple's mantra of making everyone believe that anything they do is revolutionary and an improvement). The all-in-one port does the exact same job as the headphone port, just in a Rube Goldberg-esque way.\n\n>7) **Good design is long-lasting**\n\n>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years \u2013 even in today\u2019s throwaway society.\n\nAnd by that very  definition, the TRS headphone plug is fundamentally good design. It traces its lineage back to...1878. It slipped so far into the background it became recognisable all over the work, it hasn't changed, hasn't needed to be changed (save for adding a ring or two, or shrinking it from 6.5 to 3.5/2.5mm, both of which still follow the same design principles as the original), and...well, it works perfectly. \n\nThis Lightning port audio will work...until Apple ditches the Lightning port (which they will). The Lightning port is specifically being promoted as a fashionable (ie, high-tech, which is fashionable) solution to a problem that...well, didn't really exist. \n\n>8) **Good design is thorough down to the last detail**\n\n>Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.\n\nWill the headphones have decent range? Will people remember to charge them? What if the battery in the left earbud fails faster than the one in the right? Is there are way to easily measure the power consumer of the earbuds? What about how you can now lose each earbud individually?\n\n>9) **Good design is environmentally-friendly**\n\n>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.\n\nThis is definitely a decadent solution. Making your earbud less compatible makes them more disposable, as does being able to lose them so easily. More electronics in the earbuds means more e-waste, since I imagine these buds will be lost and broken more than the phones themselves, not to mention thrown out if you buy a non-Apple phone later.\n\n>10) **Good design is as little design as possible**\n\n>Less, but better \u2013 because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.\n\n>Back to purity, back to simplicity\n\nThe combo-port is most definitely the *opposite* of that. It takes a simply function (transferring audio from a device to your headphones) - a problem solved over a hundred years ago to the satisfaction of millions, if not billions, of people in that time - and adds a bunch of stuff to make it work - and *wireless* stuff too, no less. To return to any semblance of the purity and simplicity of the TRS jack, you need to use a dongle - more complexity. \n\nDieter Rams would not be happy. Rube Goldberg, however, would be pleased as piss.\n", "id": "d7drrmf"}], [{"comment": "Google kills the Nexus, then Apple removes the headphone jack.

Without tight engineering controls, you can end up letting out your conditioned air and introducing unwanted condensation to a finished space, resulting in wasted energy/money and potential damage to interior finished surfaces.

Either a robot or a human can then reach in and grab the battery out (might have to apply some heat to loosen the adhesive).  \n\nYou could also do this another way- have the saw cut just a little outside the battery, meaning most of the phone is cut off rather than just a few mm of outer casing, all that's left is the phone that's sandwiching the battery top and bottom, and a few mm on each side.  This makes separation easy as you can use the width to separate- jam it through an opening just as wide as the phone, which has internal fixed blades at points that put them just above and below the battery, so it basically slices the battery out of the phone.

One day that data will be available to anyone and we will have so called \"judgement day\".\n\nAt the moment from the information that is being sucked out of us they are making databases and are segregating the whole population into categories.\nAs for today you can ask facebook if somebody is pretending to be you, meaning that they have your individual profile ready. \n\nThey know what porn you watch, how often, and record you if you have a (\"smart\"phone or any other kind of internet connected) camera pointing at you.

They know your health state and there is a high chance they are using this data to predict a bit of future.\n\nThese people know more about us than our parents, yet we know close to zero about them. It is a civil espionage that is legalised by your government, and its sold via mass media. Check how many kids cartoons today have smartphones in them, soon the children cartoons will have VR just so it can be sold. VR = brain scaner under the disguise.\n\nIf one reads Bruce Schneier security information, one knows about circles of friends on the social media. For example facebook says they are storing your information up to 8th circle. That means that they are storing your info, your friends, friends of your friends(3rd circle), friends of that friends(4th circle) and so on.\n\nNow about the online gaming. All the information you give them for free is used to create your brain profile, how you think, how you make decisions, how attentive your are etc\nIf you know a bit or two about cryptography you could pull pretty nice brain picture of the gamer, and start deciphering it.\n\nNow going to the \"internet of things\" I will paste this excerpt from Bruce:\n\n** *** ***** ******* *********** *************\n\n      The Internet of Things Will Be the World's Biggest Robot\n\n\n\nThe Internet of Things is the name given to the computerization of\neverything in our lives. Already you can buy Internet-enabled\nthermostats, light bulbs, refrigerators, and cars. Soon everything will\nbe on the Internet: the things we own, the things we interact with in\npublic, autonomous things that interact with each other.\n\nThese \"things\" will have two separate parts. One part will be sensors\nthat collect data about us and our environment. Already our smartphones\nknow our location and, with their onboard accelerometers, track our\nmovements. Things like our thermostats and light bulbs will know who is\nin the room. Internet-enabled street and highway sensors will know how\nmany people are out and about -- and eventually who they are. Sensors\nwill collect environmental data from all over the world.\n\nThe other part will be actuators. They'll affect our environment. Our\nsmart thermostats aren't collecting information about ambient\ntemperature and who's in the room for nothing; they set the temperature\naccordingly. Phones already know our location, and send that information\nback to Google Maps and Waze to determine where traffic congestion is;\nwhen they're linked to driverless cars, they'll automatically route us\naround that congestion. Amazon already wants autonomous drones to\ndeliver packages. The Internet of Things will increasingly perform\nactions for us and in our name.\n\nIncreasingly, human intervention will be unnecessary. The sensors will\ncollect data. The system's smarts will interpret the data and figure out\nwhat to do. And the actuators will do things in our world. You can think\nof the sensors as the eyes and ears of the Internet, the actuators as\nthe hands and feet of the Internet, and the stuff in the middle as the\nbrain. This makes the future clearer. The Internet now senses, thinks,\nand acts.\n\nWe're building a world-sized robot, and we don't even realize it.\n\nI've started calling this robot the World-Sized Web.\n\nThe World-Sized Web -- can I call it WSW? -- is more than just the\nInternet of Things. Much of the WSW's brains will be in the cloud, on\nservers connected via cellular, Wi-Fi, or short-range data networks.\nIt's mobile, of course, because many of these things will move around\nwith us, like our smartphones. And it's persistent. You might be able to\nturn off small pieces of it here and there, but in the main the WSW will\nalways be on, and always be there.\n\nNone of these technologies are new, but they're all becoming more\nprevalent. I believe that we're at the brink of a phase change around\ninformation and networks. The difference in degree will become a\ndifference in kind. That's the robot that is the WSW.\n\nThis robot will increasingly be autonomous, at first simply and\nincreasingly using the capabilities of artificial intelligence. Drones\nwith sensors will fly to places that the WSW needs to collect data.\nVehicles with actuators will drive to places that the WSW needs to\naffect. Other parts of the robots will \"decide\" where to go, what data\nto collect, and what to do.\n\nWe're already seeing this kind of thing in warfare; drones are\nsurveilling the battlefield and firing weapons at targets. Humans are\nstill in the loop, but how long will that last? And when both the data\ncollection and resultant actions are more benign than a missile strike,\nautonomy will be an easier sell.\n\nBy and large, the WSW will be a benign robot. It will collect data and\ndo things in our interests; that's why we're building it. But it will\nchange our society in ways we can't predict, some of them good and some\nof them bad. It will maximize profits for the people who control the\ncomponents. It will enable totalitarian governments. It will empower\ncriminals and hackers in new and different ways. It will cause power\nbalances to shift and societies to change.\n\nThese changes are inherently unpredictable, because they're based on the\nemergent properties of these new technologies interacting with each\nother, us, and the world. In general, it's easy to predict technological\nchanges due to scientific advances, but much harder to predict social\nchanges due to those technological changes. For example, it was easy to\npredict that better engines would mean that cars could go faster. It was\nmuch harder to predict that the result would be a demographic shift into\nsuburbs. Driverless cars and smart roads will again transform our cities\nin new ways, as will autonomous drones, cheap and ubiquitous\nenvironmental sensors, and a network that can anticipate our needs.\n\nMaybe the WSW is more like an organism. It won't have a single mind.\nParts of it will be controlled by large corporations and governments.\nSmall parts of it will be controlled by us. But writ large its behavior\nwill be unpredictable, the result of millions of tiny goals and billions\nof interactions between parts of itself.\n\nWe need to start thinking seriously about our new world-spanning robot.\nThe market will not sort this out all by itself. By nature, it is\nshort-term and profit-motivated -- and these issues require broader\nthinking. University of Washington law professor Ryan Calo has proposed\na Federal Robotics Commission as a place where robotics expertise and\nadvice can be centralized within the government. Japan and Korea are\nalready moving in this direction.\n\nSpeaking as someone with a healthy skepticism for  another government\nagency, I think we need to go further. We need to create agency, a\nDepartment of Technology Policy, that can deal with the WSW in all its\ncomplexities. It needs the power to aggregate expertise and advice other\nagencies, and probably the authority to regulate when appropriate.

One day that data will be available to anyone and we will have so called \"judgement day\".\n\nAt the moment from the information that is being sucked out of us they are making databases and are segregating the whole population into categories.\nAs for today you can ask facebook if somebody is pretending to be you, meaning that they have your individual profile ready. \n\nThey know what porn you watch, how often, and record you if you have a (\"smart\"phone or any other kind of internet connected) camera pointing at you. They know what you like, what you buy if paying by bank-card, and the same goes for your friends. They know your health state and there is a high chance they are using this data to predict a bit of future.\n\nThese people know more about us than our parents, yet we know close to zero about them. It is a civil espionage that is legalised by your government, and its sold via mass media. Check how many kids cartoons today have smartphones in them, soon the children cartoons will have VR just so it can be sold. VR = brain scaner under the disguise.\n\nIf one reads Bruce Schneier security information, one knows about circles of friends on the social media. For example facebook says they are storing your information up to 8th circle. That means that they are storing your info, your friends, friends of your friends(3rd circle), friends of that friends(4th circle) and so on.\n\nNow about the online gaming. All the information you give them for free is used to create your brain profile, how you think, how you make decisions, how attentive your are etc\nIf you know a bit or two about cryptography you could pull pretty nice brain picture of the gamer, and start deciphering it.\n\nNow going to the \"internet of things\" I will paste this excerpt from Bruce:\n\n** *** ***** ******* *********** *************\n\n      The Internet of Things Will Be the World's Biggest Robot\n\n\n\nThe Internet of Things is the name given to the computerization of\neverything in our lives. Already you can buy Internet-enabled\nthermostats, light bulbs, refrigerators, and cars. Soon everything will\nbe on the Internet: the things we own, the things we interact with in\npublic, autonomous things that interact with each other.\n\nThese \"things\" will have two separate parts. One part will be sensors\nthat collect data about us and our environment. Already our smartphones\nknow our location and, with their onboard accelerometers, track our\nmovements. Things like our thermostats and light bulbs will know who is\nin the room. Internet-enabled street and highway sensors will know how\nmany people are out and about -- and eventually who they are. Sensors\nwill collect environmental data from all over the world.\n\nThe other part will be actuators. They'll affect our environment. Our\nsmart thermostats aren't collecting information about ambient\ntemperature and who's in the room for nothing; they set the temperature\naccordingly. Phones already know our location, and send that information\nback to Google Maps and Waze to determine where traffic congestion is;\nwhen they're linked to driverless cars, they'll automatically route us\naround that congestion. Amazon already wants autonomous drones to\ndeliver packages. The Internet of Things will increasingly perform\nactions for us and in our name.\n\nIncreasingly, human intervention will be unnecessary. The sensors will\ncollect data. The system's smarts will interpret the data and figure out\nwhat to do. And the actuators will do things in our world. You can think\nof the sensors as the eyes and ears of the Internet, the actuators as\nthe hands and feet of the Internet, and the stuff in the middle as the\nbrain. This makes the future clearer. The Internet now senses, thinks,\nand acts.\n\nWe're building a world-sized robot, and we don't even realize it.\n\nI've started calling this robot the World-Sized Web.\n\nThe World-Sized Web -- can I call it WSW? -- is more than just the\nInternet of Things. Much of the WSW's brains will be in the cloud, on\nservers connected via cellular, Wi-Fi, or short-range data networks.\nIt's mobile, of course, because many of these things will move around\nwith us, like our smartphones. And it's persistent. You might be able to\nturn off small pieces of it here and there, but in the main the WSW will\nalways be on, and always be there.\n\nNone of these technologies are new, but they're all becoming more\nprevalent. I believe that we're at the brink of a phase change around\ninformation and networks. The difference in degree will become a\ndifference in kind. That's the robot that is the WSW.\n\nThis robot will increasingly be autonomous, at first simply and\nincreasingly using the capabilities of artificial intelligence. Drones\nwith sensors will fly to places that the WSW needs to collect data.\nVehicles with actuators will drive to places that the WSW needs to\naffect. Other parts of the robots will \"decide\" where to go, what data\nto collect, and what to do.\n\nWe're already seeing this kind of thing in warfare; drones are\nsurveilling the battlefield and firing weapons at targets. Humans are\nstill in the loop, but how long will that last? And when both the data\ncollection and resultant actions are more benign than a missile strike,\nautonomy will be an easier sell.\n\nBy and large, the WSW will be a benign robot. It will collect data and\ndo things in our interests; that's why we're building it. But it will\nchange our society in ways we can't predict, some of them good and some\nof them bad. It will maximize profits for the people who control the\ncomponents. It will enable totalitarian governments. It will empower\ncriminals and hackers in new and different ways. It will cause power\nbalances to shift and societies to change.\n\nThese changes are inherently unpredictable, because they're based on the\nemergent properties of these new technologies interacting with each\nother, us, and the world. In general, it's easy to predict technological\nchanges due to scientific advances, but much harder to predict social\nchanges due to those technological changes. For example, it was easy to\npredict that better engines would mean that cars could go faster. It was\nmuch harder to predict that the result would be a demographic shift into\nsuburbs. Driverless cars and smart roads will again transform our cities\nin new ways, as will autonomous drones, cheap and ubiquitous\nenvironmental sensors, and a network that can anticipate our needs.\n\nMaybe the WSW is more like an organism. It won't have a single mind.\nParts of it will be controlled by large corporations and governments.\nSmall parts of it will be controlled by us. But writ large its behavior\nwill be unpredictable, the result of millions of tiny goals and billions\nof interactions between parts of itself.\n\nWe need to start thinking seriously about our new world-spanning robot.\nThe market will not sort this out all by itself. By nature, it is\nshort-term and profit-motivated -- and these issues require broader\nthinking. University of Washington law professor Ryan Calo has proposed\na Federal Robotics Commission as a place where robotics expertise and\nadvice can be centralized within the government. Japan and Korea are\nalready moving in this direction.\n\nSpeaking as someone with a healthy skepticism for  another government\nagency, I think we need to go further. We need to create agency, a\nDepartment of Technology Policy, that can deal with the WSW in all its\ncomplexities. It needs the power to aggregate expertise and advice other\nagencies, and probably the authority to regulate when appropriate. We\ncan argue the details, but there is no existing government entity that\nhas the either the expertise or authority to tackle something this broad\nand far reaching. And the question is not about whether government will\nstart regulating these technologies, it's about how smart they'll be\nwhen they do it.\n\nThe WSW is being built right now, without anyone noticing, and it'll be\nhere before we know it. Whatever changes it means for society, we don't\nwant it to take us by surprise.\n\n****************************\nWe all are building a robot that will be superior to us, without even knowing it.\nHave you seen matrix? :]\nHope that answers a bit of your question.", "id": "d1o2gw9"}], [{"comment": "This is actually a good place to post this.

Many of us fought this; the far right shouted that the NSA would never abuse its power and they needed these new allowances to catch terrorists. We didn't buy it, but they passed the law anyway, and we weren't happy - remember, Bush barely won re-election and much of it had to do with this. The Republicans held all three branches of power and literally locked Democrats out of sessions and meetings, and did pretty much whatever they wanted. \n\nThen, a few years later, Edward Snowden says 'hey, the NSA is spying on everybody' and everybody loses their mind.

Snowden's initial leak showed that the US was intercepting and collecting metadata on virtually every domestic phone call.  Courts have struck that down as illegal, and Congress voted to change the law once it came to light.  This is whistleblowing at its finest.\n\nBut Snowden didn't just leak information about illegal or unpopular domestic spying programs.  The vast majority of his (published) leaks were about legal, popular foreign spying operations.  \n\nThis includes the US spying on allies, enemies, and everything in between.  It also includes US intelligence about foreign countries spying on each other.  Americans, and Congress, support the vast majority of international surveillance.  And there's nothing illegal--much less unconstitutional, about foreign surveillance. Leaking classified information just because you personally disagree with a program is not whistleblowing, and the government cannot function if it allows its employees to sabotage any program they dislike. \n\nSnowden is accused of violating the [Espionage Act](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793), not for treason, which applies to:\n\n>**Whoever, lawfully having possession of**, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or ***information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates***, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted ***the same to any person not entitled to receive it***, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;\n\nNow why would the US think that Snowden is giving information to foreign countries that could be used to the advantage of those countries and/or to the injury of the US?  Oh, right, because Snowden claims that he took the Booz Allen job to gain access information about specific foreign computers the NSA was hacking so that he could give that information to foreign journalists to publish.\n\n[Snowden on his plans](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/exclusive-snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa?login=1): \n\n>\u201cMy position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago. . . . If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US network operations against their people should be published.\u201d\n\n[What Snowden gave China while he was in Hong Kong, which is likely what he wants to do for other countries](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all):\n\n>Classified US government data shown to the South China Morning Post by whistle-blower Edward Snowden has provided a rare insight into the effectiveness of Washington's top-secret global cyberspying programme....\n>\n>...The detailed records - which cannot be independently verified - ***show specific dates and the IP addresses of computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland hacked by the National Security Agency over a four-year period***.\n>\n>They also include information indicating whether an attack on a computer was ongoing or had been completed, along with an amount of additional operational information.\n\n[Glenn Greenwald on June 25](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html):\n\n>Greenwald said he would not have published some of the stories that ran in the South China Morning Post. \u201cWhether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don\u2019t think I would have,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201c***What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.***\u201d\n\n[Glenn Greenwald on July 2](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/352213748917874688):\n\n>I think there's a difference between what really motivated him to leak & what he's leaked out of self-preservation\n\nSo even Greenwald agrees that the later leaks are not whistleblowing.  Leaking classified and sensitive operational information to the Chinese to \"ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China\" may not be treason or spying, but it's certainly not whistleblowing.\n\nHere's famed [NSA whistleblower William Binney](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/16/snowden-whistleblower-nsa-officials-roundtable/2428809/) discussing the difference between the domestic whistleblowing and the leaking of foreign surveillance targets:\n\n> Q: There's a question being debated whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor.\n> \n> Binney: Certainly he performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing.

But if you're just driving around with a dongle in the port then I guess that's on you.\n\nSo I can see how it would potentially cause issues with a ridesharing program because people will have access to the car and can do stuff through the OBD port.

", "id": "d368tq2"}, {"comment": "**Why a staggering number of Americans have stopped using the Internet the way they used to**\n\nNearly one in two Internet users say privacy and security concerns have now stopped them from doing basic things online \u2014 such as posting to social networks, expressing opinions in forums or even buying things from websites, according to a new government survey released Friday.\n\nThis chilling effect, pulled out of a survey of 41,000 U.S. households who use the Internet, show the insecurity of the Web is beginning to have consequences that stretch beyond the direct fall-out of an individual losing personal data in breach. The research suggests some consumers are reaching a tipping point where they feel they can no longer trust using the Internet for everyday activities.\n\n\"Every day, billions of people around the world use the Internet to share ideas, conduct financial transactions, and keep in touch with family, friends, and colleagues,\" wrote Rafi Goldberg, a policy analyst at the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, in a blog post introducing the data. \"But for the Internet to grow and thrive, users must continue to trust that their personal information will be secure and their privacy protected.\"\n\nThe survey showed that nearly 20 percent of the survey's respondents had personally experienced some form of identity theft, an online security breach, or another similar problem over the year before the survey was taken last July. Overall, 45 percent said their concerns about online privacy and security stopped them from using the Web in very practical ways. \n\nHere's the data broken down for each individual category:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/STdurX9.jpg\n\nWhen asked to list their biggest concerns, nearly two out of three respondents cited identity theft, while nearly half brought up credit card or banking fraud. About one in five listed data collection by the government.\n\nThe NTIA survey also showed that the more connected devices people owned, the more they experienced a breach of data. For those with only one laptop or computer or smartphone, 9 percent reported a security incident. That number more than tripled for those with at least five devices.\n\nOther surveys have shown that privacy concerns have become more common. A Pew Research study last year found that people overwhelmingly want to control their digital data, but had little confidence that information could stay protected.\n\nPew also found that a significant number of Americans tried a number of different ways to protect their privacy online. Almost 60 percent said they had cleared their cookies or browser history, and nearly one in three said they had deleted or edited something they previously posted online.\n\nBut very few said they had considered using more advanced methods to protect their privacy, such as encrypting their emails. And other Pew research has shown that the majority of Americans find it difficult to figure out the right tools and strategies to meaningfully enhance their privacy.\n\nThe new NTIA data suggests a significant number of Americans have embraced at least one strategy: Opting out of online activities.\n\nThat trend could have major consequences for banks, online retailers, and the broader Internet economy.\n\n\"NTIA\u2019s initial analysis only scratches the surface of this important area, but it is clear that policymakers need to develop a better understanding of mistrust in the privacy and security of the Internet and the resulting chilling effects,\" wrote Goldberg, the NTIA analyst. \"In addition to being a problem of great concern to many Americans, privacy and security issues may reduce economic activity and hamper the free exchange of ideas online.\"", "id": "d360fd8"}, {"comment": "Works fine without Javascript...", "id": "d361nd1"}], [{"comment": "Cliiiccckkbaaiiitttt", "id": "d35zg08"}]]], "55d8un": ["Woman live streams her mugging on Periscope", "2016-10-01 17:43:24", 9, "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/woman-mugged-live-periscope-rebecca-casserly-a7340271.html", [[24, "Regardless of whether or not this would qualify as a mugging, it's still a really crappy headline, there is literally no footage of the mugging, no mugging was broadcast on Periscope.\n\nThe footage is just her talking, and then black.

"], [24, "Here's a reddified copypaste:\n\n#Microsoft Reveals Real Cost Of 'Free' Windows 10\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a free lunch\u201d has been the mantra of those cynical about the [true cost of \u2018free\u2019 Windows 10](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/01/27/when-free-windows-10-becomes-expensive-fear-this/). But as Microsoft [increases pressure](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/02/02/windows-10-automatic-installs-for-windows-7-windows-8/) on users to upgrade, it turns out the real cost of Windows 10 lies somewhere far less expected\u2026     \n\nWindows 7 and Windows 8. Yes, the operating systems which users already paid for (either directly, or indirectly in the cost of a new computer) are getting more expensive by the day. The cost comes in terms of lost productivity, flexibility and enjoyment as Microsoft does its best to make life for Windows 7 and Windows 8 users so unbearable they give in and upgrade to Windows 10.\n\nPrior to February 2016 the cost was already pretty high. On the irritation side Microsoft introduced upgrade prompts for Windows 7 and Windows 8 which reinstalled themselves if users disabled them. The upgrade prompts then became pop-up windows which were continually reworded to cut down choice until \u2018Upgrade now\u2019 or \u2018Upgrade tonight\u2019 or just one option \u2013 \u2018Upgrade now\u2019 \u2013 were all that was presented.\n\nImg: [\u2018Get Windows 10? notifications and upgrade pressure is being cranked ever higher. Image credit: Gordon Kelly](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/12/Windows-10-free-1940x10901-1200x674.png)\n\nIn addition Microsoft also hit many unsuspecting Windows 7 and Windows 8 users in the pocket by silently downloading the whole of Windows 10 (4-6GB) into a secret folder on their computers, even if users had repeatedly stated they did not want to upgrade. Those who have Internet contracts with data allowances found themselves facing inexplicable bills for breaking through those allowances. Windows 8 users could stop this by setting their computers to a [metered allowance](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/metered-internet-connections-frequently-asked-questions) (Windows 7 users were out of luck) but most didn\u2019t know to do this in advance.\n\nAnd this was just the start. Amid [falling adoption rates](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2988223/windows/windows-10-adoption-has-slowed-down-considerably.html), Microsoft announced in October that the real war on users refusing to upgrade to Windows 10 would begin in January. And so it has proved.\n\n#Turning The Screw\n\nMicrosoft has followed through on its widely criticised decision to give Windows 10 \u2018Recommended\u2019 status in Windows Update. This means [installations begin automatically](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/02/02/windows-10-automatic-installs-for-windows-7-windows-8/) for users who have not changed the default Windows Update settings (the vast majority) so they will now have to proactively cancel a Windows 10 upgrade which has already started, rather than the prior approach of saying they don\u2019t want it to start.\n\nFine. Tech savvy users and the most belligerent were happy to cancel the installation and remain on the copies of Windows they chose to pay for. Yet it still isn\u2019t that simple. Infoworld [reports](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3029613/microsoft-windows/new-details-emerge-about-forced-windows-10-upgrade-and-how-to-block-it.html#tk.rss_microsoftwindows) those who cancelled the installation after it started are finding it restarts every time they reboot their computer.\n\nFurthermore many are not even spotting the automatic install in the first place since it comes hidden in the form of a Microsoft EULA (end user licence agreement) which the user is asked to accept. While not advisable, it is commonplace behaviour for customers to blindly accept EULAs without paying full attention to them, but if you do in this case then Windows 10 begins installation and cannot be stopped.\n\nYes this is irritating, but then again with careful reading those users who wish to avoid Windows 10 can still do so and it remains \u201coptional\u201d (as Microsoft continues to stress) even at the cost of continual irritation. You can hold out or even enlist the help of [third party tools](http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/).\n\nImg: [Microsoft is leaving users with little to no choice about upgrading to Windows 10. Image credit: ComputerWorld](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/12/Screenshot-2015-12-16-at-12.53.29-1200x755.png)\n\nExcept Microsoft\u2019s other Windows 10 January upgrade measure even stamps on that plan because how Windows 7 and Windows 8 are supported has also [now been changed](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/01/17/microsoft-windows-7-windows-8-support-cuts/). When you bought Windows 7 and Windows 8 (again I stress you did \u2018buy\u2019 them as they\u2019re built into the cost of your computer) Microsoft promised to support them until 14 January 2020 and 10 January 2023 respectively. Now following the January changes, this is only true on the condition you don\u2019t upgrade your computer to use current or future generation silicon from Intel, AMD or Qualcomm.\n\nIn short: your computer hardware must remain \u2018old\u2019 if you want to keep using Windows 7 or Windows 8 \u2013 implausible for anyone hoping to have a respectable system in 2023. Meanwhile if you buy a new computer and attempt to install Windows 7 or Windows 8 on it, the support will be invalid which means no antivirus or security patches. If you want a new computer you will have to use Windows 10 \u2013 the first time such a restriction has been made in the 30 year history of Windows.\n\nFor now the hardware restriction only applies to businesses, but it seems inconceivable it will not eventually be rolled out to consumers as well.\n\nAnd there is one more trick. For those complaining about Windows 10\u2019s extensive user tracking through telemetry (some of which [cannot be disabled](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/11/02/microsoft-confirms-unstoppable-windows-10-tracking/)) putting them off upgrading, Microsoft has a solution: it has retroactively installed all [the same user tracking](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/08/30/windows-10-spying-on-windows-7-and-windows-8/) on Windows 7 and Windows 8 so this is no longer a reason to avoid upgrading!\n\n#The Increasingly Impossible Choice\n\nAll of which leaves Windows 7 and Windows 8 users in the following situation:\n\n *   Invalidating their support if they upgrade their current computers or buy new computers\n *   Seeing continual Windows 10 upgrade prompts which reinstall themselves if disabled\n *   Facing automatically starting installation attempts every time they reboot their computer\n *   Permanently giving up 6GB of their hard drive space to hold the Windows 10 installation files (typically it redownloads if removed)\n *   Accepting the same user tracking and data logging behaviour as Windows 10\n\nA simple monetary figure cannot be tagged onto these such restrictions, nagging or tracking but for those using Windows 7 and Windows 8 on a daily basis ([currently 65% of the world\u2019s computers](https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0)) the cost is extremely high.\n\nOf course Microsoft has some marketing rhetoric here saying it allows users to roll back to Windows 7 or Windows 8 from Windows 10 if they don\u2019t like the experience. But the roll back simply leaves them facing all the same hassles. Microsoft doesn\u2019t switch them all off just because you \u2018tried\u2019 Windows 10.\n\nImg: [Windows 10 is pegged as a safe haven while Microsoft sets fire to Windows 7 and Windows 8. Image credit: Microsoft](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/02/Screenshot-2016-02-05-at-17.10.48-1200x452.png)\n\nNone of which \u2013 I must stress \u2013 has anything to do with [whether Windows 10 is any good](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/08/02/windows-10-vs-windows-8-vs-windows-7-whats-the-difference/). This isn\u2019t about it being \u2018better\u2019 than Windows 7 or Windows 8, it\u2019s about respecting choice. For some Windows 7 and Windows 8 users they are simply happy where they are or they have critical legacy programs or hardware [which has issues](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3029118/microsoft-windows/microsofts-latest-windows-10-push-may-leave-it-seeing-red.html) on Windows 10. No matter, the same measures are being taken against everyone on Windows 7 and Windows 8 \u2013 there is no \u2018Special Case\u2019 option.\n\nAs such when (and it seems increasingly likely of being when) Windows 10 achieves Microsoft\u2019s one billion installations target, it will be a hollow victory since it comes largely on the back of making the cost of staying on Windows 7 and Windows 8 too much to bear.

But as Microsoft [increases pressure](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/02/02/windows-10-automatic-installs-for-windows-7-windows-8/) on users to upgrade, it turns out the real cost of Windows 10 lies somewhere far less expected\u2026     \n\nWindows 7 and Windows 8. Yes, the operating systems which users already paid for (either directly, or indirectly in the cost of a new computer) are getting more expensive by the day. The cost comes in terms of lost productivity, flexibility and enjoyment as Microsoft does its best to make life for Windows 7 and Windows 8 users so unbearable they give in and upgrade to Windows 10.\n\nPrior to February 2016 the cost was already pretty high. On the irritation side Microsoft introduced upgrade prompts for Windows 7 and Windows 8 which reinstalled themselves if users disabled them. The upgrade prompts then became pop-up windows which were continually reworded to cut down choice until \u2018Upgrade now\u2019 or \u2018Upgrade tonight\u2019 or just one option \u2013 \u2018Upgrade now\u2019 \u2013 were all that was presented.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Rta9qNs.png  \n`'Get Windows 10' notifications and upgrade pressure is being cranked ever higher. Image credit: Gordon Kelly`\n\nIn addition Microsoft also hit many unsuspecting Windows 7 and Windows 8 users in the pocket by silently downloading the whole of Windows 10 (4-6GB) into a secret folder on their computers, even if users had repeatedly stated they did not want to upgrade. Those who have Internet contracts with data allowances found themselves facing inexplicable bills for breaking through those allowances. Windows 8 users could stop this by setting their computers to a [metered allowance](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/metered-internet-connections-frequently-asked-questions) (Windows 7 users were out of luck) but most didn\u2019t know to do this in advance.\n\nAnd this was just the start. Amid [falling adoption rates](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2988223/windows/windows-10-adoption-has-slowed-down-considerably.html), Microsoft announced in October that the [real war](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/10/30/windows-10-upgrades-now-automatic/) on users refusing to upgrade to Windows 10 would begin in January. And so it has proved.\n\n**Turning The Screw**\n\nMicrosoft has followed through on its widely criticised decision to give Windows 10 \u2018Recommended\u2019 status in Windows Update. This means [installations begin automatically](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/02/02/windows-10-automatic-installs-for-windows-7-windows-8/) for users who have not changed the default Windows Update settings (the vast majority) so they will now have to proactively cancel a Windows 10 upgrade which has already started, rather than the prior approach of saying they don\u2019t want it to start.\n\nFine. Tech savvy users and the most belligerent were happy to cancel the installation and remain on the copies of Windows they chose to pay for. Yet it still isn\u2019t that simple.

While not advisable, it is commonplace behaviour for customers to blindly accept EULAs without paying full attention to them, but if you do in this case then Windows 10 begins installation and cannot be stopped.\n\nYes this is irritating, but then again with careful reading those users who wish to avoid Windows 10 can still do so and it remains \u201coptional\u201d (as Microsoft continues to stress) even at the cost of continual irritation. You can hold out or even enlist the help of [third party tools](http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/).\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RaiB2pK.png  \n`Microsoft is leaving users with little to no choice about upgrading to Windows 10.

When you bought Windows 7 and Windows 8 (again I stress you did \u2018buy\u2019 them as they\u2019re built into the cost of your computer) Microsoft promised to support them until 14 January 2020 and 10 January 2023 respectively. Now following the January changes, this is only true on the condition you don\u2019t upgrade your computer to use current or future generation silicon from Intel, AMD or Qualcomm.\n\nIn short: your computer hardware must remain \u2018old\u2019 if you want to keep using Windows 7 or Windows 8 \u2013 implausible for anyone hoping to have a respectable system in 2023. Meanwhile if you buy a new computer and attempt to install Windows 7 or Windows 8 on it, the support will be invalid which means no antivirus or security patches. If you want a new computer you will have to use Windows 10 \u2013 the first time such a restriction has been made in the 30 year history of Windows.\n\nFor now the hardware restriction only applies to businesses, but it seems inconceivable it will not eventually be rolled out to consumers as well.\n\nAnd there is one more trick. For those complaining about Windows 10\u2019s extensive user tracking through telemetry (some of which [cannot be disabled](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/11/02/microsoft-confirms-unstoppable-windows-10-tracking/)) putting them off upgrading, Microsoft has a solution: it has retroactively installed all [the same user tracking](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/08/30/windows-10-spying-on-windows-7-and-windows-8/) on Windows 7 and Windows 8 so this is no longer a reason to avoid upgrading!\n\n**The Increasingly Impossible Choice**\n\nAll of which leaves Windows 7 and Windows 8 users in the following situation:\n\n* Invalidating their support if they upgrade their current computers or buy new computers\n\n* Seeing continual Windows 10 upgrade prompts which reinstall themselves if disabled\n\n* Facing automatically starting installation attempts every time they reboot their computer\n\n* Permanently giving up 6GB of their hard drive space to hold the Windows 10 installation files (typically it redownloads if removed)\n\n* Accepting the same user tracking and data logging behaviour as Windows 10\n\nA simple monetary figure cannot be tagged onto these such restrictions, nagging or tracking but for those using Windows 7 and Windows 8 on a daily basis ([currently 65% of the world\u2019s computers](https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0)) the cost is extremely high.\n\nOf course Microsoft has some marketing rhetoric here saying it allows users to roll back to Windows 7 or Windows 8 from Windows 10 if they don\u2019t like the experience.

Guess how long that lasted... Switching from Windows to Linux was somewhat frustrating at times, because I had to relearn stuff I could do in my sleep on Windows, and just installing a printer can be trying, and all my (modest) programming skills were based on Microsoft APIs.\n\n\nBut the installed printer keeps working, even through years of OS upgrades the printer remains supported.

Here it is:\n\n**Latest iPhone Rumors Suggest Apple May Make Another Big Break From Past**\n\n*With the rollout of the iPhone SE, it\u2019s clear Apple is no longer beholden to its old iPhone release schedule of \u201cnew models only in the fall, older models rolling off the price list in 2 years.\u201d But if Apple\u2019s top Wall Street analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, the company is set to make an even bigger break with past behavior come this fall. The KGI Securities analyst, in a report obtained by Mac Rumors, suggests Apple is going to launch a massive overhaul of the iPhone with a 5.8-inch OLED screen and a curved glass front and back. But that overhaul won\u2019t come until 2017, while 2016\u2032s iPhone 7 will be substantially similar to the current design.*\n\n***Breaking from the past***\n\n*Sorting out all the rumors, this means this fall\u2019s model would deviate from a pattern that iPhone has followed for the past 6 years. Specifically, Apple rolls out a new design in the even year and then substantially upgrades the internals in the odd years. We\u2019ve seen this with iPhone 4, 5, and 6 each sporting substantial changes to the physical nature of the phone \u2014 most importantly in screen size with the past two generations.*\n\n*A number of recent rumors have suggested iPhone 7 will do little design-wise to deviate from the 6 and 6s other than to drop the headphone jack, become even thinner and perhaps gain a second speaker. There have also been suggestions that an improved camera module will no longer protrude from the back of the phone even as it slims down. While this subtle a change seems unlikely, it\u2019s safe to say a few months ago few would have been easily persuaded Apple would take the design from the 3 1/2-year-old iPhone 5, pump it full of 6s technology and sell it for $50 less than the iPhone 5s. But that\u2019s exactly what the SE is.*\n\n***Leaping ahead later?***\n\n*The idea that Apple would do a more subtly refined iPhone 7 only for a year then roll out a more substantial upgrade in 2017 is given somewhat more weight by the claim the 2017 model would be limited to the larger screen \u201cPlus\u201d form factor, at least at first. Kuo goes even further, suggesting that limited availability of the 5.8-inch screens might cause Apple to keep both the 4.7-inch and 5-5-inch sizes along with it.*\n\n*That claim is absurd. OLED availability is already strong globally and will only be stronger a year from now. Apple doesn\u2019t sell that so many Plus models of the current year\u2019s phone that it would have trouble acquiring supply of screens if a decision has been made to build an OLED phone next year.*\n"], [17, "I installed adblocker just now so I could complain about Forbes"], [11, "Turn off my Adblock?

The KGI Securities analyst, in a report obtained by Mac Rumors, suggests Apple is going to launch a massive overhaul of the iPhone with a 5.8-inch OLED screen and a curved glass front and back. But that overhaul won\u2019t come until 2017, while 2016\u2032s iPhone 7 will be substantially similar to the current design.*\n\n***Breaking from the past***\n\n*Sorting out all the rumors, this means this fall\u2019s model would deviate from a pattern that iPhone has followed for the past 6 years. Specifically, Apple rolls out a new design in the even year and then substantially upgrades the internals in the odd years. We\u2019ve seen this with iPhone 4, 5, and 6 each sporting substantial changes to the physical nature of the phone \u2014 most importantly in screen size with the past two generations.*\n\n*A number of recent rumors have suggested iPhone 7 will do little design-wise to deviate from the 6 and 6s other than to drop the headphone jack, become even thinner and perhaps gain a second speaker. There have also been suggestions that an improved camera module will no longer protrude from the back of the phone even as it slims down. While this subtle a change seems unlikely, it\u2019s safe to say a few months ago few would have been easily persuaded Apple would take the design from the 3 1/2-year-old iPhone 5, pump it full of 6s technology and sell it for $50 less than the iPhone 5s. But that\u2019s exactly what the SE is.*\n\n***Leaping ahead later?***\n\n*The idea that Apple would do a more subtly refined iPhone 7 only for a year then roll out a more substantial upgrade in 2017 is given somewhat more weight by the claim the 2017 model would be limited to the larger screen \u201cPlus\u201d form factor, at least at first. Kuo goes even further, suggesting that limited availability of the 5.8-inch screens might cause Apple to keep both the 4.7-inch and 5-5-inch sizes along with it.*\n\n*That claim is absurd. OLED availability is already strong globally and will only be stronger a year from now. Apple doesn\u2019t sell that so many Plus models of the current year\u2019s phone that it would have trouble acquiring supply of screens if a decision has been made to build an OLED phone next year.*\n", "id": "d1f9sf6"}, {"comment": "Thanks for posting.

Are you people never happy?... What would you have them do ?... I mean seriously?... \n\nApple overtly states (in their recent WWDC video \"How iOS Security Really Works\": https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2016/  at approx the 4m 56s marker)... that they believe the 3 pillars of iOS security are:\n\n* iOS platform security architecture itself\n* End-Users installing their updates in a timely manner\n* Developers following good security practices when designing/writing Apps\n\nIn this day and age (2016).. where technology is evolving quickly and security-exploits are discovered on a fairly regular basis,.. I'm not sure how any company could be faulted for pushing out regular patches/updates. Compared to the fragmentation of Android,.. where lots of handset-manufacturers never approve the updates **AT ALL** ... that makes the way Apple does it look positively modern and sensible. \n\n> \"Annual OS upgrades (yes UPGRADES, not updates), so it's like switching from Windows XP, to Vista, to 7, to 8, to 8.1 to 10 on a annual cycle instead of every three years...\"\n\nAnd what's the problem here?.... Each point-release for OSX contains upwards of 200 to 300 (or more) feature-improvements and underlying architecture improvements. El Capitan is supported on everything back to \"Late 2007\" and the newer (beta) Sierra is supported on everything back to 2010 models (nearly 6 years). \n\n> \"if you want to or not\"\n\nOSX updates are not forced.

Apple's official \"Vintage and Obsolete Products\" page (source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 ) lists hardware going back nearly 6 or 7 years. And as I mentioned before,.. versions of OSX such as El Capitan are supported as far back as \"Late 2007\" and the upcoming Sierra is supported on everything back to 2010 (nearly 6 years).

People want stability with their products so it solves a problem, not subject themselves to something that requires constant attention over.\n\nThey do the complete operating system changes annually because that way they can cause older hardware (anything considered over 3 years old in Apple's view) to slow down and/or become obsolete.\n\nSure Apple is supporting older Intel processors now, provided they are 64 bit, but they quickly abandoned PPC and 32 bit Intel and all those users. Microsoft supports a 32 bit version of Windows 10, their latest version. Apple doesn't.\n\nIf Intel comes out with another processor architecture, Apple will abandon the 64 bit Intel users rather quickly also.\n\nPeople learn about getting burned by Apple and they don't return. So Apple can only survive on new suckers or those rich enough not to care.\n\nDo you see Apple products being deployed on a major scale in businesses around the world? Heck no, it's because their hardware and software turnover rate is too high.\n\nOnly a few that can afford it, like Google, or in an arrangement like IBM, deploys Apple hardware, then likely at a huge discount to make it worthwhile.\n\n\n[**\"If I were running Apple, I would milk the Macintosh for all it's worth \u2014 and get busy on the next great thing.

It was tiny little steps.\n\nActually, no, it did pretty much happen all at once and that's one of the biggest criticisms of the novel. \n\nIf you look at 1984 it's definetly hinted that WW2 happened pretty much as it did in our reality, and it was likely he was heavily influenced by the state of the world in 1945 (he started writing in 1944, published it in 1946).\n\nBasically at some point after WW2 our timelines diverge and IngSoc (the English Socialism party) managed to perform some sort of socialist coup. \n\nIts heavily implied throughout the novel that the party seized power as a specialist party, similar to how the communists seized power in Russia. \n\nThere was only 40 years between the point from which Orwell finished writing the novel to the present day (in the novel), and there is some undefined amount of time between WW2 and IngSoc's coup.\n\nThere's no hint at all that all this is a recent development in the novels, and Winton is in his 40s having been a small child during the war. He cannot remember a time where things were not like they are in the novel. He vaguely remembers a different time when he was a small child (1940-1950 say) but he's grown up under the watchful eye of Big Brother and the Party. \n\nSo basically it was a coup, the new Government seized power and set about keeping it ASAP. Proles were kept in a state of living hand to mouth and being relatively content and under educated, the middle classes were spied upon relentlessly, and the upper classes kept themselves busy killing each other off (making sure that while they don't mind rocking the boat, they don't want to capsize it). \n\nIts why 1984 is a poor comparison for the modern world. The probability of a government being overthrown and implementing 1984esque surveillance and laws is pretty minimal. \n\nBrave New World on the other hand, a novel written prior to 1984,  is a much more worrying and accurate depiction of a totalitarian regime. \n\nA cabal of the international elite get together and decide that something must be done to ensure everyone on the planet can lead happy lives. They start brainwashing people to be happy with what they have in life and genetically engineering people to fit their position on a scale, similar to how we measure society now: A-B-C1-C2-D-E. People are kept content with free drugs and games and casual sex. People who are too clever or don't fit the mold are shipped off to overseas colonies where they aren't mistreated but they certainly aren't free. \n\nThese changes were brought it gradually though, including several wars where WMDs were used on those resisting. Genetic production of children wasn't brought in immediately, but over time. \n\nTL;DR is that 1984 is an outdated reference to how a totalitarian state would be formed. Orwell imagined ingsoc as a party of a revolution who implemented it's form of government immediately and tightens it's grip every year using fear and constant control and secret police. \n\nBrave New World on the other hand shows a world government that grew over time, with theoretically laudable goals but in practice makes everyone  slaves (albeit happy ones thanks to their genetics, brainwashing and distractions). \n\n", "id": "d0z5chh"}, {"comment": "Yeah, that's why I think Brave New World is much more effective as a piece of dystopian literature.

Big Brother's society is one of total control over the individual, which comes at the expense of a society that's actually worth having total control over.\n\nImagine having total control over a society in which every member is deathly afraid of Big Brother and of giving offence that will be severely punished. That society achieves 0. You're done. Big Brother is now watching scared sheep who do nothing every day, except the allowed and allotted jobs. And that's it. If anyone commits 'an offence' it's something that is so utterly trivial as to being banal and hardly worth mentioning. But, because you're Big Brother, the only 'reasonable' response is ridiculous amounts of punishment to reinforce the total control of Big Brother.\n\nBig Brother then becomes the fantasy land of the kid who doesn't want to share the doll house. This society produces nothing worth having. The people who are the free thinkers kill themselves rather than to live in some prepubescent pipe dream. The people who are afraid to kill themselves sit in rooms all day, being scared of Big Brother. What does a society like that produce? -Nothing-.\n\n- Economic output tanks\n\n- Childbirths fall off a cliff\n\n- Nobody does -anything- that's not demanded by Big Brother\n\n- Because of Newspeak people also don't have the vocabulary to express complex ideas. So, complex ideas are no longer expressed. You can't, you literally don't have the words for them. And with that any exciting, useful, wonderful idea dies. You have a society of people who would need to relearn the words to define what it is they are feeling [or create new ones].\n\nSo, as Big Brother you won. Big time. Everybody's afraid. Yay you! You're the ruler of a society in which nothing happens. Is that something worth having? Because: everything that's 'good' would have to come from outside where people are free to make it. Everything in your own society is shit. Big Brother also does not explain how anyone would be smart enough to make and maintain the technology to suppress the people. The technology to watch bored people be boring the live long day, because they're afraid to do something. That's what that is. I have thought about that for a bit and I cannot possibly imagine what Big Brother gets out of that that is worth having.\n\nWhere would you get your successor class from? You'd have to tap into a pool of very few super plus good influential individuals. And they have nothing to do either. Because the people are not generating anything worth joining. No music, no art, no literature, nothing worth looking at, not even a bar to go to, or an ice cream parlour. You're a member of the over privileged class who lives a shit life because everybody else is having a shit life [but then, they would have 'enclaves' where outside influences, up to a point, would [have to] be tolerated].

They are always the man-in-the-middle.* Your ISP has been able to view your unencrypted traffic since there was such a thing as an ISP. This has always been the case. I repeat, **nothing new is happening here**.\n\nAre they decrypting any secured traffic? No. I bet that if you built a VPN tunnel through their network (which is very easy to do these days, even for a layman), you would not see these \"ads\".\n\nThey are not ads, by the way. They are notifications on the obsolescence of customer equipment. It is a net loss for both the customer and the ISP when customers continue to use obsolete equipment such as DOCSIS 2.0 modems. The customer suffers from a degraded experience. The ISP suffers increased labor and maintenance costs due to having to maintain a network to support obsolete equipment, as well as the labor cost of support calls when customers who do not know their equipment is obsolete end up calling tech support to complain about performance issues.\n\nThere is nothing malicious going on here. **To be able to label something a MITM \"attack\" there has to be some kind of malicious intent.** What you are suggesting is analogous to saying that EMS entering my home to save my life is \"breaking and entering\" and a \"crime\". While technically true, it's foolish and narrow-minded, and the truly irritating thing about it, is that it's purposefully foolish and narrow-minded. You know what a true MITM attack is (or at least I assume you do, and that you're not just ignorantly pelting me with Wikipedia articles...), yet you're using this concocted narrative to feed the Comcast pitchfork brigade.\n\nAgain, Comcast is trying to be proactive about getting DOCSIS 2.0 modems off of their network, for the benefit of all.

Congress created a law that created the FTC that gave the FTC the power to promulgate regulations. Sometimes administrative bodies do promulgate regulations (which typically require things like notice, public comment, etc. to be valid). Sometimes administrative bodies are giving *their interpretation* of a law or regulation. That interpretation may be persuasive, but is not necessarily binding on a court later handling the case. \n\nAs an example, I do some employment law work. You can go on the DOL's website and read their interpretation letters and they'll tell you all sorts of things you need to do that you actually don't. They (and many other administrative agencies) typically go for the broadest interpretation that gives them the most power. That doesn't mean their interpretation will hold up. The process of an administrative body creating binding law isn't as simple as updating a website.\n\nSo I look at something like this and I wonder - is this them putting an actual regulation they have (that makes the distinction between disclosure in the video and disclosure below the video) into plain English? Is this their interpretation of the law? Or is this something even less, just \"best practice\" guidelines that are just supposed to help people out (and have no binding effect)? My guess is its somewhere in the middle. I bet they have a law that says you have to have \"disclosure\" and this is their interpretation that says \"disclosure below the video doesn't count for disclosure.\" But if they ever tried to enforce that they could be in for an uphill battle convincing a judge.\n \nNotably, this is announcing a settlement between Warner Bros. and the FTC. The terms of the settlement sound like Warner Bros. agreed not to do it again. No financial penalty of any kind. That sounds like a win for Warner Bros., probably because the FTC didn't want to take their \"it has to be in the video\" argument into court.

But that's the direction that Dave Palmer, director of technology at cybersecurity firm Darktrace, thinks the arms race between hackers and security firms is heading.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more and more sophisticated, Palmer told Business Insider in an interview at the FT Cybersecurity Summit in London in September, it will inevitably find its way into malware \u2014 with potentially disastrous results for the businesses and individuals that hackers target.\n\nIt's important to remember that Palmer is in the security business: It's his job to hype up the threats out there (present and future), and convince customers that Darktrace is the only one that can save them. It's a $500 million (\u00a3401 million) British firm, with an AI-driven approach to defend networks. It creates an \"immune system\" for customers that learns how businesses operate then monitors for potential irregularities.\n\nBut with that in mind, Palmer provides an fascinating insight into how one of the buzziest young companies in the industry thinks cybersecurity is going to evolve.\n\nSmart viruses will hold industrial equipment to ransom\nmri brain scan\nWant to use that MRI scanner again? Cough up some bitcoin. Vimeo/JonO\nRansomware is endemic right now. It's a type of malware that encrypts everything on the victim's computer or network, then demands a bitcoin ransom to decrypt it. If they don't pay up in a set timeframe, the data is lost for good.\n\nAI-infused ransomware could turbo-charge the risks these attacks make \u2014 self-organising to inflict maximum damage, and going after new, even more lucrative targets.\n\n\"[We'll] see coordinated action. So imagine ransomware waiting until it's spread across a number of areas of the network before it suddenly takes action,\" Palmer said.\n\n\"I'm convinced we'll see the extortion of assets as well as data. So factory equipment, MRI scanners in hospitals, retail equipment \u2014 stuff that you'd pay to have back online because you can't actually function as a business without it. Data's one thing and you can back that up, but if your machine stops working then you're not going to be making any more money.\"\n\nMalware will learn to mimic people you know\ndeepmind alphago round two lee sedol go\nGoogle has taught neural network AI to play Go \u2014 but the tech could also be used for far more nefarious ends. Mustafa Suleyman/Twitter\nUsing recurring neural networks, it's already possible to teach AI software to mimic writing styles \u2014 whether that's clickbait viral news articles or editorial columns from The Guardian. Palmer suggests that in the future, malware will be able to look through your correspondence, learn how you communicate, and then mimic you in order to infect other targets.\n\n\"Nadia's got something on her laptop that can read all her emails, reads her messages, can read her calendar, and then sends people messages in the same communication style she uses with them. So Nadia's always very rude to me so she'll send jokey messages ... but to you she'll be extremely polite. So you would receive, maybe, a map of this location of where to meet from Nadia \u2014 because it can see in her calendar that we're due to meet. And you'd open it, because it'd be relevant, it'd be contextual \u2014 but that map would have a payload attached to it.\"\n\nIt's like a more sophisticated version of a \"CFO email\" scam or \"trust attack\" \u2014 where a scammer, purporting to be a company employee, sends an email to the target asking them to make a money transfer.

Fallon\nIn December 2015, a Ukrainian power station was knocked offline by an unprecedented hack. 80,000 people lost power as a result, and Russian state-sponsored hackers are believed to be responsible. It's a spectacular example of how vulnerable the modern world is to hack attacks \u2014 but Palmer thinks the most destructive hacks in the future may be far less visible.\n\n\"If you can disable an oil rig, people are going to notice. Everyone's going to get around to trying to fix it.

", "id": "d8jdxno"}], [{"comment": "Imagine you've got a meeting with a client, and shortly before you leave, they send you over a confirmation and a map with directions to where you're planning to meet.\n\nIt all looks normal \u2014 but the entire message was actually written by a piece of smart malware mimicking the client's email mannerisms, with a virus attached to the map.\n\nIt sounds pretty far out \u2014 and it is, for now. But that's the direction that Dave Palmer, director of technology at cybersecurity firm Darktrace, thinks the arms race between hackers and security firms is heading.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more and more sophisticated, Palmer told Business Insider in an interview at the FT Cybersecurity Summit in London in September, it will inevitably find its way into malware \u2014 with potentially disastrous results for the businesses and individuals that hackers target.\n\nIt's important to remember that Palmer is in the security business: It's his job to hype up the threats out there (present and future), and convince customers that Darktrace is the only one that can save them. It's a $500 million (\u00a3401 million) British firm, with an AI-driven approach to defend networks. It creates an \"immune system\" for customers that learns how businesses operate then monitors for potential irregularities.\n\nBut with that in mind, Palmer provides an fascinating insight into how one of the buzziest young companies in the industry thinks cybersecurity is going to evolve.\n\nSmart viruses will hold industrial equipment to ransom\nmri brain scan\nWant to use that MRI scanner again? Cough up some bitcoin. Vimeo/JonO\nRansomware is endemic right now. It's a type of malware that encrypts everything on the victim's computer or network, then demands a bitcoin ransom to decrypt it. If they don't pay up in a set timeframe, the data is lost for good.\n\nAI-infused ransomware could turbo-charge the risks these attacks make \u2014 self-organising to inflict maximum damage, and going after new, even more lucrative targets.\n\n\"[We'll] see coordinated action. So imagine ransomware waiting until it's spread across a number of areas of the network before it suddenly takes action,\" Palmer said.\n\n\"I'm convinced we'll see the extortion of assets as well as data. So factory equipment, MRI scanners in hospitals, retail equipment \u2014 stuff that you'd pay to have back online because you can't actually function as a business without it. Data's one thing and you can back that up, but if your machine stops working then you're not going to be making any more money.\"\n\nMalware will learn to mimic people you know\ndeepmind alphago round two lee sedol go\nGoogle has taught neural network AI to play Go \u2014 but the tech could also be used for far more nefarious ends. Mustafa Suleyman/Twitter\nUsing recurring neural networks, it's already possible to teach AI software to mimic writing styles \u2014 whether that's clickbait viral news articles or editorial columns from The Guardian. Palmer suggests that in the future, malware will be able to look through your correspondence, learn how you communicate, and then mimic you in order to infect other targets.\n\n\"Nadia's got something on her laptop that can read all her emails, reads her messages, can read her calendar, and then sends people messages in the same communication style she uses with them. So Nadia's always very rude to me so she'll send jokey messages ... but to you she'll be extremely polite. So you would receive, maybe, a map of this location of where to meet from Nadia \u2014 because it can see in her calendar that we're due to meet. And you'd open it, because it'd be relevant, it'd be contextual \u2014 but that map would have a payload attached to it.\"\n\nIt's like a more sophisticated version of a \"CFO email\" scam or \"trust attack\" \u2014 where a scammer, purporting to be a company employee, sends an email to the target asking them to make a money transfer. The FBI estimates that such attacks have cost businesses $2.3 billion (\u00a31.84 billion) over the last three years.\n\nThe worst hacks won't be the most noticeable ones\nexplosions drill airport plane transport disaster\nDon't expect fireworks from the most devastating hacks of the future. They'll be in the background, insidious and unseen. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon\nIn December 2015, a Ukrainian power station was knocked offline by an unprecedented hack. 80,000 people lost power as a result, and Russian state-sponsored hackers are believed to be responsible. It's a spectacular example of how vulnerable the modern world is to hack attacks \u2014 but Palmer thinks the most destructive hacks in the future may be far less visible.\n\n\"If you can disable an oil rig, people are going to notice. Everyone's going to get around to trying to fix it. If you really wanted to try and harm an oil and gas firm, to my mind what you would do is have your self-hunting, self-targeting malware go in there and then start to change the geophysical data on which they decide where they're going to buy mining rights.

What they do instead is they ask related questions to encourage the response they're seeking. \n\nFor instance, a Republican poll wouldn't ask voters in a swing state whether they'd vote for Hillary or Trump. Instead, they ask what voters think about Hillary's track record in Benghazi, something which the majority of people don't have a clue about but have an opinion on. Then they ask whether Trump would make a difference in the White House. Obviously they know that since people know he's brash and tactless, people would view him as less prone to corruption.

First red flag. \n\nSecondly, most people don't understand how these surveys work. When a poll that is sponsored by an organization is conducted, it rarely asks plainly whether you like A or B. What they do instead is they ask related questions to encourage the response they're seeking. \n\nFor instance, a Republican poll wouldn't ask voters in a swing state whether they'd vote for Hillary or Trump. Instead, they ask what voters think about Hillary's track record in Benghazi, something which the majority of people don't have a clue about but have an opinion on. Then they ask whether Trump would make a difference in the White House. Obviously they know that since people know he's brash and tactless, people would view him as less prone to corruption. So you have a box checked against Hillary and another box checked for Trump. Get a majority of boxes checked in a \"gerrymandered\" category, and you can summarize it as people preferring Trump to Hillary. \n\nI'd bet my firstborn child that this is exactly the kind of shenanigans going in. Obviously the sponsor of the campaign has a vested interest in getting people to vote against daylight. Plus the margin is only 5%, 64% for daylight vs 69% for Internet. What's the standard deviation on that? \n\nFurthermore, there are other ways to get the result you want. What constitutes young people? An 18 year old living in an orphan's home who has never experienced Internet is a young person. A refugee father who has just immigrated from Syria is also a young person. \n\nI'd wager that the list of options they allow you to pick from is also grotesquely skewed; they probably deliberately included something nonsensical like radio controlled cars that they know people wouldn't pick and omit breathing for instance to raise the profile of the choices they were aiming for. \n\nI mean, just ask yourself.

Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.

Preliminary inquiry points to multiple failures in design, hardware and software. After the launch it was discovered that the star tracker stabilization didn't work in a low magnetic flux area over the South Atlantic. When the backup gyroscopic spin stabilization took control, the spin increased instead of stopping. An internal magnetic limit feature in the gyroscope failed, causing the spin get worse. Finally, a thruster based control started, but because of a software failure the spin increased further. The solar panels broke off, leaving the satellite without a long-term power supply. It seems that untested software had been uploaded for thrust control just before the breakup. This is a major loss for astronomical research. Two previous attempts by Japan to launch a high-resolution X-ray calorimeter had also failed, and the next planned sensor of this type is not scheduled until 2028 by the ESA.

I'm pretty sure Apple remains the only computer company still growing in the market. Take away all if iPhone sales, and Apple is still a profitable, multi-billion dollar company. The fact that they have become debatably the biggest tech company in the industry in the process is icing on the cake."], [1, "Very interesting parallels. Obviously no one can say what the future holds but it's entirely plausible that, in spite of their continued growth, Apples golden age is over and they're just in a juggernaut phase now which will eventually peak and reverse direction. That wouldn't surprise me in the least. But it's far from guaranteed. Two key differences I see that could drastically change that:\n\nApple has actually been making a lot of long term bets on development. The short side of this is that they look pretty stagnant in both hardware (yearly iterations, and entirely predictable new products that are purely market demand reactions, absolutely nothing \"new\"), and software (iterative improvements on all platforms). However behind the scenes they have been making HUGE bets on future technologies (all the stuff related to cars we are only hearing whispers of the first drafts of the concepts, Siri is crap, but it's handled as a core technology with low level integration across all platforms, etc). They're not playing the hand they have, they're playing the hand they hope to have in 5 years (when self driving cars are viable, when speech recognition is practical and not just a gimmick, etc). That is of course all a bet... If it doesn't pan out they're not getting ahead of anyone, but they have the resources to try, high ver few others do.\n\nVR is widely agreed to be the next world changing tech, and it's right around the corner (less than a month) from hitting 1.0 for consumers. The general consensus is that the future of vr will be built on mobile type hardware. Apples dominance with the iPhone shows they know a few things about getting it made and getting it sold. No one knows if they can get it designed and working of course, but again, they have resources few others have. They also have a history of letting others make the early mistakes, and then come in later with the genre defining product (see GUI, MP3 players, smart phones, tablets, ultra portable laptops, etc.). They probably won't release anything for a number of years, but when they do it will likely be designed around other companies mistakes, with the aim of taking over the public perception of what VR means. And they will produce it in volume, and at a \"premium\". But not too expensive price point.\n\nMicrosoft is trying some related moves, but they're held back by corporate structure, bulk, and a lack of direction. Things like holo lense sound amazing but in the light of day are really just engineering experiments (too expensive, not practical due to technical limitations, and no clear way to improve either problem in the short or medium term). Windows 10, with its associated metric gathering tools and aggressive push to grow user base by rapidly phasing out older OS versions is a pretty blatant attempt to gather Facebook/Google types of raw data for value, and App Store like controlled revenue and distribution streams. If it works they're in a pretty sweet position, but both of those goals are directly offensive to their typical true source of income, which is enterprise and government. Consumers are small potatoes when you can sell bulk licenses. And those bulk buyers specifically can't afford to let the metrics out (security) and can't afford to the the App Store directly (IT nightmares and costs, side note: Apple has a totally separate app distribution system for enterprise customers for iOS specifically to address this type of thing). Time will tell if they can live out their new Machiavellian dreams of total comouter domination, or if they finally shot themselves in the foot one too many times, and opened the door for Linux or some other new player in the enterprise, etc. space.\n\nSo just some thoughts. Also keep in mind we love in the future, and the world changes quick.  Facebook dominates so many things now and just a few years ago they didn't even really exist... As hard as it is to imagine Microsoft, or Apple, Bing replaced, it could happen Ina just a few years from a player we've never even heard of yet."], [1, "The main difference between Microsoft of the past and present-day Apple is that Microsoft tried a lot of new things which all failed and Apple is trying a few new things which are successes.\n\nI don't think we have any sales data for the new Apple TV, though, but the watch is doing very well."], [1, "for one, MS had mobile products in the late 1990's but they never sold very well even with some geeky hits along the way. except for the apple TV, what is out there that apple is missing?\n\nonly thing i can think of is TV and how the set top boxes will go away in a few years"], [1, "It's not that hard to imagine Ballmer in a dog collar playing the submissive for fun.

Obviously no one can say what the future holds but it's entirely plausible that, in spite of their continued growth, Apples golden age is over and they're just in a juggernaut phase now which will eventually peak and reverse direction. That wouldn't surprise me in the least. But it's far from guaranteed. Two key differences I see that could drastically change that:\n\nApple has actually been making a lot of long term bets on development. The short side of this is that they look pretty stagnant in both hardware (yearly iterations, and entirely predictable new products that are purely market demand reactions, absolutely nothing \"new\"), and software (iterative improvements on all platforms). However behind the scenes they have been making HUGE bets on future technologies (all the stuff related to cars we are only hearing whispers of the first drafts of the concepts, Siri is crap, but it's handled as a core technology with low level integration across all platforms, etc). They're not playing the hand they have, they're playing the hand they hope to have in 5 years (when self driving cars are viable, when speech recognition is practical and not just a gimmick, etc). That is of course all a bet... If it doesn't pan out they're not getting ahead of anyone, but they have the resources to try, high ver few others do.\n\nVR is widely agreed to be the next world changing tech, and it's right around the corner (less than a month) from hitting 1.0 for consumers. The general consensus is that the future of vr will be built on mobile type hardware. Apples dominance with the iPhone shows they know a few things about getting it made and getting it sold. No one knows if they can get it designed and working of course, but again, they have resources few others have. They also have a history of letting others make the early mistakes, and then come in later with the genre defining product (see GUI, MP3 players, smart phones, tablets, ultra portable laptops, etc.). They probably won't release anything for a number of years, but when they do it will likely be designed around other companies mistakes, with the aim of taking over the public perception of what VR means. And they will produce it in volume, and at a \"premium\". But not too expensive price point.\n\nMicrosoft is trying some related moves, but they're held back by corporate structure, bulk, and a lack of direction. Things like holo lense sound amazing but in the light of day are really just engineering experiments (too expensive, not practical due to technical limitations, and no clear way to improve either problem in the short or medium term). Windows 10, with its associated metric gathering tools and aggressive push to grow user base by rapidly phasing out older OS versions is a pretty blatant attempt to gather Facebook/Google types of raw data for value, and App Store like controlled revenue and distribution streams. If it works they're in a pretty sweet position, but both of those goals are directly offensive to their typical true source of income, which is enterprise and government. Consumers are small potatoes when you can sell bulk licenses. And those bulk buyers specifically can't afford to let the metrics out (security) and can't afford to the the App Store directly (IT nightmares and costs, side note: Apple has a totally separate app distribution system for enterprise customers for iOS specifically to address this type of thing). Time will tell if they can live out their new Machiavellian dreams of total comouter domination, or if they finally shot themselves in the foot one too many times, and opened the door for Linux or some other new player in the enterprise, etc. space.\n\nSo just some thoughts. Also keep in mind we love in the future, and the world changes quick.  Facebook dominates so many things now and just a few years ago they didn't even really exist...

It certainly seems clear Apple is making some long terms bets. As was Microsoft throughout the reign of Ballmer. Sometimes it's easy to forget that Microsoft has been spending around $10 billion per year on R&D for the last 15 years! Apple's investment in R&D have been a fraction of that, so here's hoping they have a better strike rate. What seems clear is that the pace of major technology innovation seems to be speeding up. So the time between major tech shifts seems to be shrinking. There is no question Apple is in the prime position to dominate the next generational shift. It's shaping up to be a fascinating battle of the Titans, between Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. And maybe a new player will emerge. But i see some disturbing parallels with Microsoft under Ballmer and Apple under Tim Cook. Tim Cook seems to be a great leader and manager. But he doesn't seem to be the tech visionary in the same vein as Larry Page, Jeff Bezos or even Satya Nadella or Mark Zuckerberg. So yes, its going to be very interesting. Apple holds it's cards close to its chest, so we don't know what they are working on. But the danger for Apple is the same danger MS faced - sometimes if you are not out front, playing catch-up doesn't work. Microsoft Phone was a perfectly good platform with some good hardware. But once they surrendered leadership to Google and Apple, it was impossible for them to catch up. So Apple cannot afford to take the arrogant approach of saying in each market, we will come in late and them dominate.

MS likes to think of itself as a giant that can crush anyone (as they used to be), while Apple likes to think of itself as a plucky startup that pushes the boundries (as they used to be). Their internal structures, hiring practices, and project management schemes relate to this, which I think is part of MS's fall (when people no longer care about what they offer, and each version of office is worse than the last due to just trying to extend a bulleted list of features no one wants, it's hard to maintain momentum. this is also where apple is headed to some degree, new iPhone is always meh, iwatch was just made to fill a gap in the market, no one cares, etc.).  The counter point with apple is that they start and abandon projects all the time, far more speculative work, which opens the door for discovery at lower levels rather than everything being an edict from upper management, based purely on marketing data (gross over simplification there).\n\nI've been an Apple supporter since OS 7 (not iOS7, Mac OS 7), and I've always hated the windows UI, so I've definitely got a dog in this fight.

Windows 10 on the other hand (setting aside it's core of pure greed and evil...) is the first version of windows ever that I can actually use daily without getting pissed at it. But then again, lets not forget that Apple is still \"sexy\" to the consumer (where the money comes from), and it wasn't very long ago that windows 8 tried to take us back to the glory days of AOL, only on the desktop now!.

Everything they have done up until now has been small timid steps. They release late last year the new Apple TV and called it \"The Future of Television\".

With 200 billion cash, if Apple wanted to change the face of TV, they could have. That's what is disappointing to me.

Planning for the future, or doing anything to expedite the future risks their current proffits so they're likely quite hostile no matter how good the offer might be. I think Jobs tried to bully his way in and probably got thrown right back out by people who straight up don't care. I think Cook probably made bigger in-roads specifically because he lacked that force of personality. But, at this time, I think it's an un-crackable egg.\n\nWhen you counter this with Netflix's approach which is to bypass the existing players entirely, Apple clearly hasn't been willing to play that game. It does sound foolish to forego all the existing content out there and just hunt for scraps (like netflix did at first with bulk licensing of meh movies), but Netflix has kind of proven that an end run around the established players entirely, which is putting them in a dominant position going into the next wave of home entertainment.\n\nThe way for Apple to make that happens is to buy big. Buy a valuable TV content creation source. CBS, Discovery Networks, whatever, a big chunk of the TV content core. Then use that to threaten the whole TV bundling ecosystem.

Even above Russian and Chinese mail providers. Google knows they can be irresponsible and pass off such abuse as a \"margin of error\" (which for an organization like Google is millions of email addresses) and not get blacklisted because nobody can afford to say \"No\" to them without losing a huge swath of communication. Spammers know it too and is why they choose Gmail for bulk registration.\n\nNothing else comes close and they outright enable it with their \"dots are meaningless in Gmail usernames\" policy where a spammer could auto-register \"abcdef-example@gmail.com\" at Gmail and then proceed to register ~50-100 accounts to a forum using that same account by throwing dots in at various points: \"abcdef-exam.ple@gmail.com\", \"abc.d.e.f-example@gmail.com\", etc, etc. and it goes unquestioned.

As someone who has owned the DK1-CV1 and the Vive, the importance of forgetting the HMD during your experience can't be understated.  The Vive doesn't even try to compete with the Rift's new ergonomics (Vive uses the three-strap system of past HMDs vs Rift's rigid \"hat\"-like ergonomics that 'save' your fine adjustments) and it is night and day for long usage scenarios.  You have to adjust the Vive every time you put it on, and this can take time.  The Rift's straps are rigid and will be a 100% perfect fit after you adjust once.  This will be the toughest thing to give up selling my Rift  \n\n-  Rift's screen quality is better.  It uses 100% the same panel as the Vive, but hits the better balance between FOV and pixel fill.  Vive has a greater FOV but it's such a miniscule difference you won't notice.  You will, however, notice the screen door effect on the Vive much more.  I also prefer the lenses of the Rift, but both HMDs have pros/cons with the lenses so this point is much more subjective.  \n\n- Headphones.   Vive really screwed the pooch leaving these out of the HMD.  Experiences designed for the Rift can target a single set of headphones in order to best recreate sound experiences, and, more importantly, it's one less set of wires to deal with as they are built-into the headset. This might not sound like a big deal to new users, but after using a DK1/DK2 for years, I'll be god damned if I ever go back to the hellish squid-wrestling-simulator that is dealing with separate cables for the HMD and left and right audio.  Bluetooth headphones would help but it's hard to beat the simplicity of single-step \"put thing on head\" when using the Rift.\n", "id": "d81ei6a"}, {"comment": "Yeah, don't sell your Rift.

Photo: Reuters/Robert Galbraith\nMany Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and developers haven't taken too kindly to the news that Palmer Luckey \u2014 the 24-year-old co-founder of Oculus VR and creator of Oculus Rift \u2014 has been secretly backing a pro-Donald Trump group dedicated to \u201cshitposting\u201d and creating viral anti-Hillary Clinton memes.\n\n> According to several media reports, Luckey's anti-Clinton stance and speculation over his possible association with the prominent alt-right spokesman Milo Yiannopoulos \u2014 who was recently banned from Twitter for allegedly inciting trolls to verbally harass \"Ghostbusters\" actress Leslie Jones \u2014 has led several developers to distance themselves from the VR company.\n\n> \"Hey Oculus, Palmer Luckey's actions are unacceptable,\" Tomorrow Today Labs, a Seattle-based VR videos games company currently working on an unannounced VR game, wrote in a tweet Friday.\n\n\n> Scruta Games, another developer that employs VR, also voiced its discontent on Twitter, stating that it would cancel Oculus support for its games until Luckey steps down from his position at the company.\n\n\n> Indie developers Kokoromi and Polytron said they wouldn't provide Oculus support with their new game, SuperHyperCube. \n\n> \"In a political climate as fragile and horrifying as this one, we cannot tacitly endorse these actions by supporting Luckey or his platform,\" the companies said in a statement. \n\n> Meanwhile, Insomniac Games \u2014 which is currently working on three games for Oculus Rift \u2014 was more restrained in its response, even as it clarified that the \"behavior and sentiments reported do not reflect the values of our company.\"\n\n> \"We are also confident that this behavior and sentiment does not reflect the values of the many Oculus employees we work with on a daily basis,\" the company said. \u00a0\n\n> The developers' anger stems from a Daily Beast report on Friday, which revealed that Luckey, whose net worth is estimated at roughly $700 million, had funded and written for the pro-Trump group \u201cNimble America\u201d under the pseudonym \"NimbleRichMan.\" The organization, which, in a recent Reddit post said it had proven that \u201cshitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,\u201d has, among other things, taken credit for a billboard allegedly posted near Pittsburgh, showing an enlarged image of Clinton\u2019s face next to the words, \u201cToo Big to Jail.\u201d\n\n> \u201cShitposting\u201d refers to the practice of trying to derail online conversations by posting content that is defamatory, irrelevant, misleading or offensive.\n\n\n> After the publication of the report \u2014 and the ensuing backlash against Luckey \u2014 the Oculus founder released a statement that contradicted the Daily Beast's story.\n\n> \"I am committed to the principles of fair play and equal treatment. I did not write the \u2018NimbleRichMan\u2019 posts, nor did I delete the account,\" Luckey wrote in a Facebook post. \"I contributed $10,000 to Nimble America because I thought the organization had fresh ideas on how to communicate with young voters through the use of several billboards.

Listen to the point you are trying to make and see if it makes sense. Criminals already involved in committing a crime are going to use weak encryption to avoid jail time? No, that doesn't make sense. Unless the penalty for using strong encryption are more severe than the crime that is being committed (and admittedly I don't *know* that but I'm guessing the penalties, in general, for using encryption are far less severe than the crime committed ), criminals will use strong encryption. Note, I'm referring to criminals involved in crimes. I am not referring to people who are otherwise not involved in crimes other than using strong encryption.\n\n> The \"I'm not sure that's true\" referred to \"this only impacts law abiding people and companies because criminals by definition don't follow the law\".\n\nYep, and my point still holds. If the law says that using encryption with a key over 40 bits is illegal, then only law abiding people and companies--those that follow the law, that's what \"abide\" means--will use a very weak form of encryption that anyone including the government, other criminals, you or I, could easily and cheaply crack today.

Some perspective: even with an ideal register based computer operating at maximum efficiency as allowed by the laws of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, brute forcing a 128 bit key would require more energy than it would take to boil away the oceans. That's exponential growth for you! Now 256 bit is even worse, and is used mostly due to paranoia. If your cipher has a weakness which cuts its complexity in half, a 256 bit cipher is still equivalent to a 128 bit one, which is utterly infeasible to crack by a naive brute force attempt.\n\nIn fact, even an 80 bit key or so is likely to be secure against naive brute force attacks for many decades, and even then it would require a great deal of money and time to crack it.\n\nNote that this is before you consider additional safeguards, such as scrypt, which deliberately generates the keys with a slow and memory intensive algorithm. This is not much of a problem for the user, since you are unlikely to notice a half a second pause or so when logging in, but it severely complicates naive attacks against the password. Crucially, the scrypt algorithm was deliberately designed to be expensive to implement in hardware, and infeasibly to run on a GPU. It achieves this by generating a large array of data in a pseudo-random fashion, and then reading the array back into the algorithm in a similarly unpredictable way. The consequence is that any attempt to attack the algorithm requires each process to consume a substantial amount of memory, which is not typically a problem on a regular computer, but makes it much more expensive to implement in hardware.

If you hit this site, your browser was compromised and enough information to tie the connection to an individual computer was sent and hashed.  This is like the FBI setting up a store front with a sign which says, \"get your kiddie porn here\".  Then forcing anyone who shows up to hand over an ID.  Even without the kiddie porn angle, I think they did this the right way.  It's been pretty well demonstrated that an internet IP address isn't enough to identify a user or even a computer.  If just gets you back to the network edge device.  Hostname and MAC address does a reasonable job of uniquely identifying a machine.  Though, a MAC addresses can be spoofed, and I can't say if the FBI malware could be fooled.  \nThey also weren't going out and actively hacking people and searching computers like the NSA.

Still, it also unsettles me that, in addition to drug crime, we now have another category of \"possession crime\" that's based on information. It seems like it'd be the easiest thing in the world to frame someone for this. And the fact that people are profoundly uneasy about even speaking up for the due process rights of those accused of this crime makes it even more dangerous. It's an accusation that kills all on its own. It's like the Red Scare and accusations of being a communist. Except instead of fabricating reports of seeing someone talk to someone else, all you have to do is slip a few files onto a hard drive.\n\nI guess part of the difference is that, while communism witch hunts leverage our fear of \"the other\", child pornography gets at our primal urge to protect children, and amplifies it with the general stigma around sexuality and sexual perversion. It's this dangerously potent cocktail of elements that each individually suppress our rational ability to recognize the value of due process and the difference between accusation and proof.\n\nIt is the perfect tool for eliminating dissidents.

It's not exactly a half hour job, as he claims. iOS is not a small piece of software, and attempting to reverse engineer enough of the several million lines of assembly code in order to locate the code that's related to the login screen is probably several days worth of work.\n2. Suppose you are able to successfully modify the assembly code to by-pass the login screen. How do you replace the OS on the phone with your modified version? All of Apple's code is signed with a private key that is only known by Apple, and the phone has a secure boot system to prevent any unsigned code from being loaded. Without knowing the private key, you have to somehow circumvent the secure boot system, which is itself a massive undertaking.\n3. Suppose you somehow defeat the secure boot system and manage to load your modified version of the OS onto the phone and bypass the lock screen. Okay, what does that get you? **Absolutely nothing**. All of the data on the phone is still encrypted! At best, you might be able to run a few apps.\n\n> the actual storage of the pin could be found. \n\nThe PIN is not stored *anywhere* on the phone in *any* form. When a user chooses a PIN, it is combined with the unique hardware ID embedded into the chip during fabrication to produce an encryption key which is then used to encrypt the data on the phone. Once the data is encrypted, *that key is thrown away*! The only way to decrypt the phone is to *reproduce* the key, which can only be done by knowing both the PIN and the unique hardware ID.\n\nThinking that the PIN is stored on the phone is like thinking that people hang their key on the outside of their house next to their front door after they lock it.\n\n> The code isn't what allows him to decrypt, that has to deal with reversing what is essentially an algorithm using the machine ID and various other variables.\n\nThere are no secret algorithms to reverse. All cryptographic algorithms used by Apple are standard, well known, well documented algorithms that are used by *everyone*. There is no piece of code that you can \"reverse\" on the phone that will reveal the PIN or the key or will allow you to decrypt the phone without both of these things.\n\n---\n\nThe most *practical* theorized attack so far is to extract the encrypted data off of the phone, acquire the unique hardware ID from the chip by physically attacking it with acid and an electron microscope, then use an offline brute force attack on the PIN. The algorithms are well known and well documented, so if you have the encrypted data and the unique hardware ID then you don't need the phone any more. You can just write an algorithm which attempts to decrypt the data using the hardware ID and every possible one of the PINs until you find one that works. Because the PIN is only 4 to 6 digits in length, there are at most 1,000,000 possible values, which is few enough to easily brute-force in a relatively short period of time.

If you work IT, then you _have_ to use one to get anything done with your work's network.\n\nA blanket ban on VPNs will crush an IT sector, which is bad because it will prevent people from ever getting started in that field, which will eliminate growth in one of the few growing industries.\n\nThe reason it's going to prevent you from getting started: if you're trying to learn how to build a website (ie: internet-company startup) and the easiest way to setup a secure network is blocked, you'll be prevented from being able to build the website before building a vastly more expensive company network with certificates (and local LAN lines); incidentally, this also stops you from using the quicker ways to startup a site like AWS since you won't be setting up a secured network with cloud providers. \n\nOf course, a \"secure connection\" also means your traffic can't be easily monitored; this does not mean you're doing something illegal, regardless of the media messaging we hear about encryption.", "id": "d5udjfg"}, {"comment": "A VPN lets your device behave like it's in a different place, for networking purposes, through a secure connection to that place. This has several consequences:\n\n1. **Data security:** Because the connection is secure, if you send all your internet traffic through it, no one can snoop on what you're doing, or filter out some kinds of content, or hijack the internet to give you false content. At least not at the usual levels; for these purposes the VPN server would be somewhere close to the internet infrastructure and the usual mass surveillance could still apply if the connections from there on are insecure. But e.g. you could get this security all the way out of your dubious free wifi access point, or all the way out of your country. More and more of the internet is encrypted so VPNs aren't required to block snooping, but your service provider can still block or reroute encrypted data according to the destination, e.g. they might reduce your access to certain sites or even create fake versions to harvest your personal information.\n\n2. **Location spoofing**: You can find subscription services that host a VPN in just about any country you like, and to the rest of the internet you'll look like you're in that country instead of wherever you really are. So websites that distribute different content to different places, e.g. YouTube's videos with regional restrictions, will show you that country's content. (This doesn't work as well with Netflix because they simply refuse to serve the addresses of known VPN providers.)\n\n3. **Location concealment**: Another consequence of appearing to the internet that you're in your VPN server's location rather than your actual device's location is that no one can see where your device is. So your actions on the internet can't easily be traced to you. For example, this can be useful for illegally sharing pirated content without getting the standard warning letter from your ISP. Of course, in that situation you may get the warning letter from the VPN provider instead, if it's one that keeps the kind of records that could connect you to your activity on the VPN.\n\n4. **Local network access**: Organizations that have their own internal computer networks, which aren't open to the entire outside world because that would make them easier to hack, often use VPNs so people can connect from offsite. E.g. maybe you're traveling and need access to your company's data server, so you connect to their VPN, and now your device has similar access to when it's inside the office.\n\nCountries would make VPNs illegal mainly because of #1 and somewhat #3 as well. Dubai's government blocks internet content that it disapproves of, like pornography, and a VPN connection to a server outside Dubai will bypass their block. During turbulent times like large protests, some governments, such as those of Egypt, Turkey, and San Francisco, seek to reduce the flow of information by blocking access to the internet, particularly social-media sites like Facebook and Twitter. China's government goes further and tries to read the communications of its citizens, which it can't do if they're sent through secure connections to places outside China. Governments can also integrate their mass surveillance into the infrastructure of the internet, as the NSA does in the US, so the only way to bypass that interference is to route all your traffic through a secure connection to a country without mass surveillance - but this may still fail if your traffic has to go back through one of those countries in the end, e.g. to an American-hosted domain.", "id": "d5uezjk"}, {"comment": "These stupid analogies and long winded explanations people are giving make no sense\n\nStandard connection \n\nYou -> Server\n\nYou <- Server\n\nVPN connection\n\nYou -> VPN -> Server\n\nYou <- VPN <- Server\n\nIt's just putting a man (server) in the middle so the server doesn't know what your actual IP address is and your ISP doesn't know what server you're connecting too just the VPN's address.\n\nThey're making them illegal because they can't monitor your traffic without getting the VPN provider or your server providers logs of connections which most countries wouldn't give to the UAE", "id": "d5udt2w"}, {"comment": "A VPN is a virtual private network. For your average home user explanation - You subscribe to a paid service and by running an app on your smart phone or computer, all Internet traffic is routed through one of this company's servers in a country of your choice, before coming to your computer. This can affect the overall speed of your network, but the main effect is that it makes it seem as if all traffic is coming from a certain location, rather than your home country....\n\nSo if BBC iPlayer is only available in the UK, and you are in Japan, your computer would connect to their server in London, and the BBC website would assume that the connection was originating from within the UK. The app would then route that Data back to you in Japan, allowing you to bypass region locks et cetera.\n\nTo answer your final question, why would they do this: I don't know. I assume it's because the government/royal family is in cahoots with the big businesses over there who feel they are losing out on money from people using the services for free Internet calls, rather than paying them for the privilege via their cell phones et cetera.

Corperate wealth is soaring while tge everyman is fucked slowly.  There is clearly zero concern for workers on behalf of the companies around us. More jobs are exported to sweatshops in Asia leaving people here working for just over minimum wage at McDonald's or a stripmall somewhere selling these wares.

To say that some market was applied to them is more than a stretch IMHO.  The fact that the government takes such a massive role in R&D clearly undermines the notion of markets. Boeing is funded by the government and kept afloat by socializing the costs of research in clear defiance of market principles. There's just no other way around it that I see.

They are NEVER right.\n\nMaybe some people believe/do what this shitty writer wrote about. But phone calls are a much more efficient way of communicating messages and CLEARLY there is a HUGE difference between a blocked/unknown caller on your phone then a friend/work/family member.\n\nThis isn't the days of rotary phones where you didn't know who was calling, its clearly there on your screen. I frequently ignore unknown/blocked numbers, but will always answer a phone call from someone I know.\n\nThere is no reason not to. The other person is not more important then me and vice versa. If they are busy they will say so, if not then we will chat. \n\nThats what a phone is for. I think texting is one of the worst things to come to our generation. A former friend got upset that I finally stood up to her shoving her lifestyle on everyone with a joke comment I \"had the audacity\" to post on a facebook post of hers. She waited until 10:30pm to text instead of calling me with a long message. It looked like I was supposed to respond but I never did. I don't want to hear from that person or anyone after 10pm. Just because its a text doesn't make it right, its still intrusive and disrupting.\n\nJust think about how the average person texts and probably you even. I don't even get many texts and I will admit to doing this. Everytime you step away from your phone for a bit, do you not check your phone for new texts thinking you missed something? In line at the coffee shop or a store, do you pull out your phone to see if theirs a text? How many of you check it randomly at home when you see your phone? I know I do. First thing when I get up, right before I go to bed, when I leave the washroom, after the 10 minute car ride from home to work etc.\n\nIf you don't want ot admit you do the same things, just look around at other people constantly checking their phones to see what I mean.\n\nMillennials want instant gratification on everything, this does not exclude texts. When you text someone, you want to hear back within a few minutes, after that you start questioning things and getting frustrated. Again, whether or not YOU want to admit this happens to you, it definitely is something others do. \n\nI know that texting FEELS like its not as intrusive as a phone call. But I know that every time I text my dad for some question about my house, he may have to pause his show, go get his cell, or if he has it, he loses focus on the thing he is doing to answer my text. \n\nI know that when I text a question to him or others, I don't expect a fast response and am not looking for it. If I wanted a fast response  I would call. However after 5 minutes goes by, I wonder why I haven't gotten a response. I know this is dumb and I know I shouldn't, but it just happens due to the nature of technology.\n\nMillennials are not some friendly gods of the technology world, they are people, people who don't know how to communicate properly. They are not not calling people out of some righteous friendly courteous nature, it has 0 to do with that.

If you make a call to a 1-800 number, the call center gets your phone number anyways through ANI (every call transmits 2 caller phone numbers, ANI is used for billing and routing), which can't be blocked or hidden unless you control a phone company switchboard. Blocking CID doesn't block ANI.\n\nAlso, the majority of telemarketers these days that cold call will through automated means do sequential robo-dialing so even if you have an unlisted, private number, it's going to get called and the moment it rings, rather than \"This number is not in service\", it's added for future calling and it gets around that your number works.\n\nSo yeah, if you use CID blocking either to force people to pick up your call to know who you are or to avoid telemarketers, you're a problem that's damaging communications.

I am in the millennial bracket and i'm getting tired of these articles claiming they know the answer to anything. They are NEVER right.\n\nMaybe some people believe/do what this shitty writer wrote about. But phone calls are a much more efficient way of communicating messages and CLEARLY there is a HUGE difference between a blocked/unknown caller on your phone then a friend/work/family member.\n\nThis isn't the days of rotary phones where you didn't know who was calling, its clearly there on your screen. I frequently ignore unknown/blocked numbers, but will always answer a phone call from someone I know.\n\nThere is no reason not to. The other person is not more important then me and vice versa. If they are busy they will say so, if not then we will chat. \n\nThats what a phone is for. I think texting is one of the worst things to come to our generation. A former friend got upset that I finally stood up to her shoving her lifestyle on everyone with a joke comment I \"had the audacity\" to post on a facebook post of hers. She waited until 10:30pm to text instead of calling me with a long message. It looked like I was supposed to respond but I never did. I don't want to hear from that person or anyone after 10pm. Just because its a text doesn't make it right, its still intrusive and disrupting.\n\nJust think about how the average person texts and probably you even. I don't even get many texts and I will admit to doing this. Everytime you step away from your phone for a bit, do you not check your phone for new texts thinking you missed something? In line at the coffee shop or a store, do you pull out your phone to see if theirs a text? How many of you check it randomly at home when you see your phone? I know I do. First thing when I get up, right before I go to bed, when I leave the washroom, after the 10 minute car ride from home to work etc.\n\nIf you don't want ot admit you do the same things, just look around at other people constantly checking their phones to see what I mean.\n\nMillennials want instant gratification on everything, this does not exclude texts. When you text someone, you want to hear back within a few minutes, after that you start questioning things and getting frustrated. Again, whether or not YOU want to admit this happens to you, it definitely is something others do. \n\nI know that texting FEELS like its not as intrusive as a phone call. But I know that every time I text my dad for some question about my house, he may have to pause his show, go get his cell, or if he has it, he loses focus on the thing he is doing to answer my text. \n\nI know that when I text a question to him or others, I don't expect a fast response and am not looking for it. If I wanted a fast response  I would call. However after 5 minutes goes by, I wonder why I haven't gotten a response. I know this is dumb and I know I shouldn't, but it just happens due to the nature of technology.\n\nMillennials are not some friendly gods of the technology world, they are people, people who don't know how to communicate properly. They are not not calling people out of some righteous friendly courteous nature, it has 0 to do with that.

A really good show.\n\nBut it's nothing like DC politics. If you want to see a more accurate portrayal of behind-the-scenes American politics, watch Veep.\n\nEdit: Let me expand a bit. \n\nHoC gets some things right -- particularly the horse trading that's involved with politics. But even in these smoke filled backrooms where power brokers wheel and deal, it's not nearly as sinister or dark as the show portrays. Legislators absolutely do make deals to advance their career or send money back to their district... but not quite to the Machiavellian levels of Frank Underwood and company. \n\nVeep, on the other hand, very accurately portrays how banal and plain silly DC politics can be. Congressmen and their political staffers spend a lot of time dealing with messaging, optics, and overbearing special interests. Decisions like what tie to wear or how you're going to get on the Sunday talk shows are much more commonplace than how you're going to silence a journalist or usurp a colleague's power.\n\nBeing a member of Congress, for the most part, is a fairly cush job. And the opportunities AFTER serving are unbelievable. Most members are really just trying to figure out how to win their next election. How to recover from that stupid thing they said that hit the Times. Being pissed at Congressman X because they are against a bill that's going to send dollars back to your district or because they made you look dumb in committee. \n\nMostly, though, I think HoC (much like West Wing) gets the dialogue wrong. Don't get me wrong, there are intelligent and eloquent people roaming the halls of congress. Most of them are lawyers. But not everyone is a master orator that speaks like Aaron Sorkin is feeding them lines in their head. They're just people. People are awkward and goofy.

Without being able to see more....I'm pretty sure this is a scam, or at the very least he's being very dishonest. The car he was using was an Acura ILX. The ILX has adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist ([here's a video of the tech in another Acura car, the TLX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxFAxU-tj4Q)). The combination of the two will keep you within a lane on a highway, including around most curves, and it will control your speed, even bringing you to a complete stop in traffic, without any input needed. The one set of camera's the video showed (in front of the rearview mirror) is from that system. I saw nothing demonstrated in that video which isn't possible on a stock ILX. In fact, the two buttons he told the journalist control his system actually control the ACC/LCAS systems on a normal car. He may be building upon those systems, but from what he's demonstrated there's no meaningful improvements that have actually been put into place.\n\nWhat would be a meaningful improvement?\n\n* changing lanes on its own (Tesla can do this, right now Acura's tech does not)\n\n* making a turn to go down another street\n\n* parking itself (other car manufacturers can do this, Acura does not)\n\n* taking itself on or off the highway by using an exit ramp\n\nAll he showed was the car staying within the lane on a relatively straight highway. Any 2016 ILX (with the tech package) can do this. This makes me really suspicious. He appears to be capturing the outputs of those systems (and he disabled the alarm that sounds if you keep your hands off the wheel for too long, but that's not hard to do if you're hooked into the car's computer) but as far as I can tell he's not actually having the car do anything new.

In November of 2014, I moved from my current house (about 15 minutes from work) to a new house (about 35-40 minutes away, but still easily doable at the time). The DAY AFTER I MOVED, my car broke down for good (forget what mechanic said, but a lot to fix) so I scrapped that car and started looking for a new car. In the meantime, I slept on my mom's floor five days a week while I looked for a new car.\n\nCome March, I had a few thousand saved up and the job that I had had a LOT of shady stuff start happening so I decided to jump ship before I got fired (after two years of not one problem, three major issues in one week and they were looking to fire me, they still have problems with the same supervisor now that gave me trouble but refuse to fire her?) and get a new job closer to home and whatnot while getting a car.\n\nWell, I never ended up being able to find another job and so the money I had saved for a car went to being able to live (buying food and shit). I got another job temporarily, but they were working me one day a week for like five hours so I ended up quitting there. \n\nI struggled along making ends meet until my lease ran out in November of 15, and I moved in with my girlfriend. I got a job at Target, was using her vehicle for work and all was fine. A month later, some really shady stuff happened and I got kicked out of the house at 2 AM one morning. No money, I had to quit my job (no car), now I had no house and no job. Since then, I've been couch surfing and making money where I can. I had started working a construction job about two weeks ago but a week in, my boss started being really shady (hey, be here at x time and five hours later he's no show calling me saying sorry, be there tomorrow), well that's lasted until today so as of right now I'm sitting at my current girlfriends house using her internet while she's at work for another half an hour. I'm doing my best to get out of my situation, but I'm stuck in a no place to stay so I'm not close to anything because sleeping next to or inside anything in town is very fucking illegal and I have no car so no transportation to a job. My area is very spread out anyways, so having a car only makes the problem easy, not solved. \n\nEDIT; before you ask about help from other family, I don't have any. My father who I don't have a relationship with is dying as the days go (probably a few months left to live, he's already lived longer than doctors said he would), and the rest of my family is super religious oriented and being non religious in the bible belt means I got shafted. My family owns my town and my brother has a reputation as a drug using stealing piece of shit, so there's a natural bias problem when people know who I am unfortunately. That, coupled with the fact that I have undiagnosed seizures (14k in medical bills and all they can tell me is acute grand mal seizures) makes it REALLY HARD to find a job and get stable.\n\nEDIT 2; added age, so people won't think I'm 40 and doing this currently.

This might be the case in state run news, but then you've gotta worry about propaganda. Media outlets are businesses and they are run like businesses. Their purpose is to make money for a very small group of people who own/operate it. And since they are in control they will always spin the news in favour of their political alignment.

They aren't actually corrupt because we have freedom of the press, it's their right to report the news the way they see fit.
