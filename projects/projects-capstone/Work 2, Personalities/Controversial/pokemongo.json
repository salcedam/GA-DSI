I admittedly was upset about the taking away of the tracker, but I just used 3rd party apps to be able to track when out here in the rural and suburban areas.  My best hauls are going into the city at a popular spot and just taking advantage of the frequent spawns and good catches though.   With that being said, once the 3rd party support was killed, I just stopped playing as often.  Same thing with the stepson, which sort of sucked, because we had a lot of fun going out finding the ones we didn't yet have.   I know that there are current ones (trackers), but I don't care for going through with the cat and mouse game with Niantic.   Even if I did and got banned, I don't think I would trip on it though.  That's just the risk that people take when they exploit a game.  But my post was sort of a play on the recent IV info bans and some creative techniques using geometry that people have came up with to track Pokemon. \n\nI've bitched at Niantic in recent posts, but in reality, it's screaming for them to come to a middle ground on what the users want, and better communication.   There are a lot of things that I would love to see them do, and I'll post those ideas as well, and then move on.  Just to get them off my chest.  \n\nEspecially that hideous looking hardware wrist tracker.   I would love to see them utilize some resources to build a paid tracker app for both Android and Apple watches.  Good all around.  Hardware smart watch manufacturers see more sales, Niantic sees more money (possibly even some via kickbacks from hardware manufactures if they play their cards right) , and users get back what they've most screamed about in an even more useful form.

They too are \"playing the game and enjoying themselves\" at really no expense to other players. Sometimes they take gyms, sure, but does that really even matter?

I am perturbed that there are people advocating for a reduction in game efficiency or who actively denounce the idea of updates that would improve the game immensely on the basis that cheaters could exploit these to break the game. So? There will always be cheaters. Getting stressed about it and punishing the whole community for that doesn't alter that fact. The problem with ethics and moral absolutes are that they blind people to other perspectives and essentially turn people into pompous and mindless zealots. \n\nMy advice to you would be to realize that the high road is a metaphorical invention, and there's no such path that allows you to look down on others with impunity.

They too are \"playing the game and enjoying themselves\" at really no expense to other players. Sometimes they take gyms, sure, but does that really even matter? It's ridiculously difficult to take a gym and hold it for more than a day in most populated areas. The problem is that \"good\" or \"bad\" are always subjective and on a gradient. \n\nI personally distrust anyone who believes in moral absolutes - even concepts like theft and murder can be arbitrary, which is why in the US we have a court system to weigh all of the variables and adjudicate accordingly.\n\nI don't really care about spoofers or hackers. I am perturbed that there are people advocating for a reduction in game efficiency or who actively denounce the idea of updates that would improve the game immensely on the basis that cheaters could exploit these to break the game. So? There will always be cheaters. Getting stressed about it and punishing the whole community for that doesn't alter that fact. The problem with ethics and moral absolutes are that they blind people to other perspectives and essentially turn people into pompous and mindless zealots. \n\nMy advice to you would be to realize that the high road is a metaphorical invention, and there's no such path that allows you to look down on others with impunity. Especially people who use PokeVision, PokeScanner, etc. because there are valid and logical excuses for why these players are using these tools to play the game.

This is a side effect of anonymity or pseudo-anonymity.\n\nNegative opinions are fine.  Welcomed even.  Criticism and critiques are natural and help a game grow.  When a negative opinion is being said for the pure purpose of being a negative opinion and harming the target of the comment, that is where the problem is.  And that is where the subreddit has gone.  From criticism to bullying and harassment.\n\nNow, let me explain something else to you.

Hell, even if they had a very active PR person directly talking to the community the entire time it would still be beyond moronic to say Brazil people talking made the developers unable to make developments.\n\nI'm not saying that Brazil was the only reason.  It was a tongue in cheek comment.  And I have no defense for the lack of communication from Niantic.  They could have headed a lot of negativity off by being more open with us.\n\n>Yes, they have made that very clear with their recent \"bugs\".\n\nIf they left the 'bugs' unacknowledged, then I would agree with you.  A company that admits something is broken, generally isn't trying to hide a money grab.  But I could be wrong and I will reserve judgement when more facts are uncovered.\n\n>Sometimes I wonder. not purposefully maybe.\n\nNo argument there.  The lack of communication for a game with millions of players is appalling and I'm glad they are actually addressing that now.\n\n>Seems like the kinda stuff that should have been found in beta testing. You know, before a world wide launch.\n\nNiantic woefully underestimated what was needed.  They anticipated a peak of 10 million players, world wide after 1 year.  They got that in the first hour of launch.  Servers and code tend to break when you shove 10 to 100 times the anticipated requests through their pipes.\n\n>Normally I would agree with you about 3rd party apps (except with wow etc..), but in this case they removed one of the very few core features of the game. Not allowing a 3rd party app that acts as a substitute (even temporarily) for said broken feature is not something I agree with.\n\nThis is something that we need to give Niantic the benefit of the doubt on.  The existence of a third party site that uses bots, spoofing, or API data from Niantic's servers is something not many companies are going allow for long.  We are asking for a crack down on spoofing and bots but those are integral to tracking apps.  The amount of strain the 3rd party apps put on Niantic's servers, while they are trying to finish a global launch, may have been manageable but I cannot fault Niantic from erring on the side of caution.  They could have handled all of this a lot better and it would be nice to see Niantic working with the tracker sites instead of a blanket shut down.\n\n>You seem like the kind of person that would say \"Niantic doesn't owe you anything\", well... as it turns out none of the consumers owe them anything either.\n\nThis is very true.  And if you want Niantic to get the message you are not satisfied there are methods and means available that are not analogues to harassment.  Withholding from purchases not demanding refunds.  Constructive criticism not insults and slander.\n\n>If something is bad I'm not going to cover for a game company. Especially one that has been so silent, gotten \"bugs\" that seem to be a cash grab, and removed a borderline essential core feature (as well as a 3rd party substitute).\n\nAgain, the point is that the facts need to be presented but not overly negatively.  There is a difference in pointing out a flaw and shoving their face into it until the bubbles stop.\n\n>Just because something is negative doesn't mean that it isn't helpful/informative.\n\nAgain, I agree.  Negative criticism and comments are helpful and informative.  We can be civilized about it if we so choose.\n\n>I'm definitely not a child. Having a negative opinion about something doesn't mean I am throwing a tantrum. Frankly it's pretty childish to make that analogy.\n\nYou are not throwing a tantrum.

Hold the presses!  What makes an actual company?  Could it be that Niantic has an incorporation?  Which makes it an actual company?  Heavens to murgatroyd, it couldn't be true!  They couldn't have given Pokemon to an actual company....one that makes games for that matter...\n\nHerein lies the crux of your complaints.  A triple A game company did not pick up Pokemon and produce it.  Why?  Because they couldn't be bothered, didn't want to be bothered, and didn't see any profit.  Niantic's own forecast put the demand at 10 million players by next year.  As in a slow build to 10 million.  And they didn't come up with that number in a bubble.  Any other game company would have made the same assumption.  Which means the projected profits from the game were too low for a big name like EA, Ubisoft, Konami, Bioware, Valve, or whatever company you have a hard on for.\n\nWhich means that the projected profits were perfect for smaller companies.  And what is the only company in the world with actual experience building and maintaining a geolocation game?  Niantic.  Founded by someone who had a big hand in Google Maps, the program you use to go visit Auntie May.\n\nSo no.  No other company could have done what Niantic did in this time frame.  If you did hand it off to a larger publisher, it would have been dropped after a year of development as they struggled to work out the kinks of putting in millions of geo-caches.\n\nHand it to a smaller indie company and it would take 3-4 years from now to be where we are today.\n\nSo, take a deep breath and actually think about why Pokemon trusted their IP to Niantic.  You know, the ones that care more about the game than you.  The ones who own the goddamn copyright to Pokemon.  Your opinions of what company should have been trusted, where Niantic should be at development wise, where they should focus their attention mean diddly squat.  People with experience in programming, software development, and server infrastructure, the folks who actually do this shit for a living know that Niantic is doing the best that can be done.

And having a small team and limited time is no excuse to publish a game with very limited content. Especially because it is a pokemon game. A game in a very popular franchise. One of which people expect a certain quality. Of course I am grateful for this game. But it had so much more potential. And the content that's there not functioning fully is quite frustrating.

However core components have not been removed.  What is the core of the game?  Catching pokemon and filling the pokedex.  The tracker, maps, gym battles, and eggs are all gravy on top.  The tracker was not working to their standards and instead of leaving the three steps visible or straining the servers, they pulled it so they could retool it without the player base being confused or thinking the game is broken.  The communication on what has happened was not the greatest and I will not defend that.  Niantic could have gotten ahead of a lot of the frustration with some well timed comments but they were late and it has spun into a constant hate of Niantic.\n\nAgain, this is an early access game.

If 100% of the developer effort results in the final roll out happening in three months less time, do you really want to delay the rest of the world from playing?  Niantic would be accused of favoritism and there would be threads on this subreddit demanding the game, bugs and all.\n\nFeature development can be a big effort.  This is not some indie app that one guy coded in his basement.  As soon as you add multiple authors to the same source code, development time goes up as it takes a bit of effort to integrate everything.\n\nPlease show me where Niantic was careless with the bots and spoofers.  By ignoring the spoofers, for the moment, Niantic focused on server stability, which they successfully have maintained throughout several region expansions.  Twitch has posted a notice that spoofers and bots are not able to use Twitch as a broadcasting platform.  This will help put pressure on spoofers and then Niantic, freed up from the very demanding task of expansion, can do massive ban waves and kill off the spoofing population.\n\nThird party apps do not create a different route to enjoy the game.  They needlessly clog the server with requests and tie up effort to ensure the servers can handle the load when those man hours could be used on the features you want so badly.  In other words, do you want tracking apps from the third party or do you want a tracking app in the game that works?  You can't have both.\n\nNiantic has communicated that they are working on fixing the broken tracking system several times already.  You say 'no consideration' but that is blatantly a lie.  Keeping the footprints when they never change will confuse new players and old players would just ignore it anyways.  Removing the defunct footprints cleans up the app.  The flip side that everyone is ignoring is that Niantic is working on a replace for the tracking.  No consideration would be Niantic saying that tracking pokemon isn't important and they aren't going to replace it.  Which they haven't said.  Because they aren't the villain here like everyone wants to believe.\n\nNiantic are pokemon fans.

Unlike the regular games, where you progress through different areas, Go has us in the same areas for the most part, so we will be seeing the same Pokemon a lot.\n\nWith training you can catch one pidgey with the 'best' move set, evolve it, and then you never catch another pidgey. From there on you avoid them, essentially removing a component of the game. Once you've done that for many/all nearby Pokemon, you have no more need to hunt around for new ones. The game becomes just walking between gyms.\n\nWithout training, you are constantly catching more pidgey, comparing your old one with great moves to your new higher cp one with worse moves. You are constantly progressing, changing your team, changing your battle tactics.\n\nThe training system worked well for a single player rpg, but it wouldn't fit as well as a multiplayer ar game.

I dont personally think that the trailer was made during a time where the had core mechanics set in stone. So by the time it was done and aired it could be that things had drastically changed....\n\nCP training is still a very narrow minded way to approach things...still is involving too much sentimental value as a \"reason\" and not taking into consideration game balancing health or player enjoyment. \n\nTo expand on what Sid said:\n\nHeres the main reason why linear training cant work in a game that involves other people. People that start this game first will level their pokes. Taking gyms with ease and putting their level 100s (example) in there. Along comes a new player down the road....what is this player to do with the current situation (i.e. CP training restricted to gyms and safari style wild encounters). This new player's level 5 tododile *doesn't stand a chance*....for training at friendlies or taking enemy team. Good bye to a huge portion of the game for this new player.\n\nWith CP scaling with trainer level....new players have a chance to catch up quicker, not rely solely on gyms and they dont have to waste resources training one poke and hope it holds up. \n\nThink of MMOs. Each area is mainly designated to a level range. The game at the same time depends on multi player interaction to make it interesting.  The game gives incentives for being in the area of your level range (sometimes they use dimishing returns as a deterrant too). What happens when the higher levels come to the lower level areas to either PK or hog resources...? *The game becomes boring and annoying for new players*. What the hell does this have to do with PGO you mighy ask?  You can loosely classify PGO as a MMO...what the developers cant do in AR is do level restriction areas like you can online....So what happens to the game health? It goes right down the drain. \n\nIt helps to look at this game from the developers view instead always thinking of that the player wants.

Small teams are always the best and the worst excuse when it comes to game development. This time around, I think it's the latter. Small teams usually happen because of lack of funds but the entire world is watching Pokemon GO. They could easily upgrade their team. Let me remind you that many great games are made by small teams. No man's sky is done by 10 men. People are still waiting patiently. Stardew valley and Minecraft was done by 1 man each. The Witcher series were done by tiny squads as well.\n\nMost fans would rather wait than see their favourite series get ruined. At it's current state, it seems like pokemon is going to eventually follow the dreaded f2p models out there. Not yet, but going to.\n\nBe realistic, most people are not gonna stick to the game, give feedback, and report issues. Most people would just leave and do something better instead.

And that is still way less effort then if I had popped up on a tracker and I had to run for it.\n\nAlso I am SUPER CONFUSED how people think trackers = army of rares. Like 90% of trackers I've seen will give you the same range as sightings, maybe a little further. If you are one of those people who swear that sightings is an accurate tracker, you should have an equal chance of catching the dragonite as the tracker user, it will just probably take you longer to get there. Like the day before trackers went down I had a snorlax on my sightings list, pulled up a tracker site, and determined that it was impossible for me to reach before it despawned, so despite using a tracker I still don't have a snorlax because shockingly it doesn't actually hand you the pokemon! Even if I HAD gotten there in time there was a good chance that it would have fled or something. That was quite possibly the only chance at a snorlax I'll ever have, I do not expect to ever finish my pokedex personally because even if I DID use trackers it doesn't mean shit if nothing spawns. \n\nI think people just don't want to ever admit they have unfair advantages. A huge amount of comments I see complaining about \"dragonites being handed to you\" include humble bragging about how they have LEGIT dragonites they got WITHOUT trackers when a decent chunk probably have them because of sheer luck like everything I have half decent right now. I fully admit I have an advantage over people with no gyms or stops nearby, and the fact that some rarer shit sometimes spawns near my house.

And there is no community in asking a server to map a pokemons location for you so you can justify playing the game.

As long as you don't drive dangerously (i.e. drive 10 km/h anywhere that has a speed limit over 15 km/h, stopping everywhere randomly and turning in the street) I think this is not only okay, but also not cheating. As long as you're not driving yourself of course. There is no rule in the ToS or Trainer Guidelines that says you cannot play while in a moving vehicle. You are just cheating yourself from some exercise, that's all. \n\n> People don't think sitting on lured stops all day is cheating.\n\nWell, this is a specific mechanic of the game, so no, I don't think it's cheating either. Again, you are cheating yourself from some exercise, there is no rule that states you cannot do this. And why would they, it makes them money. Of course it's an unfair advantage to have multiple stops near eachother, because most places don't have that. \n\n> People don't think pressing a single button to have some device play the game for you is cheating.\n\nOf course that's cheating, it's botting. That specifically mentioned under cheating in the Trainer Guidelines!\n\n> People don't think buying incubators with cash gives you an unfair advantage.\n\nIt does I suppose, but like with many games, you can either invest money or spend more time playing to get more stuff. So people who just play after work in the evening can still keep up. The difference is that you cannot just buy good pokemon in this game. And you will still not when there's trading as the ToS states you cannot trade the stuff you can buy with money. I suppose the only thing this might affect is stardust you get from egg hatching. That *might* be tradable, we don't know yet. Anyways, buying incubators definitely gives an advantage but IMO, not an unfair advantage. If you cannot spend money on the game, you might be able to spend more time. If you cannot spend more time either, be happy someone else is paying so that you can keep playing this game for free :)! \n\n> People don't think teaming up with 20 people to keep an iron grip on all gyms in your area gives you an unfair advantage.\n\nAgain, that's not unfair. It sucks if people keep doing that, that's not giving other players a fair chance. But it's also tactics. This is much stronger in Ingress apparently. Perhaps that game would actually be more suited for people who really like teaming up to keep portals/gyms under iron grip, than pokemon go!\n\n> People don't think living somewhere where the spawn is 10x as good as in other places gives you an unfair advantage.\n\nI suppose that actually is unfair, just because I really have no idea why the heck they didn't change it in between beta and release. Cell data makes sense for Ingress but it's quite the opposite for pokemon... And it's often not as simple as just going to a bigger city, as that might be far or might be expensive. I suppose it's a bit fair in the sense that everyone who really wants *can* go to a more busy place, just like going to a place with many pokestops together for lures, but it's unfair from Niantic - not the players themselves - that pokemon spawns are not distributed equally. \n\n> But god forbid if people use a map to catch something other than Pidgeys. Now, THAT'S cheating and giving you an unfair advantage.\n\nIt is, it's using a third party service/website and that's against ToS. Stupid as it might sound. \n\n\nBut yeah, overall, I agree people are a bit hypocrit about this stuff. Like, 'It's not cheating if I use 2 devices to mass evolve so that I can make twice as much XP from my lucky egg!' Or: 'It's not cheating to use 2 accounts on different teams and use one to push the bottom pokemon out so that I only have to train it once to get mine in!' - the last one especially for lvl 10 gyms. And then they do consider maps cheating."], [1, "What was your point supposed to be about being at lures all day being cheating? I don't think anyone argued that paying for incubators and hatching more eggs was not an advantage. Or teaming up with fellow team mates? Of course that gives you an advantage, who is arguing that it doesn't give an advantage? That's why people are willing to meet up with local players they've never met. And if you don't want to put in the time/effort to do those things that's completely fine but you'll be at a disadvantage of a group of players - I don't think anyone has argued against that.\nI see daily posts about rural players and how it's difficult to play the game, and posts about Santa Monica and Coronado - What people are saying that there's no advantage to the location of where you're living?\n\nI think comparing people driving and people using 3rd party scanners if fair because they're both against ToS and they both give an advantage to the player doing that. \nPeople have a problem with it for what ever reason, they don't want to do something that is against ToS, they think it's cheating and they don't like to do something that would be considered unfair to other players so they can complain about that. But people can still drive and play. When trackers are back when they get around whats stopping it by RE then a lot of players will be using the scanners again. \n\nThe people that are so against trackers don't understand that people either aren't that dedicated to playing a cell phone game nor have the time. So those players don't even bother playing which is understandable.\n\nI just don't understand your points about lures = cheating. Anything bought with money SHOULD give you an advantage, so lures, incubators, lucky eggs, Pokemon Go Plus BETTER give an advantage if I spend money. If it didn't then wth would be the point? No one should argue against that bc in a Free2Play game, you can play free all you want, if you spend money you should expect to gain an advantage over those playing for free. \nNot sure all the people complaining about cheating/unfair advantages. But I continue to drive and play, and I always took advantage of the scanners. \nSo I hope they come back, or Niantic fixes their tracking b/c the huge drop in players is depressing when you think of the populars places being dead compared to when there's 100+ ppl playing a pokemon game.

Thats how the game was designed. You can't have a completely free game with literally no advertisements and micro-transactions. How would the app ever make money? The app literally couldn't exist without it being some form of pay to win.\n\nThe other points are just literally strategy. Are you against using strategy to win games? Playing with friends is cheating because why?? Are you not allowed to do the same?\n\nNow I can see how you might think 3rd party tracker software is \"strategy,\" but that is where you would be wrong.

The only difference is, how it is created.\n\nEveryone would be fine, if we use a map in which people report spawns, nests, etc. (like a social map)\nIt is still a map that helps you in finding pokemon. To some point it is the same as pulling the data from the API, but in a more passive way. The bad thing about crowd populated maps is: Trolls, wrong reports and you need a big number of active players in an area.\n\nUsing the API cuts of all of this. No wrong reports, no trolls and you don't need a certain count of active players to map the whole area 24/7.\n\nThe question is, is there any difference for the end user, if the map is crowd populated or by automated processes?

Opening a scanner takes time, in that time I walk one direction and find the second point for my triangulating. The only problem I have at the moment, that the area I can \"see\" is to small... 200 meters radius is fine for triangulating, but not for finding rare pokemon that you need to complete your pokedex... without a higher range to \"see\" it is close to impossible to find this last missing pieces if there is no known area for them and they randomly spawn somewhere.

The reason the trackers are banned aren't because \"they are unfair\", it's because of them using the API and the bigger ones using a bot army to scan, which obviously can have negative effects on the actual game. It's not the \"finding pokemon\" part that makes it questionable.\n\nMy best pokemon is a 100% IV gyarados I caught with minimal effort sitting at a lure someone else put up in a park. My second best pokemon is a high IV vaporeon, which is high IV because I caught it before the dex IV scaling glitch. My third strongest pokemon is a lapras I hatched with enough candy to power it up to 1900cp.\n\nLike people keep saying trackers just \"hand you\" the pokemon but how the fuck were my best -legit- pokemon NOT just handed to me on a silver platter. The only one that took any effort was the gyarados because I had to catch it and power it up with candies I earned catching magikarp. And that is still way less effort then if I had popped up on a tracker and I had to run for it.\n\nAlso I am SUPER CONFUSED how people think trackers = army of rares. Like 90% of trackers I've seen will give you the same range as sightings, maybe a little further. If you are one of those people who swear that sightings is an accurate tracker, you should have an equal chance of catching the dragonite as the tracker user, it will just probably take you longer to get there. Like the day before trackers went down I had a snorlax on my sightings list, pulled up a tracker site, and determined that it was impossible for me to reach before it despawned, so despite using a tracker I still don't have a snorlax because shockingly it doesn't actually hand you the pokemon! Even if I HAD gotten there in time there was a good chance that it would have fled or something. That was quite possibly the only chance at a snorlax I'll ever have, I do not expect to ever finish my pokedex personally because even if I DID use trackers it doesn't mean shit if nothing spawns. \n\nI think people just don't want to ever admit they have unfair advantages. A huge amount of comments I see complaining about \"dragonites being handed to you\" include humble bragging about how they have LEGIT dragonites they got WITHOUT trackers when a decent chunk probably have them because of sheer luck like everything I have half decent right now. I fully admit I have an advantage over people with no gyms or stops nearby, and the fact that some rarer shit sometimes spawns near my house.

As long as you don't drive dangerously (i.e. drive 10 km/h anywhere that has a speed limit over 15 km/h, stopping everywhere randomly and turning in the street) I think this is not only okay, but also not cheating. As long as you're not driving yourself of course. There is no rule in the ToS or Trainer Guidelines that says you cannot play while in a moving vehicle. You are just cheating yourself from some exercise, that's all. \n\n> People don't think sitting on lured stops all day is cheating.\n\nWell, this is a specific mechanic of the game, so no, I don't think it's cheating either. Again, you are cheating yourself from some exercise, there is no rule that states you cannot do this. And why would they, it makes them money. Of course it's an unfair advantage to have multiple stops near eachother, because most places don't have that. \n\n> People don't think pressing a single button to have some device play the game for you is cheating.\n\nOf course that's cheating, it's botting. That specifically mentioned under cheating in the Trainer Guidelines!\n\n> People don't think buying incubators with cash gives you an unfair advantage.\n\nIt does I suppose, but like with many games, you can either invest money or spend more time playing to get more stuff. So people who just play after work in the evening can still keep up. The difference is that you cannot just buy good pokemon in this game. And you will still not when there's trading as the ToS states you cannot trade the stuff you can buy with money. I suppose the only thing this might affect is stardust you get from egg hatching. That *might* be tradable, we don't know yet. Anyways, buying incubators definitely gives an advantage but IMO, not an unfair advantage. If you cannot spend money on the game, you might be able to spend more time. If you cannot spend more time either, be happy someone else is paying so that you can keep playing this game for free :)! \n\n> People don't think teaming up with 20 people to keep an iron grip on all gyms in your area gives you an unfair advantage.\n\nAgain, that's not unfair. It sucks if people keep doing that, that's not giving other players a fair chance. But it's also tactics. This is much stronger in Ingress apparently. Perhaps that game would actually be more suited for people who really like teaming up to keep portals/gyms under iron grip, than pokemon go!\n\n> People don't think living somewhere where the spawn is 10x as good as in other places gives you an unfair advantage.\n\nI suppose that actually is unfair, just because I really have no idea why the heck they didn't change it in between beta and release. Cell data makes sense for Ingress but it's quite the opposite for pokemon... And it's often not as simple as just going to a bigger city, as that might be far or might be expensive. I suppose it's a bit fair in the sense that everyone who really wants *can* go to a more busy place, just like going to a place with many pokestops together for lures, but it's unfair from Niantic - not the players themselves - that pokemon spawns are not distributed equally. \n\n> But god forbid if people use a map to catch something other than Pidgeys. Now, THAT'S cheating and giving you an unfair advantage.\n\nIt is, it's using a third party service/website and that's against ToS. Stupid as it might sound. \n\n\nBut yeah, overall, I agree people are a bit hypocrit about this stuff. Like, 'It's not cheating if I use 2 devices to mass evolve so that I can make twice as much XP from my lucky egg!'

I've not bothered attacking 2 of them since the update."], [4, "Sorry, for some reason i do not feel sleepy tonight, i might go a bit overboard with reactions here :))\n\nFirst of all; i wanted to comment on this section:\n\n''Leveling up a gym individually is still easier and faster than taking one down because you are only leveling it up to put 1 mon in, whereas when attacking you re fighting 10(for a level 10 gym) people who INDIVIDUALLY took a couple of mins to stick their mon in. Collectively it does seem like one person can undo the work of 10 people, but from individual perspective, no one looks at it that way, its only \"how much time did I spent to take down a gym vs how long I took to level it up for the same amount of reward(10 coins)\"\n\nI will be honest; i laughed at this statement. This is factually incorrect, theoretically incorrect; and etc etc. :)) It is only faster to level up a gym from zero to lvl3; which does not require any training :D\n\nExample 1:\nI can take down lvl3 gyms (no matter what pokemon inside - 2800 snorlax etc.) in 3-4 minutes. On the other hand; 'to put my pokemon in a lvl 3 friendly gym (3 pokemon assumed); I need to train it 2 times (Fighting with 50% CP pokemon); which takes considerably longer and uses more resources. Also, this is highly unlikely as friendly gym poke has varied CP and it is mostly impossible to train all 3 pokemon at the same time; meaning i need to just attack 1st pokemon 4 times (selecting 6 pokemon to attack 4 times!!).\n\nExample 2:\nTaking down a lvl7 gym - attack 1 turn; 7k lost. gym is lvl 5 - assume maximum time spent on all defenders (90 secs) = 10.5 minutes\n\nImagine this training 1 pokemon (500 prestige gained) to lvl a gym up from lvl7 to lvl8 (20,000 prestige to 30,000 prestige).\n\nYou do the math. Or maybe, don't do it... :D\n\nYour statement; however; is correct for the previous version of the gyms - where you saw all these stagnant lvl 10 gyms? -> people actually spent time to train those. So if you expected to take down a lvl 10 gym; you needed to spend at least 30-45 minutes to do so; similar to what these people had spent doing it.\n\nAlso, keeping 10 gyms all the time is not selfish; it means more effort and better pokemon (excluding all the cheaters). You don't beat (or expect to beat) the Elite4 in games with magikarp, do you? If your pokemon is not strong enough, or you do not have time to take down a gym; you do not do it. Simple game. The game had an ingame mechanic to balance this in the long run; pokemon receives 50% less CP per power up, after lvl30. So, this means that when you hit lvl 30, your pokemon becomes similar CP level with any of the higher level players and can compete fairly.\n\nCurrent gym system completely destroys any point in getting any strong pokemon/powering up pokemon. Only point of the current game is completing pokedex, which is lame imo.\n\nIn the end, it is just a game; no need to be upset about it. However, when i see such factually wrong comments; i want to comment on it :D\n\nBtw; you should be a bit less aggressive with the rant. There are married/in relationship people here; you might be the person jerking off, crying about not getting into gyms before :))\n"], [3, "> Training takes some effort now AS IT SHOULD\n\nOkay, let's be fair here. You have to stand there tapping your screen for a lot longer than before. That's not effort. Nothing about this game is effort worthy of a reaction like this. It's mostly about having the luck of being in an area that has a lot of stuff around, or being willing to pay for it.\n\nAt its core, the entire game is built around two things: (1) getting people to give up their money under the guise of (2) getting people to meet each other (under the guise of playing Pokemon).\n\nThe system they have in place is clearly built under some fantasy premise where *effort* isn't what's at play, but *lots of people* are at play. We aren't supposed to be going it solo to the extent most of us are. The problems we're dealing with are because people aren't playing the way they want anymore, and they don't like that. They won't change the game for it either.\n\nThat said...\n\n> 100 free coins a day\n\nThe fact this exists is... kind of a real wake up call. I don't really begrudge you guys who do it, because I get you must have spent a lot of time to get to that point in the first place, but that realization makes me just want to delete the app, unsubscribe, and go back to Alpha Sapphire to wipe myself clean of this before Sun and Moon come out tomorrow. \n\nI'm proud of the 80 I've barely managed since I started playing and you guys were getting 100 *a day*? I'd be thrilled with *10* a day. Hell, if I could have *1* a day, I'd have more than I do now. Though this is something I've been saying for a while, which is that Niantic can't have the pay-to-win currency only be available to the \"winners.\" Give it *more* to the winners, but freemium games work because they keep free players in with handouts.

I agree, it should be hard to bring up a gym to level 10, and bubble strat should be killed because its dumb, but it should also be hard to take down a level 10 gym. 10 people painstakingly build up a gym and it gets taken down in 20 minutes by one person and you're going to call that fair???

This is factually incorrect, theoretically incorrect; and etc etc. :)) It is only faster to level up a gym from zero to lvl3; which does not require any training :D\n\nExample 1:\nI can take down lvl3 gyms (no matter what pokemon inside - 2800 snorlax etc.) in 3-4 minutes. On the other hand; 'to put my pokemon in a lvl 3 friendly gym (3 pokemon assumed); I need to train it 2 times (Fighting with 50% CP pokemon); which takes considerably longer and uses more resources. Also, this is highly unlikely as friendly gym poke has varied CP and it is mostly impossible to train all 3 pokemon at the same time; meaning i need to just attack 1st pokemon 4 times (selecting 6 pokemon to attack 4 times!!).\n\nExample 2:\nTaking down a lvl7 gym - attack 1 turn; 7k lost. gym is lvl 5 - assume maximum time spent on all defenders (90 secs) = 10.5 minutes\n\nImagine this training 1 pokemon (500 prestige gained) to lvl a gym up from lvl7 to lvl8 (20,000 prestige to 30,000 prestige).\n\nYou do the math. Or maybe, don't do it... :D\n\nYour statement; however; is correct for the previous version of the gyms - where you saw all these stagnant lvl 10 gyms? -> people actually spent time to train those. So if you expected to take down a lvl 10 gym; you needed to spend at least 30-45 minutes to do so; similar to what these people had spent doing it.\n\nAlso, keeping 10 gyms all the time is not selfish; it means more effort and better pokemon (excluding all the cheaters). You don't beat (or expect to beat) the Elite4 in games with magikarp, do you? If your pokemon is not strong enough, or you do not have time to take down a gym; you do not do it. Simple game. The game had an ingame mechanic to balance this in the long run; pokemon receives 50% less CP per power up, after lvl30. So, this means that when you hit lvl 30, your pokemon becomes similar CP level with any of the higher level players and can compete fairly.\n\nCurrent gym system completely destroys any point in getting any strong pokemon/powering up pokemon. Only point of the current game is completing pokedex, which is lame imo.\n\nIn the end, it is just a game; no need to be upset about it. However, when i see such factually wrong comments; i want to comment on it :D\n\nBtw; you should be a bit less aggressive with the rant. There are married/in relationship people here; you might be the person jerking off, crying about not getting into gyms before :))\n", "id": "da3qyj9"}], [{"comment": "> Training takes some effort now AS IT SHOULD\n\nOkay, let's be fair here. You have to stand there tapping your screen for a lot longer than before. That's not effort. Nothing about this game is effort worthy of a reaction like this. It's mostly about having the luck of being in an area that has a lot of stuff around, or being willing to pay for it.\n\nAt its core, the entire game is built around two things: (1) getting people to give up their money under the guise of (2) getting people to meet each other (under the guise of playing Pokemon).\n\nThe system they have in place is clearly built under some fantasy premise where *effort* isn't what's at play, but *lots of people* are at play. We aren't supposed to be going it solo to the extent most of us are. The problems we're dealing with are because people aren't playing the way they want anymore, and they don't like that. They won't change the game for it either.\n\nThat said...\n\n> 100 free coins a day\n\nThe fact this exists is... kind of a real wake up call. I don't really begrudge you guys who do it, because I get you must have spent a lot of time to get to that point in the first place, but that realization makes me just want to delete the app, unsubscribe, and go back to Alpha Sapphire to wipe myself clean of this before Sun and Moon come out tomorrow. \n\nI'm proud of the 80 I've barely managed since I started playing and you guys were getting 100 *a day*? I'd be thrilled with *10* a day. Hell, if I could have *1* a day, I'd have more than I do now. Though this is something I've been saying for a while, which is that Niantic can't have the pay-to-win currency only be available to the \"winners.\" Give it *more* to the winners, but freemium games work because they keep free players in with handouts.

Car manufacturers aren't liable only if they can show the user was negligent themselves in using the product. If they find 80% negligence of the driver, the company still owes 20%.

My good friend interned with a firm that strictly represented gun manufacturers. The manufacturer for pepper spray, not a gun but a gun company who produced it, was sued after an officer sprayed a protestor. They owed millions. \nThe bottom line is, there is strict liability for products that injure people, unless you can show that the user used the product negligently. Using your phone and driving is not only negligent, but criminal. \nThere aren't any smoke and mirrors, there are statutes and case law that you can go and read now. Plus the entity that ultimately determines liability is the jury. \nThe lawsuit would never get that far. They are extraordinarily expensive, especially against corporations, and more than an individual can afford.  Class action attorneys could work for contingency, but they would only take a case that has a high probability of winning, and this isn't one of them. Banding together won't raise the funds either.

A person drives their car through a crowd of bicyclist, the automobile manufacturer will not be able held liable due to misuse of the automobile.\n\nI have no knowledge of the pepper spray case, but certainly there can be negligence depending on the case.  Was someone killed or blinded by the intended use of the product?  That is not comparing apples to apples in regards to negligence and liability that we are discussing here with Niantic.\n\nShow me an example of AT&T or Verizon being sued and losing the case because someone was texting and caused an accident.  I am sure people have attempted to sue them in such cases, but 100% of the liability would be the driver who was texting.\n\nAnd sure it is a long shot, lots of things are, but if you continue to allow yourself to be pushed around, you will always be victim.  If someone sells you a product and later takes intentional steps to change the functionality or value of that product after making millions of dollars selling it, you have take to action or you will just be victimized again.", "id": "d9p7v04"}, {"comment": "\"This is not comparing apples to apples in regards to negligence and liability that we are discussing here with niantic\" \nThis is exactly my point and why your examples were bad. You gave examples that require contributory negligence to remove liability. The reason why the manufacturer cannot be held to pay damages in those cases is by reason of negligence of the user. We aren't dealing with that here, which is kind of what your saying, but at the same time, it's what makes your examples irrelevant. I'm not sure you're understanding the connection between negligence and liability here.\nLegal examples that are relevant would be what the other comment said about the car capable of going 200mph and after they released the product capped the speed at 100mph. There is no triable issue there unless they specifically promised a product capable of 200mph, which would be false advertisement. Niantic didn't promise a product that was capable of being used while traveling in any kind of vehicle. Therefore, there is no false advertisement claim to bring. There has to be an ad to present into evidence. The fact that they limited the speed after release is irrelevant. The provision you would look at would be the \"gameplay or software is subject to change by the company\" language. This language is why niantic can make updates to the game, and whether you like the updates or not, its perfectly legal.\nFinal point, good luck convincing a judge and a jury that a company placing safety restrictions on their product that benefit the public as a whole should be held to pay damages because people are unhappy with the outcome in the video game.

Almost all parks and national forests (with the exception of a camping permit) are closed at dark, and thus, off limits. Going to a place that prohibits going there after dark would be considered trespassing and violate the terms and conditions of the game and if caught, you'd likely be banned. I'm thinking Niantec will frame a similar condition in Pokemon Go. The community self polices regarding access times to parks. Since all actions are recorded and public, other players can see you tagging a portal or blowing them up, and if you're in an area you shouldn't be, you'll be called out. I'm thinking Pokemon Go would have this capability as well. \n\nThat said, anything after dark would be mostly limited to areas the public does have access to, which are typically deemed safe. \n\nStopping people from breaking trespassing laws is another matter entirely. I'd say it's an individual's responsibility to be aware of posted times and when they may or may not enter an area after dark. \n\nWith forests during the day, I'd say people should be aware of their limits. Obviously if you can't climb a certain rock or climb a tree, you're not getting very far enough to damage yourself. But if you do climb, you're most likely trained in climbing and should already know well enough that you don't whip out the phone in the middle of a climb.  \n\nTreking through the wilderness isn't that hard, it's all about awareness of your surroundings. Hazards are only apparent when you go off the path, but if you do, you'll have your hands full so you wound't really be taking interest in that phone anyway.    \n\nAlso, most wilderness areas won't have a reception.  There's a reason I love to camp and 'unplug' while I do so.  \n\nTo address your point on inner city areas would be a different safety matter entirely. I think the best thing is to use common sense, which I'm hoping most people will use. \n\nI do have a prediction, through playing Ingress, on mechanics of the game that may lighten some fears. Niantec utilizes cumulative cell phone data on where it distributes XM, a sort of 'fuel' for actions you do in the game. The more XM, the more likely other people have used a cell phone there. You'll see these in city centers and traffic intersections where people use their phone (but shouldn't). They also come out of portals, but that's the thing, portals get placed by people that have this game too. \n\nI'm about to make a slight generalization here, but I base it on the types of people I've met playing the game in my own area in Virginia and from the next state over in Maryland. Many that play are the high tech well to do crowd as you need to have a good income to pay the phone bill that covers the data plan and money required to pay for the travel this game promotes. Doing some comparisons of portal density over a household income map, you see higher clusters of portals placed where higher earnings are as opposed to much fewer portals over areas with lower earnings. In this area, the lower income areas are often associated with the higher rates of crime. This can't be replicated for rural areas since income doesn't correlate with crime outside metropolitan areas.  \n\nBut what I'm getting at, is that by observing where people play in the DC area, people will play where other like minded people live, which are in typically good neighborhoods with much less crime.  If the game supports user generated 'spawn points' for pokemon like with Ingress' portals, then I think most players should be fine. If Niantec creates their own spawn points, I highly suspect they will use their collected cell phone data to place them in areas where phones are constantly used. Areas with high crime tend to be avoided by Ingress players for their own safety and that it's less likely people from these areas will be playing themselves because they're more likely to not have the means to play a game supported by an expensive data plan. \n\n"], [1, "You can lawyer out common sense.

However, we don't have any information so who knows, this could actually be a problem.\n\nRegarding the rest of your points, I think it's just a matter of people using their head. The only one I would actually be worried about is people going deeper into hiking trails, or even off the trail, to go after a pokemon when they're not familiar with the area. I believe this one could be a danger mostly because people already do this just to snap a good photo of something, or because they think they can manage and there are other hikers crowding them on the trail.\n\nI'm not sure Go would make this risk MORE prevalent in and of itself, I just know it's already a risk, and with more novice hikers potentially walking on trails it suddenly has a higher chance of happening"], [1, "I guess that releasing the game as designed for 12+ year old persons should already limits the risk of young children running around with it.

There's a reason I love to camp and 'unplug' while I do so.  \n\nTo address your point on inner city areas would be a different safety matter entirely. I think the best thing is to use common sense, which I'm hoping most people will use. \n\nI do have a prediction, through playing Ingress, on mechanics of the game that may lighten some fears. Niantec utilizes cumulative cell phone data on where it distributes XM, a sort of 'fuel' for actions you do in the game. The more XM, the more likely other people have used a cell phone there. You'll see these in city centers and traffic intersections where people use their phone (but shouldn't). They also come out of portals, but that's the thing, portals get placed by people that have this game too. \n\nI'm about to make a slight generalization here, but I base it on the types of people I've met playing the game in my own area in Virginia and from the next state over in Maryland. Many that play are the high tech well to do crowd as you need to have a good income to pay the phone bill that covers the data plan and money required to pay for the travel this game promotes. Doing some comparisons of portal density over a household income map, you see higher clusters of portals placed where higher earnings are as opposed to much fewer portals over areas with lower earnings. In this area, the lower income areas are often associated with the higher rates of crime. This can't be replicated for rural areas since income doesn't correlate with crime outside metropolitan areas.  \n\nBut what I'm getting at, is that by observing where people play in the DC area, people will play where other like minded people live, which are in typically good neighborhoods with much less crime.  If the game supports user generated 'spawn points' for pokemon like with Ingress' portals, then I think most players should be fine. If Niantec creates their own spawn points, I highly suspect they will use their collected cell phone data to place them in areas where phones are constantly used. Areas with high crime tend to be avoided by Ingress players for their own safety and that it's less likely people from these areas will be playing themselves because they're more likely to not have the means to play a game supported by an expensive data plan. \n\n", "id": "d0zlf9i"}], [{"comment": "You can lawyer out common sense.

The only one I would actually be worried about is people going deeper into hiking trails, or even off the trail, to go after a pokemon when they're not familiar with the area.

In a residential area of the city, pokemon barely spawn for me so I can't catch much unless I leave the house. And when I can catch something the game treats those areas as IRL Pallet Town hence why I was seeing alot of pidgeys, rattatas, zubats etc. \n\nPokestops have to be located in publicly accessible areas which is why cities have more of them than suburban areas where it is rows and rows of housing without unique points of interest.

I have firsthand experience of playing Pokemon GO in both a rural area (where I live) and in a nearby town, and I can say from that experience that playing in the countryside is much worse than in a populated town.\n\nSo once again, I think Pokemon should spawn at an even rate everywhere, which they currently don't.", "id": "d5f6zlc"}, {"comment": "While this sounds fine, I feel that what they're doing is actually more-or-less the correct way of handling spawns.\nI live in a decent sized town currently, there's maybe a dozen gyms and a few dozen stops, most of which are clustered in 3 different parts of town.\n\nHowever, I grew in up a town that has (to my knowledge) absolutely nothing in it. If I was growing up in that town with this game, I'd be super annoyed that the game is imbalanced in this way.\n\nAt the same time we have to realize that the existing pokemon need to be tracked by the server. It would be pointless to have them spawn everywhere, including deserts or the middle of the ocean, when there isn't a soul around for 50+ miles. \n\nWhat needs to be happening (and presumably is) is that the game spawns pokemon around areas where people are connecting from.. ONLY those areas. We can then say \"1 pokemon per person in this area per 3 minutes, max 10 within a certain range\" - this leads to more pokemon in crowded areas, but rightfully so. Not all of the people will reach all of these pokemon, maybe instead they reach 4-6 every 5 minutes. While the lone person in the middle of nowhere is getting ~2 pokemon in that same timeframe.\n\nTHEN what needs to happen is diversity. But the diversity is mostly RNG with maybe a little bit based on coordinates. With more people, you get more chances at diversity. This is unfortunate for the few people living in the middle of nowhere, but it makes sense.\n\nWhat we SHOULD have is the ability to continue making requests for stops/gyms. If a request is made for a gym where no other gym exists for ~ 1 mile, or a stop where one doesn't exist for ~.5 miles, then it should automatically be placed. These stops should then generate 1 pokemon per 5-10 minutes if there is connectivity to the game in that area (counting as +1 person in this scenario). This would reduce the server load from your idea of spawning them everywhere, while still offering something to people in rural areas... even if it's a little less than populated areas. \n\nHOWEVER!\nNiantic's priority list should really be:\n\n1) Server upgrades/stability\n\n2) Game availability in other areas (once existing servers are handled and stable)\n\n3) Bug fixes that would probably be simple to fix (footstep issue, razz-curve issue unless that's a 'feature', frozen ball glitch, etc.)\n\n4) Adding pokestops/gyms/spawns to rural areas.\n\nI say this because appealing to the 100,000's of players in the major areas take precedence over the 10 here and the 20 there, who while combined make up a large group of people, still makes up the minority of the player base.\n\nTL;DR\n\n- Offered a solution for rural areas, but main gameplay and server stability should take priority over extending where the game can be played. Then extending where it can be played should take priority over handling rural areas, due to the overall % of the player base that is affected by these changes. (Gameplay / stability = 100% player base, extra regions < 100% player base, rural areas < extra region player base)", "id": "d5f8kbe"}, {"comment": "That's a good idea. Maybe not spawn Pokemon everywhere, but spawn them around people that play the game. So it feels like it's balanced between cities and rural areas, but the areas with no players are empty.\n\nEDIT: Reread your post and realized you're saying Niantic is doing it right already. I have to disagree with that. When Pokemon spawn in, everyone in the area can catch it - not just the first person. Therefore, if spawns are the same everywhere, people in cities still have access to just as many Pokemon as people in rural areas. It's unfair for people in towns and cities to be catching Pokemon more often than people farther away.\n\nAlso, people in rural areas aren't getting ~2 Pokemon every 5 minutes. It's more like 0-1.", "id": "d5fb0sy"}, {"comment": "I don't really know the exact rates, I was giving it as an example of what it *should* be going at. Something reasonable that will keep people playing and trying to 'catch them all' for an extended duration. We don't want 1 pokemon every 30 seconds, that would get boring fast. But 1-2 every 5 minutes feels reasonable.\n\nI also can't support the \"One person per pokemon\" theory, as people with better phones/providers would have a strict advantage. Keeping it where everybody sees the pokemon (or it exists until it despawns, only not showing for those who already caught that instance of it) is the way to go. \n\nI was saying I think they're doing it right, for the most part, in the sense that they spawn more pokemon where there are more players. If there's also a cap on how many can show within a certain range of eachother (say no more than 10 in a 1 mile radius at any given time) then it's okay, since it limits the advantage of being in a crowded area as opposed to being solo. If we made it 'first come first serve', the game is instantly rewarding those with more money(better devices/providers), or those who live in the middle of nowhere. However, that might reduce server load.. I'm not entirely sure. \n\nDo we know how it tracks which instanced pokemon you've caught? Is it device-side or server-side? If it's device-side, it's likely to get abused. If it's server-side it can lead to congestion in crowded areas (all those videos with 500+ people rushing to a rare pokemon come to mind..)\n\nIf it's stored server side, perhaps it could be limited to \"First 10 people\" or something, though in large gatherings that still becomes problematic for people like myself with weak devices.\n\n", "id": "d5fbsf1"}, {"comment": "Oh, I thought you were saying that in rural areas it should be around 2 Pokemon per 5 minutes and cities should have 4-5 per 5 minutes. Whatever the rate is, I think it should be the same whether you're in or out of a city.\n\nI never said only one person should be able to see the Pokemon. I was just stating that everyone can see Pokemon and everyone can capture them. That's a good thing IMO. Sorry if that was confusing.\n\nHowever, they shouldn't spawn more Pokemon where there are more players due to what I said in the paragraph above. If there are the same number of Pokemon in cities as in the countryside, then everyone can get approximately the same number of Pokemon wherever they are (city or countryside), and that would be a good thing. If more Pokemon spawn in more populated areas, any given city resident will get more Pokemon than any given person in the countryside.\n\nI'm not sure, but I think tracking is server-side. I heard that Niantic temporarily disabled tracking so all 3 pawprints show up no matter how far away you are in order to decrease server load. And with all those hacks coming out so people can play Pokemon from their couch, I'm sure someone would've come up with a hack to show all nearby Pokemon if it were client-side.", "id": "d5fcpxb"}, {"comment": "There's nothing.

You get to the end game way too quickly, and people who live near them are all down to finding their last few Pok\u00e9mon, likely months before generation two will be out -- the timing is all wrong. You can see that with some of the you-tubers -- once you finish your pokedex (other than regionals) it's hard to play the game regularly.

People at the hotspots were never playing the same game as the rest of us, and it was a quicker and inevitably shorter lived game. Sure it's fun for a night to run around catching rares you wouldn't see anywhere else but this is really designed to be a game of grinding -- it's why you need hundreds of Pok\u00e9mon candies to evolve many Pok\u00e9mon, why stardust is always in short supply, why some are supposed to be rarer to see than others, and why you need hundreds of thousands of experience points to level up. It's a game that Niantic needs to last months between big updates, and arguably is a game of patience, not immediate rewards. You aren't supposed to find multiple Dragonites on a Saturday night, you are supposed to spend months thrilled whenever you come across those rare Dratini spawns.

So if Santa Monica is on the demise (which I bet is an exaggeration), that's maybe a good thing -- a flame that burned so hot it was burning itself out anyhow -- and more of a correction than anything else.

Maybe at least 5-6 mons before the prestige costs increase substantially or boons to help Defenders hold and mean something in order to actually try and boost a gym's prestige so it isn't getting trashed in 1-2 minutes with upwards of seven different 'mons ALL attacking the defenders 'mons one by one. By the time your group can prestige up even a few hundred points, the 14+ other players are just tearing through what you gained and your best defense literally becomes sniping as fast as you can when it falls. Literally, you cannot even prestige fast enough to add a fourth 'mon at the moment.\n\nA lockout to prevent attacking and sniping might help and allow the new conquerors plan out their team and increase the CP of it. The only issue I can see is that both teams that currently do not hold the gym can strike together against the Defender,: How do you determine who has the rights to claiming it? Most damage done?\n\nThe current system is okay for gyms that don't rapidly change hands, but in events like this or even in larger cities or areas with a lot of Trainer activity, it's pointless to even train and you're better off sniping for control which is relatively easy by comparison and fairly stale in terms of gameplay: Who has the fastest fingers to toss up their best defender and who currently isn't lagging on their phone by few M/S, wins.

I wanted the reality that if you never explore your city then you would be like Joey Youngster with his 6 Rattata.        \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PokeVision nearly ruined the game; FULL BLOWN CHEATING. It kept me sitting at my computer waiting to see if anything rare spawned in my city. First time turning on PokeVision, I soon realized that I had already captured nearly everything available in my city (Pokedex at 92). So instead of walking outside I just watched the PokeVision waiting for a legendary to pop up. Of course it did not and I'm glad.      \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment Legendary pokemon are added I want it to stay a secret. I want people to see them/catch them and the world to continue to disbelieve it; this way they will continue to be legendary, borderline conspiracy, or myth.

It didn't affect your game. But I am no longer enjoying the game. I'm not going out for the sake of playing. No tracking at all hurts my enjoyment.

You seem to want a scanner not a tracker.  With a tracker,  you have to walk around and wait for something to pop up and then begin looking for it.  This is the way it works now.  Does it tell you exactly where to look? No, but that's why we have community resources to guide each other to nest or hot spots ect.\n\nI feel it's much more realistic the way it is because it has more of a hunting feel to it.

Whereas somebody using a bot just leaves the computer to do everything and they go off to work or whatever.\n\nPeople who sit at pokestops and lure pokemon all day isn't actually cheating though is it. If they want to spend their coins on lures and they want to sit and do that, they are entitled to. It would be like saying sitting at a gym and battling all day is cheating, when it isn't.

But hey, atleast I can tell my friend fucking 30 mins away there's a weedle nearby him.\n\nYeah, and by this logic, with the old sightings menu that ONLY showed pokemon in your direct vicinity you would miss out on rare pokemon at your local pokestop. It's also fascinating that you assume that the pokemon around you that you're now missing out on are rare yet the pokestops a ways away are just going to be filled with weedles, despite the fact that the sightings menu only sampled from one spawn area whereas the pokestop tracker samples from up to nine different spawn areas.\n\n>until you realise that there are passengers in a car too.\n\nGod forbid you have to walk in a walking game? The game was never designed to let you sit on your ass and farm dozens of items for free with zero effort.

If this is truly how you think change happens then the next time you find a hair in your meal, go spew insults and obscenities at the waiter and see what happens. $100 says you'd have more success calmly and politely asking for a fix. You'd also not piss off everyone in the diner around you.\n\n>that's how we got Evee to move to 5k eggs and Pidgey & Rattata out of 2k.

Before the update, the game was working for people like me. There's still options for people me, it just involves using 3rd party trackers. \n\nBut even the change seems to conflict with some other implementations that Niantic has provided. For example, the new tracker shows me Pok\u00e9mon that would take about 15 minutes to walk there (according to google maps). Its like Niantic wants people to drive in this situation to get there before the Pok\u00e9mon despawns. But they heavily discourage driving. \n\nThere's plenty of examples of why this is a poorly thought out solution.

I just tried getting back into it just before the Halloween event. I would typically open the app every couple days just to see if anything changed with spawns and such and see if something rare is nearby. I like the idea of the map based scanners/trackers, and here is just a few reasons off the top of my head:\n\n1) I've had a handful of the rare spawns either despawn before I could find them or glitch out and despawn before I even had a chance to throw a pokeball at them because the game wouldn't allow me to tap on them without causing errors and then never saw them again. At least the scanners let me know if I have enough time to reach them and at least give myself a chance to try to catch them and reduce the chance of wasting my time\n\n2) A lot of the stuff I am typically looking for, if it does spawn nearby, is in the middle of someone's backyard and out of range when I am walking down the street/sidewalk. I don't want to be that person hopping people's fences or walking in circles to find something that I can't reach. If it wasn't for the scanners, I'd be blindly looking for something that I shouldn't be attempting to get, legally, and out of respect for the property owners.\n\n3) It's been between 30-45 degrees for the most part the last couple weeks and snowed a few times. Winter hasn't even begun yet, it will get much colder here and it will stay that way until March/April. Blindly looking for these Pokemon when half of them are on someone's property or might glitch out isn't fun when you can't even feel your fingers.\n\n4) Niantic keeps adding new spawns and then removing others so I have no real indication of where anything would normally spawn after a new update, if that new spawn is even accessible anyways. In the newest patch, they took probably 1/3 of the street/front yard spawns out of my neighborhood and placed a few more behind houses that aren't accessible if you don't live in them.\n\nIt isn't so much as cheating as it is trying not to waste time or staying out of legal trouble for some people that live in the country/suburbs and not major cities where you find 25 different pokemon on each corner. I can't tell you how many Abras/Squirtles/Pikachus/Dratinis I've had on my nearby, just to see that on a scanner they are in someone's backyard that you can't reach by walking down the sidewalk. The spawn points are terrible. And they spawn in my area maybe once or twice a day on a good day.\n\nThese issues could easily be fixed, the problem is that Niantic hasn't done anything about it, in fact, they've made it worse by taking away available spawns and reducing the bloom of the scan in game, literally the opposite of what we need. To top it off, the latest patch increased the time that they are spawned in for, so the ones that aren't accessible are just sitting there instead of respawning somewhere that I can get to them. Most people are starting to believe they won't do anything to make it better, because if it doesn't involve Niantic making money off of businesses with Pokestops, they don't seem to care. So why not better our own experience while we can? The trackers let me know that there's no point aimlessly looking for that Squirtle I desperately need when I can't legally get to it because it is on private property, so I simply move on to something I can get without wasting my time."], [3, "Well, using no trackers at all, I don't even bother going to search around if something good pops up.

I would check it on my PC at home to see spawn rates of nearby areas.  Admittedly, if I saw something like a Dragonite spawn in the shopping center near me with a 10 minute timer, yeah I might hop in the car and try to get there, but I've never seen such.  Closest of such an encounter was seeing a wild Gyarados on the map, but that was while scouting spawns at a different shopping center 10-15 minutes down the road.\n\nBut honestly, the research is good.  Because I live in a suburban area, I got burned pretty hard at the start of the game trying to go to different parks and checking out various historic pokestops, because I'd get there only to find very little spawn at all.  When trackers started appearing, it confirmed what I already knew- that manually exploring places where I *thought* pokemon might/should spawn was a huge waste of time.\n\nThankfully, the increase of spawns in general around here has been pretty good.

Closest of such an encounter was seeing a wild Gyarados on the map, but that was while scouting spawns at a different shopping center 10-15 minutes down the road.\n\nBut honestly, the research is good.  Because I live in a suburban area, I got burned pretty hard at the start of the game trying to go to different parks and checking out various historic pokestops, because I'd get there only to find very little spawn at all.  When trackers started appearing, it confirmed what I already knew- that manually exploring places where I *thought* pokemon might/should spawn was a huge waste of time.\n\nThankfully, the increase of spawns in general around here has been pretty good.  I was quite surprised when I noticed five spawns at once while just cruising neighborhood streets, which had never happened before.  As it turns out, there's less need for a tracker map when you actually can just stumble upon some decent spawn, which wasn't ever possible for me previously.", "id": "d9obwry"}], [{"comment": "Why don't you go back to their Facebook page where most of the people visiting thinks that this is fine.", "id": "d9odmfe"}, {"comment": "That what is fine ", "id": "d9ojg67"}, {"comment": "Thinks that using 3rd party trackers is cheating and Niantic's shitty new one is the best tracker in the world.", "id": "d9opeg1"}], [{"comment": "Trackers are also good in understanding the biomes of areas that The Silph Road doesn't want to capitalize on. \n\nWhen I was in Vegas, I used a Now-Borked Tracker to figure out that Vegas is littered with Desert-ish Mons: Rattata, Ekans, Paras, Meowths, and Tauros, with random oddballs like Vulpix, Rhyhorn, Venonat, and a few others that aren't clicking in my mind right now.....

Also keep in mind that this subreddit is basically a big witch hunt for things niantic has done wrong. There was a post earlier about how they apparently turned the tick rate from 5 seconds to 10 second for the purpose of messing with third party programs. No information hinted at that being the reason while the real reason was to reduce the load on the servers (the reason they had to temporarily remove tracking). The game is not being broken it is being fixed but because they didn't magically have the answers everyone assumes they are making permanent changes to ruin the game. Majority of the changes they made were to make the server stable so people could at least semi play the game while they fixed issues. The game hasnt even been out for a month yet. Skyrim had more issues than pokemon go had at launch that took a whole year to solve all of them and Niantic is basically a 40 person team.

Instead of an mmorpg that just has a bunch of decorative counters for how many times you clicked on something, I get to see my fitness level improving while having fun with a free app. And that's what I find value in. "], [25, "I agree with you, but I feel like you're also ignoring some things that shouldn't be ignored. \n\nTracker: *Why* isn't there a decent tracker? In San Francisco they have no problem with telling you exactly where a pokemon is and letting you go get it. Why do they A) not have any plans to bring that to the rest of the world or B) care so much about 3rd party trackers that do virtually the same thing? Also, yes I usually *do* find the things that I set out to find, but that's because I know where my local spawn points are and have a vague idea of when things pop up a them. It's a matter of looking at the clock and trying to remember where the spawn points are that have pokemon spawned at that time. Is that really how they want you to play the game? \n\n3rd Party trackers: I touched on this already I guess. Yeah, I don't like the idea of people sitting at their computers, waiting for stuff to pop up and hopping in their cars. That's not how the game is meant to be played. I did use FPM for a while before it was disabled, but I used it as and aid for the in game tracker. If I saw something I wanted on sightings and couldn't find it by walking around, I'd use it to locate the pokemon. I know that's not the exact way that the game should be played, but the game does need a tracker and I can't blame people for using one since the sightings list is pretty much useless except for telling you when a pokemon is within 200m or not. \n\nGym stagnation: While for you it might be fine for a gym to be level 10 for a week or so, it locks people out of gyms. On my campus we have 3 gyms, and most of us are Mystic players, though we have a pretty active Instinct playerbase. Usually 1 gym sits at lvl 10 for Mystic for a week or so before instinct takes it down, and in that week, other Mystic players who didn't make the cut in the lvl 10 gym are SOL and forced to get only 20 coins at most per day. For example my girlfriend who started after me is at level 20 and doesn't have many decent pokemon. Hers are the first to leave the gym when it's being battled. When a gym sits at lvl 10, she can't do anything except for wait for the other team to take it down. Whereas I, a lvl 27 player, can be in the mid to upper ranks of a gym and not have to worry about my pokemon getting booted too often. If Instinct tries to chip away at the lvl 10 gym, I'm never first one the chopping block. \n\nThe other issue with stagnated lvl 10 gyms is that it's incredibly costly to take down. In my experience 30 minutes is generous. I have taken upwards of an hour to solo beat a level 10 gym, although it was particularly stacked. And I used a shit ton of potions and revives in the process. We don't have many pokestops in town or on campus, so getting new items is slow. Plus, it forces people who haven't bought storage upgrades to choose between pokeballs or potions/revives. The higher level a gym, the more items it requires to take down. I've walked away from beating high level gyms with 40 or so revives after starting with 100+. I'm fortunate enough to live on a pokestop so I can get pretty much all the items I need, but most people don't, and I know that personally my friends struggle to battle because they don't have items. If we want to take a gym, I'll have to be conscious that they might not be able to revive their pokemon. \n\nWhat's even worse is that in rural areas where there aren't many pokestops, gyms are usually stagnant more because people don't have the resources to do anything about it. \n\nSo in total, I agree that the current sightings is somewhat sufficient, but it's not at all the ideal way to track pokemon (I'm wanting a compass based tracker fwiw). I'm neutral on 3rd party trackers, until Niantic gives us a decent in game tracker. I think gym stagnation is worse than ever before. It's easier to train up a gym than it is to battle it down.

I'm also a player who prefers to play the game on foot or on a bike, and doesn't understand the fun in using an online tracker.\nHowever, the issues here are different for me.\n\nFirst off,  the online trackers. Niantic's methods to try to shut them down are sketchy to say the least, adding code that will lag the game, banning rooted phones and Blackberry phones. Someone who cheats doesn't impact the playing experience of people who play legit so why do they focus so much on this? The only way cheaters will impact others really is by gym sniping by gps spoofing (which is solved by thinking logically; have it so only the attacker of the gym can take it afterwards with a timer!!).\nAlso the new ban on going a certain km/h sucks, even though I don't play in the car much it was fun when I did that occasionally (as a passenger of course), but most important I have a friend who would play on the bus a lot. Just because you have a vision of how your game should be played shouldn't mean you force that on all the players.\n\nFinally, the worst thing about the whole gym stagnation thing is how tedious and annoying it is to train the gyms, it's more menuing than battling!

In San Francisco they have no problem with telling you exactly where a pokemon is and letting you go get it. Why do they A) not have any plans to bring that to the rest of the world or B) care so much about 3rd party trackers that do virtually the same thing? Also, yes I usually *do* find the things that I set out to find, but that's because I know where my local spawn points are and have a vague idea of when things pop up a them. It's a matter of looking at the clock and trying to remember where the spawn points are that have pokemon spawned at that time. Is that really how they want you to play the game? \n\n3rd Party trackers: I touched on this already I guess. Yeah, I don't like the idea of people sitting at their computers, waiting for stuff to pop up and hopping in their cars. That's not how the game is meant to be played. I did use FPM for a while before it was disabled, but I used it as and aid for the in game tracker. If I saw something I wanted on sightings and couldn't find it by walking around, I'd use it to locate the pokemon. I know that's not the exact way that the game should be played, but the game does need a tracker and I can't blame people for using one since the sightings list is pretty much useless except for telling you when a pokemon is within 200m or not. \n\nGym stagnation: While for you it might be fine for a gym to be level 10 for a week or so, it locks people out of gyms. On my campus we have 3 gyms, and most of us are Mystic players, though we have a pretty active Instinct playerbase. Usually 1 gym sits at lvl 10 for Mystic for a week or so before instinct takes it down, and in that week, other Mystic players who didn't make the cut in the lvl 10 gym are SOL and forced to get only 20 coins at most per day. For example my girlfriend who started after me is at level 20 and doesn't have many decent pokemon. Hers are the first to leave the gym when it's being battled. When a gym sits at lvl 10, she can't do anything except for wait for the other team to take it down. Whereas I, a lvl 27 player, can be in the mid to upper ranks of a gym and not have to worry about my pokemon getting booted too often. If Instinct tries to chip away at the lvl 10 gym, I'm never first one the chopping block. \n\nThe other issue with stagnated lvl 10 gyms is that it's incredibly costly to take down. In my experience 30 minutes is generous. I have taken upwards of an hour to solo beat a level 10 gym, although it was particularly stacked. And I used a shit ton of potions and revives in the process. We don't have many pokestops in town or on campus, so getting new items is slow. Plus, it forces people who haven't bought storage upgrades to choose between pokeballs or potions/revives. The higher level a gym, the more items it requires to take down. I've walked away from beating high level gyms with 40 or so revives after starting with 100+. I'm fortunate enough to live on a pokestop so I can get pretty much all the items I need, but most people don't, and I know that personally my friends struggle to battle because they don't have items. If we want to take a gym, I'll have to be conscious that they might not be able to revive their pokemon. \n\nWhat's even worse is that in rural areas where there aren't many pokestops, gyms are usually stagnant more because people don't have the resources to do anything about it. \n\nSo in total, I agree that the current sightings is somewhat sufficient, but it's not at all the ideal way to track pokemon (I'm wanting a compass based tracker fwiw). I'm neutral on 3rd party trackers, until Niantic gives us a decent in game tracker. I think gym stagnation is worse than ever before. It's easier to train up a gym than it is to battle it down.

I think a better solution would be that the first person to enter a pokemon in a gym becomes the leader, and the 2nd person is #2 in the gym, and the 3rd becomes #3 and so on. So if you're last to the gym but have a 3500 Dragonite, you're still first on the chopping block.

I'm also a player who prefers to play the game on foot or on a bike, and doesn't understand the fun in using an online tracker.\nHowever, the issues here are different for me.\n\nFirst off,  the online trackers. Niantic's methods to try to shut them down are sketchy to say the least, adding code that will lag the game, banning rooted phones and Blackberry phones. Someone who cheats doesn't impact the playing experience of people who play legit so why do they focus so much on this? The only way cheaters will impact others really is by gym sniping by gps spoofing (which is solved by thinking logically; have it so only the attacker of the gym can take it afterwards with a timer!!).\nAlso the new ban on going a certain km/h sucks, even though I don't play in the car much it was fun when I did that occasionally (as a passenger of course), but most important I have a friend who would play on the bus a lot. Just because you have a vision of how your game should be played shouldn't mean you force that on all the players.\n\nFinally, the worst thing about the whole gym stagnation thing is how tedious and annoying it is to train the gyms, it's more menuing than battling! Even though this issue was still there before when attacking, they still did this change!

I just tried getting back into it just before the Halloween event. I would typically open the app every couple days just to see if anything changed with spawns and such and see if something rare is nearby. I like the idea of the map based scanners/trackers, and here is just a few reasons off the top of my head:\n\n1) I've had a handful of the rare spawns either despawn before I could find them or glitch out and despawn before I even had a chance to throw a pokeball at them because the game wouldn't allow me to tap on them without causing errors and then never saw them again. At least the scanners let me know if I have enough time to reach them and at least give myself a chance to try to catch them and reduce the chance of me wasting my time\n\n2) A lot of the stuff I am typically looking for, if it does spawn nearby, is in the middle of someone's backyard and out of range when I am walking down the street/sidewalk. I don't want to be that person hopping people's fences or walking in circles to find something that I can't reach. If it wasn't for the scanners, I'd be blindly looking for something that I shouldn't be attempting to get, legally, and out of respect for the property owners.\n\n3) It's been between 30-45 degrees for the most part the last couple weeks and snowed a few times. Winter hasn't even begun yet, it will get much colder here and it will stay that way until March/April. Blindly looking for these Pokemon when half of them are on someone's property or might glitch out isn't fun when you can't even feel your fingers.\n\n4) Niantic keeps adding new spawns and then removing others so I have no real indication of where anything would normally spawn after a new update.

He was a pretty young and healthy pup as far as we knew. The vet had no concerns at his most recent checkup. Unfortunately, today I got the worst call of my life. He collapsed out of nowhere, was rushed to the vet but sadly didn't make it. The picture on the left is the last picture I took of him. It was last night when I found out a Dragonite spawned close to my neighborhood. I grabbed Juno, threw him in the car, and we went and caught my first and only Dragonite. As you can see in the picture on the right, I renamed that Dragonite \"Juno\" today and made him my buddy. I'll never change out my buddy as long as I play this game, so that I can keep walking \"Juno.\" Since the app came out he has been my partner in crime for pokemon hunting while my fianc\u00e9e was working night shifts.

I got Gidget when I started middle school just a year or so before the Pokemon craze took over, and I sort of always thought of her as being my Pikachu in a way, haha, so having to let her go instantly brought me back to that episode of the show.\n\nAnyway, after she died, I listened to that song in the episode about \"the time has come to say goodbye\" and bawled my eyes out.

They don't drink water near where they eat because in nature any water source near their kill could be contaminated so putting the water source farther away from the food bowl is ideal as well as having them out of visual range of each other.\n\n2. They don't drink stagnant water because they know it could make them sick so always make sure that you have a drinking fountain that is moving water constantly as opposed to a bowl. Many cats will even start drinking from the stream of water as opposed to the bowl area below. This is also why cats will drink out of the toilet even if you have a water bowl out for them. They know that the toilet moves water and they can taste the difference in the water as well because it is more aerated and better tasting than the water that has been sitting in their bowl not moving for 12+ hours.\n\nFeeding them wet food is a good supplement but you should always make sure to place and present the food and water appropriately as it can have a very positive effect on your pets health.", "id": "d88xaox"}, {"comment": "Seriously this.

From there they got him an xray and noticed his heart was failing him (diagnosed with heart disease) and was told he had 6 months to live. 2 day later, he passed away in his sleep, worst feeling to come home to after work.\n\nFor every dog owner out there, if you happen to notice anything out of the ordinary, it doesn't hurt to get them checked out. As I read more about heart diseases, the signs were all there and I felt like I acted too late, even though I was told there was nothing I could've done to prevent it. Even so, I wish I knew sooner. I didn't think any of it because Lucas was only 5 years old, so I thought he was healthy, but things happen.\n\nIf you're unsure what to look for. These are the signs I've noticed that were on par with this site: http://m.petmd.com/dog/slideshows/general_health/top-ten-signs-of-heart-disease-in-dogs . \n\nPlease hug your little buddies, and show them some extra love for me. Trainer out, have a great day everyone.\"\n\n", "id": "d883kor"}, {"comment": "\"Some of you, particularly those who think they have recently lost a dog to 'death', don\u2019t really understand this. I\u2019ve had no desire to explain, but won\u2019t be around forever and must.\n\nDogs never die. They don\u2019t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don\u2019t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say: 'No, no, not a good idea. Let's not go for a walk.' Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that's what dogs are. They walk.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog\u2019s mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you. That\u2019s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.\n\nHowever, dogs get very very sleepy. That\u2019s the thing, you see. They don't teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It\u2019s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.\n\nWhen you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging its tail madly, you see, and that\u2019s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That\u2019s when they say: 'Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.'\n\nWhen they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that\u2019s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it\u2019s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it's a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)\n\nAnyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don\u2019t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.\n\nBut don\u2019t get fooled. They are not 'dead.' There\u2019s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you\u2019re not expecting it. It\u2019s just who they are.\n\nI feel sorry for people who don\u2019t have dogs sleeping in their heart. You\u2019ve missed so much.

I will wipe you the fuck out with Pokemon the likes of which has never been seen before on Pokemon Go, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with posting that shit to Pokemon Go subreddit? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my elite network of Team Instinct hackers across the globe and all of your team that's at a gym is being transferred to Professor Willow right now so you better prepare for the thunderstorm, weedle. The thunderstorm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your hobby. You're fucking done with, youngster. I can be anywhere, anytime, without GPS spoofing and I can take you out with over seven hundred different Pokemon, and that's just with the vanilla android version. Not only do I have one inferior android account, but I have access to the entire devkit tools for Go on my iPad to and I will use them to their full extent to make it so that way you can't go to any Gym without there being a CP 3000+ Zapdos with unavoidable attacks waiting for you, you grimer-candy-hungry breeder. If only you could have known what thunderous retribution your little clever Anti-Instinct comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you wouldn't have gone to reddit to post it in the first place. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now your team is destroyed, you goddamn ruin maniac. I will shit thunder all over you and your phone will die.

Forget pokestops and gyms, just saying \"hey, the spawn rate shouldn't go below this.\" At its most basic, or \"the most busy area in any 30 minute radius should be at least this busy\" on the more difficult to code side.\n\nWith my dev hat on I would agree that time spent to fix issues for fewer players go further down the list, but I would also say the most complained about issue is less of an issue if there are more pokemon to catch, and that spawn rates is not generally a hard thing to code. They seem to be alright with a full on flood of pokemon some places, why not alter the variable on the lower side of the curve?\n\nDon't take that as an outright rejection of what you've noted. I'm interested if there's something more to it in your point of view. They have areas with plenty spawning and areas with few, I don't envision it as difficult to skew. I've made some games from on my TI83 through to some gamification of process for my work and spawn/encounter rates were never a difficult area to adjust. It may be that they have a much more robust plan they hope to work but once again I am not sure why a temp adjustment would be out of the easy fix realm on the agile board or whatever. \"Quick wins\" is a label for fixes where I work, whether a more robust change can go in the next major release or not.", "id": "d5zzyg6"}, {"comment": "It isn't hard to code from a coding perspective, but it is very hard given that spawning mechanics are based on cellular data and if you add something in addition to that it will break the game.

If number of pokemon brings down the servers then ceiling should also be on the cutting block as we've seen the images of insane numbers a foot away from eachother. In that case floor and ceiling together would just spread them out a bit, without undue strain.\n\nI do accept server traffic as a hold back, though.\n\nI'd also note that based on what we know they already track in packets based on existing items and the notification, buzzing, for new pokemon on the screen I'm certain a few lines of code using packets already sent and information that we know exchanges hands could be turned into a fun and balanced minimum pokemon solution without undue server load in regards to cell usage, spawn rates, etc.\n\nIn any case, more servers is likely the vision of a fix on their end due to player base being beyond planned, which is separate from development, so the code would be written but delayed in my mind.\n\nFun stuff, I'm interested in seeing the methods they use.
