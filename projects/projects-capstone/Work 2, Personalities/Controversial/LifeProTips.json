What's going on?\"\n\n\"[New attractive co-worker] is really upset because she thinks that you do not like her.

She's really upset and she thinks you don't like her.\"\n\n\"No boss, you don't understand. I like her. I like her A LOT. But I have a wife and three kids, and I can't AFFORD to like her. So yes, I absolutely minimize the amount of contact that I have with her.\"\n\nMy dad's boss looked at him for a moment and burst out laughing, and said, \"Okay. I'll talk with her.\"\n\nThe moral of the story, as my dad told it, is that just because you are married, it doesn't mean that you will never meet people that you are attracted to. But as a married person, and especially as a parent, it is YOUR responsibility to make sure that nothing ever happens that will jeopardize your spouse's happiness and the sanctity of your family.\n\nEdit:  My dad worked for that particular company for 37 years and he was married to my mom for 35, until she passed away.

They are a part of fantasy life.\n\nIn my experience, many (if not most) people need an active fantasy life of some sort.  Often this comes in the form of sports fandom (fantasizing that your support somehow affects the results of your team and that their victories feel like your own), gaming, television shows, or even that your reddit karma really matters.  \n\nCrushes are part of this fantasy life that keeps things lively for us.

Because it's clear then that the individual with a crush just doesn't care anymore, not really, about salvaging things.\n\nAlso, crushes happen regardless of circumstance. Real life is not Disney. Commitment doesn't mean never having a crush, it means accepting that crushes are transient and investing in something more long-lasting. If a marriage lass forty years, I guarantee you that both partners will go through at least two or three crushes each in that time period regardless of the over-all strength of a marriage.

When you're mad at your partner, you usually have a point and it's due to some shortcoming that your partner has. Putting it out there will make your partner look bad. The people who care about you will naturally take your side and think that you're too good for that person. The more it happens, the more they will turn against your relationship, the more they will try to get involved to protect you, and the harder it is for you to fix the relationship with your partner. For example, if you eventually work things out and decide to forgive and forget, now you need to go and convince everybody else to also forgive and forget your partner, because they all know about it and took your side. Sometimes that's an even harder task. My friend ended up breaking up because his family couldn't forgive his girlfriend even though he already did. Now, if you're at a point where you're so distressed that you need to vent, please go ahead. Your mental well-being is much more important than anything else and you can do damage control later.

She would randomly bring him up in conversations like a young girl does when she clearly has a crush on a guy. I kept asking about it and she said they were just friends and neither one would ever be interested in more. \n\nA little time goes by and she asks if it's okay for them to hang out after work sometime and maybe go riding together. I told her I didn't have an issue with it, but I'd at least like to meet him to make sure he seems trustworthy and not some idiot that might get her killed. I met him and he seemed okay. They hung out a few times, but I still couldn't get over the way she talked about it non-stop.\n\nShe would get increasingly defensive when I'd bring it up, which led me to believe it wasn't so innocent. I had a folder on my computer that had some risque pictures I took of her some time before that.

Maybe you really do value your own needs over this relationship, and wouldn't mind breaking up, which is why you might be tempted to give an ultimatum.

When you're mad at your partner, you usually have a point and it's due to some shortcoming that your partner has. Putting it out there will make your partner look bad. The people who care about you will naturally take your side and think that you're too good for that person. The more it happens, the more they will turn against your relationship, the more they will try to get involved to protect you, and the harder it is for you to fix the relationship with your partner. For example, if you eventually work things out and decide to forgive and forget, now you need to go and convince everybody else to also forgive and forget your partner, because they all know about it and took your side. Sometimes that's an even harder task. My friend ended up breaking up because his family couldn't forgive his girlfriend even though he already did. Now, if you're at a point where you're so distressed that you need to vent, please go ahead. Your mental well-being is much more important than anything else and you can do damage control later.

She would randomly bring him up in conversations like a young girl does when she clearly has a crush on a guy. I kept asking about it and she said they were just friends and neither one would ever be interested in more. \n\nA little time goes by and she asks if it's okay for them to hang out after work sometime and maybe go riding together. I told her I didn't have an issue with it, but I'd at least like to meet him to make sure he seems trustworthy and not some idiot that might get her killed. I met him and he seemed okay. They hung out a few times, but I still couldn't get over the way she talked about it non-stop.\n\nShe would get increasingly defensive when I'd bring it up, which led me to believe it wasn't so innocent. I had a folder on my computer that had some risque pictures I took of her some time before that. I went to open it for some \"me\" time one day and noticed one picture looked to be re-sized and edited. I asked about this and she played stupid, saying she has no idea what might have happened.\n\nThis behavior continues and I finally get fed up and start snooping through her phone and facebook. I find text messages talking about how bad they want to screw each other at work, sending naked pictures back and forth, and how things would be so much different if she wasn't married.\n\nSafe to say, I lost it. She swore it was just her fantasizing and she never meant any harm, that she was totally innocent. I got the usual, \"it'll never happen again.\" It ended up just being the first of several instances. \n\nMoral of the story, even if these are innocent in the minds of the person behaving poorly, it has a grand impact on the relationship. We tried counseling, open relationship, and a multitude of ways to find some balance in our relationship. I finally ended it because I couldn't live like that any longer.

If you have a 28-day cycle, Day 1 is when you get your first spots of period blood or cramps.\n\nDays 1-5 (or so) is menstrual time. Once the uterus is cleared out, the *endometrium* {thank you /u/Decemberistz} (comfy bloody womb liner) starts thickening up again day by day (day 6-7). \n\nAs the *endometrial* lining thickens, the egg starts to come out-- I think it's usually between day 7-14 that the actual ovulating occurs. The egg is still in the chute (Fallopian tube), making its way down for the first few days, but you're still fertile while it's up in there.  \n\nI usually have ovulation on day 11 or so. I am getting old, so I often have two ovulations (one on each side) and I feel them (\"mittelschmerz\") so I totally know it's happening.   \n\nThen you have peak fertility from days 8-13, unless you ovulate *again* (which can happen-- a bunch of orgasms can stimulate another ovulation, or, if you are older, your ovaries are like \"SALE! SALE! EVERYTHING MUST GO,\") in which case you might have more days of fertility (8-17) for example. \n\nIf you don't get inseminated/impregnated, the egg comes out, looks around, sees no sperm, and usually dissolves-- this is the \"corpus luteum\" phase, or \"egg body.\" When the egg is reabsorbed, it tells the body \"Not pregnant\" and starts the \"breaking up\" process -- I would guess this is like from days 19-24. \n\nDays 23-28 are pre-period symptoms such as \"PMS,\" weird odors that are like blood, but without blood, discharge. Then the ~~luteum~~ endometrium is worn out, and it's back to Day 1 . . .

"], [3, "I believe this LPT begins a discussion, but cannot begin to fully address the nuances and situational contexts which we use to make decisions across cultural, professional, economic, and interpersonal bounds.\n\nThat being said--As a general guideline for interpersonal relationships, I believe the combination of an *attempt* at realizing how your actions have contributed to a conflict or result,  acknowledging those actions to the offended party, and stating a clear commitment to resolve or prevent the behavior from occurring again is the framework of what makes an effective apology.\n\nThese three things demonstrate personal insight, empathy, personal accountability, and respect for others.\n\nHowever, though we speak of making apologies in this discourse--I believe how and what we receive from them should also be a part of the discussion.\n\nGenerally, while on the receiving end of an apology, I'm receiving insight and a measure of how I will perceive this person as a benefit or threat to what I value.  \n\nThe level of insight, sincerity and corrective action a person conveys in their apology should directly correlate with the level of investment we share in our relationship--light or deeply personal.  \n\nIt is good to keep in mind, though, that the intensity of the transgression and of the relationship both determine the manner in which the apology is received.\n\n\nSometimes you fuck up--and the intensity of the transgression was high or attachment to the relationship was low.  Example:  Cheating on your partner or stealing from work.  An apology in those instances is effective at showing some personal insight, empathy and accountability, but by no means will it guarantee restoration of the relationship.\n\nSometimes the intensity of the transgression is low and attachment level is low.  Example:  You accidentally bump into a stranger or forget to acknowledge a casual acquaintance--a quick apology is appropriate.  A deep one is not.\n\nSometimes--the appropriate level of apology is perplexing and complicated.  You perceive the transgression as low intensity, but the relationship attachment is high--and the party is deeply offended.  An effective apology is determined by listening and communication--so you can understand the offended party's difference in values and work your way from there towards a solution and agreement.\n\nSometimes--the transgression is high intensity and the relationship level is constantly changing or undefined.  Example:  In a professional setting, it's acceptable to acknowledge errors or guffs, but for career security it may also be important to minimize any perception that you yourself have flaws.  Your apology must reflect confidence and accountability--while deflecting any perception of weakness.  Full details of your culpability must be abstracted to some degree, but you can never be perceived as \"passing the buck\".\n\nThis is my LPT and insight as a middle-income American from the mid-Atlantic making moderate income in suburbia.

", "id": "d90u3ec"}], [{"comment": "I believe this LPT begins a discussion, but cannot begin to fully address the nuances and situational contexts which we use to make decisions across cultural, professional, economic, and interpersonal bounds.\n\nThat being said--As a general guideline for interpersonal relationships, I believe the combination of an *attempt* at realizing how your actions have contributed to a conflict or result,  acknowledging those actions to the offended party, and stating a clear commitment to resolve or prevent the behavior from occurring again is the framework of what makes an effective apology.\n\nThese three things demonstrate personal insight, empathy, personal accountability, and respect for others.\n\nHowever, though we speak of making apologies in this discourse--I believe how and what we receive from them should also be a part of the discussion.\n\nGenerally, while on the receiving end of an apology, I'm receiving insight and a measure of how I will perceive this person as a benefit or threat to what I value.  \n\nThe level of insight, sincerity and corrective action a person conveys in their apology should directly correlate with the level of investment we share in our relationship--light or deeply personal.  \n\nIt is good to keep in mind, though, that the intensity of the transgression and of the relationship both determine the manner in which the apology is received.\n\n\nSometimes you fuck up--and the intensity of the transgression was high or attachment to the relationship was low.  Example:  Cheating on your partner or stealing from work.  An apology in those instances is effective at showing some personal insight, empathy and accountability, but by no means will it guarantee restoration of the relationship.\n\nSometimes the intensity of the transgression is low and attachment level is low.  Example:  You accidentally bump into a stranger or forget to acknowledge a casual acquaintance--a quick apology is appropriate.  A deep one is not.\n\nSometimes--the appropriate level of apology is perplexing and complicated.  You perceive the transgression as low intensity, but the relationship attachment is high--and the party is deeply offended.  An effective apology is determined by listening and communication--so you can understand the offended party's difference in values and work your way from there towards a solution and agreement.\n\nSometimes--the transgression is high intensity and the relationship level is constantly changing or undefined.  Example:  In a professional setting, it's acceptable to acknowledge errors or guffs, but for career security it may also be important to minimize any perception that you yourself have flaws.  Your apology must reflect confidence and accountability--while deflecting any perception of weakness.  Full details of your culpability must be abstracted to some degree, but you can never be perceived as \"passing the buck\".\n\nThis is my LPT and insight as a middle-income American from the mid-Atlantic making moderate income in suburbia.

Soon after he lost his job (because of drinking on the job) and had to move in with his parents at age 35. I visited as often as I could, but I could see the alcohol was taking over. Not long after that his father got alcohol related dementia (this is a drinking Irish family) which forced him into hospice care (but not before my friend had to clean up his shit now and then). Then his father died in front of him. My friend switch from drinking 20-30 beers a day to drinking vodka straight most likely due to the depression. I got a call one day from a mutual friend that he was in the hospital. He got alcohol poisoning and had a seizure. He was on life support when I came to visit him. He was in a coma like state for one week, followed by a week of being delusional. He didn't know where he was or who we were. He would see visions like flying candles and other odd things. He was in restraints because he kept trying to escape. The doctors couldn't say if he would ever regain his normal mind or memories. We were all extremely sad.\n\nThen one day I got the call that he was released. I visited him and he was somber, but happy to be alive and I could tell it was the same friend I knew. His mother had become ill and he made the decision to go stone cold sober to take care of her. The first time I went to a friends birthday party with him you better believe I didn't drink in front of him, regardless of the fact he said it was okay. As a friend I don't need to be the one to put that temptation in front of him.

I watched one of my best friends become more and more dependent on alcohol. Me and him were very close and we had a tight bond, until I got divorced and lost my house which forced me to move to another city. Soon after he lost his job (because of drinking on the job) and had to move in with his parents at age 35. I visited as often as I could, but I could see the alcohol was taking over. Not long after that his father got alcohol related dementia (this is a drinking Irish family) which forced him into hospice care (but not before my friend had to clean up his shit now and then). Then his father died in front of him. My friend switch from drinking 20-30 beers a day to drinking vodka straight most likely due to the depression. I got a call one day from a mutual friend that he was in the hospital. He got alcohol poisoning and had a seizure. He was on life support when I came to visit him. He was in a coma like state for one week, followed by a week of being delusional. He didn't know where he was or who we were. He would see visions like flying candles and other odd things. He was in restraints because he kept trying to escape. The doctors couldn't say if he would ever regain his normal mind or memories. We were all extremely sad.\n\nThen one day I got the call that he was released. I visited him and he was somber, but happy to be alive and I could tell it was the same friend I knew. His mother had become ill and he made the decision to go stone cold sober to take care of her. The first time I went to a friends birthday party with him you better believe I didn't drink in front of him, regardless of the fact he said it was okay. As a friend I don't need to be the one to put that temptation in front of him. I'd quit drinking entirely if I knew it would save his life. \n\nSo to all the people on their high horse saying \"it's my life damnit\" or whatever bullshit you're spewing, think about someone you love and ask yourself what you think is really right in that situation.

You'll probably end up in a situation where you will need to use them occasionally, but most of the time they will be provided by your hotel and you can always buy some from the store if you need to.

They try to approach relationships with absolute equality. Confidence, and manliness should go hand in hand.\n\nI stated very clearly that I am not speaking in absolutes. There are exceptions, which I stated. There are relationships that are more equal, there are relationships where the woman wears the \"pants\" in the relationship. There is nothing wrong with that as long as both partners are truly happy. But, there are also many relationship mismatches, where women end up confused, and frustrated with their partner, because he doesn't know how to take charge.\n\nNo one said anything about possession. You are adding things simply to speak to your talking point. Compromise and admitting you are wrong is an emotional intelligence issue, which is very important in all relationship dynamics, not just men with women. My point was about respect. Generally speaking, a woman who doesn't respect a man, can't love him. And generally speaking, a man who isn't able to meet a womans emotional needs, won't satisfy her. Generally speaking, men need to feel respected, and women need to have their emotions tended to, for both to feel good in the relationship. My point was, that in most cases, when the relationship is out of wack, or having lots of issues, it's because those rules are being broken.\n\nA second time you add things to the conversation to nicely conclude your talking point. I never said all women are the same. And again, you follow that with an insult about being abusive, or insecure. You conclude my insecurity, but only one of us is insulting the other.\n\nYou don't know why your partner is with you? Maybe you should ask him. For myself, I make the habit of 1. never insulting my partner 2. Never taking them for granted 3. Telling them all the qualities I love about them. 4.

Let me try re-phrasing: If YOU get emotional in a discussion, then that is a signal that YOU have some uncomfortable truths to confront.

Look up the TED talk on the history of spaghetti sauce which shows that by providing a multitude of options in a product improves a persons overall happiness with the product. Then look up the TED talk on \"the perfect pair of pants\", in which the presenters study shows that the multitude of options provided in the pants industry LOWERS a persons overall satisfaction because they felt the onus of making a \"poor decision\" if they didn't like the pants to be a reflection of their own poor decision making.

Women who want to be more subservient to a man in a sense and be more of the stay at home mom and the one who cooks and takes care of the kids is seen as looked down among society. No life style is worse or better but they do get attacked. This is exactly why the amount of women claiming to be feminists has been decreasing rapidly among the years. \n\nFeminism has gotten people fired for normal comments, feminism essentially tends to dismiss regular issues men face( yes prison rape is actually an important issue, you can't just dismiss it because they are in prison I don't know why you'd dismiss people who are in prison.) they regularly attack people who don't claim to agree with people on certain viewpoints. \n\nLook at this convo even.

I remember my dad told me when I was younger (I was mid 30s when this happened) about a friend of his that wanted to work in a suicide hotline to help other. That friend thought it was a \"sign here and start answering calls there\" but actually he had to go to a long training and in the training all he had to do was to say \"Ok\", \"alright\" and \"I understand\". That is it. He had to be trained to fight any other instinct to say anything else. \nMonths after the training and many calls answered, that friend came to my dad and said how he was mesmerized by the fact that people would call back saying \"you saved my life. You told me exactly what to do and I did it and I turned my life around\" - when actually all they always say is \"ok\", \"alright\" and \"I understand\".\nBack to the main story - so after leaving the place I had to come back a few times to sort out finances, pick my things, etc, and the only thing I did was exactly that.\nI just sit there with a sad face, with a very low and calm voice kept repeating those three words.\nEvery time I went there she talked for HOURS explaining why she did, why she wouldn't do it again, how hard her life is, everything from A-to-Z she said and tried - and all I said was those three things and \"We won't get back\".\nFast forward to today. Everyone in her life and family knows she is worthless, mutual friends cut relation with her, she avoids all the places I frequent, and every time the story comes up they just say the nicest things about me - how I could have destroyed her - even release the videos on the internet or have told everyone about it - but that I just did \"the right thing\". \nI remember in the last day we talked she cried a lot and said \"because of what happened and what you did, now I know how good you are, and how I just tossed it away and that makes me feel even worse\".\nLast month or so my dad had to go to her work place to talk to another person there and they sat together in the waiting room. He told me that she was completely out of place, couldn't look him in the eye or say anything the whole time.\n\nBonus fact: a few weeks ago someone told me she was dating a married guy that now he left his wife and they're leaving together.\n\nSo yeah.

Hardcore stuff.\n\nSo yeah. I wanted to explode. I went to a roller coaster of emotions that today still is hard to describe. I wanted to yell at her so many thing. I wanted to make her cry. I wanted her to feel like garbage but in the heat of the moment I just left the apartment we had so I could actually think instead of just feeling disgusted by everything I touched there.\nWhen I started thinking \"a random\" thought crossed my mind. I remember my dad told me when I was younger (I was mid 30s when this happened) about a friend of his that wanted to work in a suicide hotline to help other. That friend thought it was a \"sign here and start answering calls there\" but actually he had to go to a long training and in the training all he had to do was to say \"Ok\", \"alright\" and \"I understand\". That is it. He had to be trained to fight any other instinct to say anything else. \nMonths after the training and many calls answered, that friend came to my dad and said how he was mesmerized by the fact that people would call back saying \"you saved my life. You told me exactly what to do and I did it and I turned my life around\" - when actually all they always say is \"ok\", \"alright\" and \"I understand\".\nBack to the main story - so after leaving the place I had to come back a few times to sort out finances, pick my things, etc, and the only thing I did was exactly that.\nI just sit there with a sad face, with a very low and calm voice kept repeating those three words.\nEvery time I went there she talked for HOURS explaining why she did, why she wouldn't do it again, how hard her life is, everything from A-to-Z she said and tried - and all I said was those three things and \"We won't get back\".\nFast forward to today. Everyone in her life and family knows she is worthless, mutual friends cut relation with her, she avoids all the places I frequent, and every time the story comes up they just say the nicest things about me - how I could have destroyed her - even release the videos on the internet or have told everyone about it - but that I just did \"the right thing\". \nI remember in the last day we talked she cried a lot and said \"because of what happened and what you did, now I know how good you are, and how I just tossed it away and that makes me feel even worse\".\nLast month or so my dad had to go to her work place to talk to another person there and they sat together in the waiting room. He told me that she was completely out of place, couldn't look him in the eye or say anything the whole time.\n\nBonus fact: a few weeks ago someone told me she was dating a married guy that now he left his wife and they're leaving together.\n\nSo yeah. Be 100% nice. Be \"that's impossible nice\". Don't destroy your inner peace because of others.\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for their comments. I'm very thankful to Reddit in general.

I learned this myself when a girlfriend I truly loved started dating someone else. Even though it was via the natural course of not being compatible - it still hurt a lot. I took the course you did, say only what I needed, and tried to let it all go.\n\nBut I found another very powerful step after this one as well. I had to forgive. In my case, it was forgive myself and not lose all manner of peace from wondering 'what if'. You might want to see if you have/need to forgive her or yourself for the hurt she caused you and results.\n\nI don't mean you have to confront her and say 'You are forgiven' (though that works too). No, forgiveness is something that comes from, and is most especially a gift to, your own soul. It is a way to let go and find peace again.  Forgiveness is not a one-time event. We sometimes have to forgive again and again - often for the same hurt - or it can grow and fester in us. If we find ourselves enjoying the fact the other person is hurting because we took the 'high' road - then this is a big sign. Forgiveness is how we find inner freedom. \n\nWe often think of freedom as doing whatever we want. That's not entirely true. In reality, we often are unable to move on with parts of our life, to go certain places, see certain things, relate with certain people, because there is a memory, hurt, or pain that causes us to avoid it.  Sometimes it means we take joy in continuing to hurt or enjoy seeing another who hurt us in pain. This is all lack of freedom because you can't move on and away from it. Freedom is when our past injuries no longer define who we are - and we can flower into the persons we were meant to be.\n", "id": "d3icdnt"}, {"comment": "I will never forget this story", "id": "d3i5f6u"}, {"comment": "I understand", "id": "d3iakc7"}, {"comment": "Ok", "id": "d3ibzd0"}, {"comment": "Alright", "id": "d3icv9i"}, {"comment": "We won't get back.", "id": "d3id2bx"}, {"comment": "I can't believe you've done this.", "id": "d3iimed"}, {"comment": "Here come dat boi", "id": "d3islfh"}, {"comment": "Ssshh", "id": "d3id45t"}, {"comment": "Ayyy", "id": "d3idlry"}, {"comment": "Macarena!", "id": "d3ifv4z"}, {"comment": "great story.

Just imagine that, the person you love is suffering so much pain, and you are the one who is helping her.  I felt like I was selling her crack.  I wasn't!\n\nSo my obvious next smart decision was to start having sex with a therapist. Obviously a doomed relationship, smoking bod and big titties on a skinny chick.  But we were good for each other at the time.  I was like her pet project.  I needed comfort.   \n\nWe break up because it was the logical thing to do.  Two months later, she tells me they found a lump in her immaculate breasts.  And she was the one taking care of her mother and brother, and her friends were all assholes.  \n\nSo, I just told her we would temporarily cancel our break up, and I would be by her side and go to any doctors appointmet, and do her shopping, and do anything she needs until she is healthy enough to break up with me again.   \n\nWe ended up doing that twice for breast cancer.  \n\n\nI think that relationship taught me the true meaning of love.  \n\nMy wife and I have been together for 5 years now.

You are completely selfless.\"\n\nI simply answered, \"I figured you would at least be a little pissed off at me for the last time I broke up with you.\"\n\nPatches aren't fixes.

It should not matter to a customer whether there's a large party at the next table, or whether the folks in the kitchen are slacking off, or whether the delivery truck is impounded, or whether the flight is delayed because of the ground crew. All a customer sees is that they have a representative of the establishment. It sucks to be that representative in that moment-of-truth (which is a legit concept in retail marketing), sure, but that's how retail businesses work.\n\n2. \"Busy times of the day\": Yeah, if an establishment is unable to scale up to demand, they should not offer service in such windows to the \"late customers\". Service is offered with an implication of a pleasant experience and if the establishment is unable to provide this experience - it's better to push the customer away beforehand than leave the customer fuming. Having said that, I've personally never held the establishment responsible at such times.\n\n3. \"The tone matters\": Yes. Of course it does.

It should not matter to a customer whether there's a large party at the next table, or whether the folks in the kitchen are slacking off, or whether the delivery truck is impounded, or whether the flight is delayed because of the ground crew. All a customer sees is that they have a representative of the establishment. It sucks to be that representative in that moment-of-truth (which is a legit concept in retail marketing), sure, but that's how retail businesses work.\n\n2. \"Busy times of the day\": Yeah, if an establishment is unable to scale up to demand, they should not offer service in such windows to the \"late customers\". Service is offered with an implication of a pleasant experience and if the establishment is unable to provide this experience - it's better to push the customer away beforehand than leave the customer fuming. Having said that, I've personally never held the establishment responsible at such times.\n\n3. \"The tone matters\": Yes. Of course it does.

But where else would people of power get together \u2013 on park benches or carousels? Indeed, they meet in rooms: corporate boardrooms, Pentagon command rooms, at the Bohemian Grove, in the choice dining rooms at the best restaurants, resorts, hotels, and estates, in the many conference rooms at the White House, the NSA, the CIA, or wherever. And, yes, they consciously plot \u2013 though they call it \u201cplanning\u201d and \u201cstrategizing\u201d \u2013 and they do so in great secrecy, often resisting all efforts at public disclosure. No one confabulates and plans more than political and corporate elites and their hired specialists. To make the world safe for those who own it, politically active elements of the owning class have created a national security state that expends billions of dollars and enlists the efforts of vast numbers of people.\u201d \n\n>Yet there are individuals who ask with patronizing, incredulous smiles, do you really think that the people at the top have secret agendas, are aware of their larger interests, and talk to each other about them? To which I respond, why would they not? This is not to say that every corporate and political elite is actively dedicated to working for the higher circles of power and property. Nor are they infallible or always correct in their assessments and tactics or always immediately aware of how their interests are being affected by new situations. But they are more attuned and more capable of advancing their vast interests than most other social groups.\n\n>The alternative is to believe that the powerful and the privileged are somnambulists, who move about oblivious to questions of power and privilege; that they always tell us the truth and have nothing to hide even when they hide so much; that although most of us ordinary people might consciously try to pursue our own interests, wealthy elites do not; that when those at the top employ force and violence around the world it is only for the laudable reasons they profess; that when they arm, train, and finance covert actions in numerous countries, and then fail to acknowledge their role in such deeds, it is because of oversight or forgetfulness or perhaps modesty; and that it is merely a coincidence how the policies of the national security state so consistently serve the interests of the transnational corporations and the capital-accumulation system throughout the world."], [0, "don't bother their probably right."], [1, "\"Never argue with an idiot.

You can give them easy demonstrations like 'why doesn't your steel pot melt on a natural gas range, when kerosene burns at a much lower temperature than natural gas' and they stare at you blankly.\n\nIn other words, I find that the fundamental aspect that is universal among anti-conspiracy theorists is authoritarianism and the remarkable ability to accept ideas given to them without thinking; and as another wrinkle to that, that they either lack the ability of, or outright refuse to engage within the activity of critical thinking.  There's something about their psychology that inhibits it.  It's a scary territory--to think for yourself.  Usually because culture reinforces this unquestioning behavior.\n\nI'll give you a perfect example.  People think that steel trusses will melt if you hold a flame on them, in the same way that a candle will melt.  The problem is that this ignores a fundamental property of steel which is that it's a good conductor of heat.  Any heat you throw on it will disperse, not accumulate.  This is one reason that the WTC steel did not melt due to the kerosene or office furniture, unless you want to suspend the 2nd law of thermodynamics. To weaken those trusses causing any kind of collapse, there would need to be far more heat than is possible.\n\nHere's another experiment.  Go outside and make a bonfire with a bunch of wood.

Take for instance the topic of source material... It is fair to say that a lot of people who live in the modernized western countries of Europe and in Canada and certainly in the U.S. and South America (with special regard to Brazil) have heard many, many times that the media is extremely consolidated. There are at least a few compilations on YouTube showing television affiliate stations from across the United States repeating, verbatim the very same stories over and over again. While that could be pretty efficient, it is probably not the way journalism should be done because you run the risk of everyone getting the story wrong and repeating it. Now, the population at large has been misinformed.\n\n The sources from which major news stories are written, are often deemed trustworthy or reliable without cross examination by the people consuming the news. The big lights and expensive sets, the suspenseful music and polished people construct the illusion of information authority.  The superficial nature and sensationalism of Mainstream news doesn't promote investigation into topics that matter. There are vast black holes of pertinent information not discussed or completely stifled by the major news corporation. Actual fact checking takes exhaustive investigation and cross referencing. You can't dismiss something outright because you read it on a WordPress blog instead of seeing it on some major \"news\" program.\n\nThe fact is, There are uncountable instances of actual conspiracies having taken place.

The requirement of calculation, expertise, coordination, secrecy, compartmentalization and ruthlessness do not exclude the possibility of a conspiracy a priori, however - smart, experienced, well-connected and ruthless people have historically, often, repeatedly, conspired to achieve a common goal and maintained secrecy for their own sakes.

The dark figure is, without doubt, much greater, as is the number of cases where the evidence did not suffice for a lawful conviction although the suspects were guilty a.f. (for example, they convicted Al Capone for tax fraud, IIRC, not for the crimes he really was responsble for - that's how good his conspiracies were).

Indeed, they meet in rooms: corporate boardrooms, Pentagon command rooms, at the Bohemian Grove, in the choice dining rooms at the best restaurants, resorts, hotels, and estates, in the many conference rooms at the White House, the NSA, the CIA, or wherever.

It is the owner's responsibility to keep their dogs away from people !"], [16, "Ok, so some people in this thread seem to have trouble understanding why I can't just train my dog not to jump on someone before it even happens. \n\nHere's the thing, when you train a dog, you are doing one of two things; you are either adding a new behavior, or you are breaking an existing behavior. \n\nFor instance, I taught my dog to \"touch.\" This is a behavior in which I prompt the dog by holding out the palm of my hand and telling my dog \"touch.\" My dog will then do whatever she has to do in order to touch her nose to the palm of my hand. This type of training is adding a behavior and very easy to accomplish. Once the behavior is completed, you can praise the dog for doing what you asked and they have no problem associating behavior->treat.\n\nBreaking a behavior is quite a bit harder. When you praise a dog, they understand it to mean \"that thing I just did must be good so I'll do more of it.\" However, it's harder to reward a dog for *not* doing something. The concept of *not* doing something is very abstract to a dog, especially when it's something the dog very much loves to do. \n\nTo train a dog not to jump, you can't simply say \"don't jump!\" The dog has no clue what that means. Nor can you simply show them what to do as you would by teaching the dog to sit or down. The best way to train a dog not to jump is by not encouraging the behavior. The best way to not encourage a dog to jump is to turn your back to the dog and ignore it until the dog calms down. You will need to turn your back to them several times before they get the idea. Once they calm down and they keep \"four on the floor,\" then you give the dog praise and affection. \n\nThe really hard part with training a dog is that you have to generalize the dog's behavior. For instance, my dog know's that when I tell her \"touch\" when we're at home, she is to perform the command. However, if I never reinforce the \"touch\" command in any other settings, she won't listen. She needs to generalize the behavior, or in essence, she needs to know that no matter what the situation, when I say touch, she is to touch.\n\nGetting a dog to generalize not jumping is very difficult. My dog knows not to jump on me because that's how I taught her to behave around me. However, my dog needs to be taught that is how she is to act around everyone. She needs to generalize the behavior. I can't do that all by myself. I need everyone  that comes in contact with my dog to help me by discouraging the behavior.\n\nThis is why OP made his post. OP's dog surely doesn't jump on OP, but OP needs to generalize the behavior and teach his dog that it's not okay to jump on anybody else. However, when you go up to OP's dog (or anybody's dog), and OP tells you don't let the dog jump on you and you let the dog jump on you anyway, you are teaching the dog that it doesn't have to generalize that behavior. You are teaching the dog that it's okay to jump on everyone but OP. \n\nAnd this is why it is so difficult and frustrating when you are training a dog to not jump on anyone. It's not that OP isn't trying. Trust me, he is. It's that OP needs your help, otherwise the dog will continue to jump on everyone he meets."], [18, "Or conversely, don't get pissed when I swat at your dog jumping on me. I'm not hitting your dog.

It's great that you love dogs and don't mind when they jump on you, but the next person I walk by may not feel the same way. Some people don't like dogs or are afraid of them. \n\nThe best thing to do when a dog jumps on you (but is not being aggressive) is simply let your arms hang at your sides and ignore the dog.

No matter what the noise, no matter the person ... this dog goes fucking psycho when set off. No just barking either. It legitimately sounds like this dog want to fucking kill anything it sees. As you may have guessed, they have little to no control over this animal. I've seen this thing bust through screen and glass doors like they're not even there.\n\nI've seen this thing enough that I know it won't actually attack me, but it does a very convincing job of growling, getting its back-hair standing up and then running at someone/something right up to the last second where it'll stop and bark like mad.\n\nAnyway ... so one day I'm with them and they decide to take this thing to the local dog park. No matter how much I tried to explain that it was a bad idea, they were hell bent that he would be fine.\n\nAfter awhile this dog finally acclimates to its surroundings and the other dogs and they let it off its leash. The thing immedaitly runs up barking to another couple who were there. They were \"dog people\" so evidently knew the dog wasn't going to attack them but just bark, so they stood there calmly until my friends went over. This literally happens 4 more times with each couple there.\n\nTHings get interesting when this young guy with a puppy comes in the gate. Their dog of course does his full sprint and growl thing, only you can see this new dog owner is terrified of what's about to happen to him and his puppy. So unlike the others owners I see this guy wind up a full-bore soccer kick right at their dogs head. \n\n**POW!**\n\nNow I've never seen a dog get fucked up before, but their dog was down for the count after that blow. The guy literally picks up his puppy and is fleeing the area, other dogs are barking like mad, owners and my friends are running over. It was pandamonium!\n\nAnyway ... fast forward another week or so and I went over to their place. Just walking up to their door I could hear their dog going nuts, only when I actually got to the door their dog was just standing int he kitchen and regular barking (not rabid and scary barking like normal).

I've tried to tame her and it works with me, but because everyone around tends to ignore what I'm saying and takes it upon themselves to handle my dog their way, it fucks shit up severely.

It's annoying. \n\nI've actually become quite pissed with the people around me because they don't listen to a word I say, and instead now have kinda isolated me from chilling with them because I don't want them fucking up my shit. \n\nThis kinda turned into a rant, but I'm new to being a dog owner and trying to find my way.\n\nRight now I live abroad, so this is temporary, as back home she's much different and much easier to train as the people there ask questions and mimic my ways, making the entire thing much more simple. \n"], [3, "Additionally, if a dog barks and freaks out every time you come into the door, completely ignore it, don't even make eye contact until the dog calms down (unless of course a St. Bernard is jumping on you, then I understand) and the dog will eventually learn that he's not gonna get attention until he chills out."], [3, "[DON'T BE A DICK AT YOUR MOMS HOUSE](http://youtu.be/sRGsN3w41F0)"], [3, "This is something I always try to remember.

Before I moved counties I used to walk dogs from a local shelter, just for fun. Quite often they'd been cooped up for a long time and were extremely hyper and jumpy.

We went back to separating them like we were, and corrected both of those behaviors quickly.\n\nAfter getting that dealt with, I was taking her for a walk about a week later, still training her, and this neighbor's chihuahua (who regularly runs around the neighborhood) came charging at us forcing me to grab my dog and hold her behind me.  I'd already put myself between them once I saw them in the neighbor's yard, but that's not going to completely stop my dog from reacting. The guy's response was to tell me to kick his dog to get him to back off.  Thankfully the dog's all bark and no bite, so he charged until he was a few feet away, then backed off, allowing me to correct my own dog and continue the walk.

It's a two way street :/", "id": "czcgxot"}], [{"comment": "Ok, so some people in this thread seem to have trouble understanding why I can't just train my dog not to jump on someone before it even happens. \n\nHere's the thing, when you train a dog, you are doing one of two things; you are either adding a new behavior, or you are breaking an existing behavior. \n\nFor instance, I taught my dog to \"touch.\" This is a behavior in which I prompt the dog by holding out the palm of my hand and telling my dog \"touch.\" My dog will then do whatever she has to do in order to touch her nose to the palm of my hand. This type of training is adding a behavior and very easy to accomplish. Once the behavior is completed, you can praise the dog for doing what you asked and they have no problem associating behavior->treat.\n\nBreaking a behavior is quite a bit harder. When you praise a dog, they understand it to mean \"that thing I just did must be good so I'll do more of it.\" However, it's harder to reward a dog for *not* doing something. The concept of *not* doing something is very abstract to a dog, especially when it's something the dog very much loves to do. \n\nTo train a dog not to jump, you can't simply say \"don't jump!\" The dog has no clue what that means. Nor can you simply show them what to do as you would by teaching the dog to sit or down. The best way to train a dog not to jump is by not encouraging the behavior. The best way to not encourage a dog to jump is to turn your back to the dog and ignore it until the dog calms down. You will need to turn your back to them several times before they get the idea. Once they calm down and they keep \"four on the floor,\" then you give the dog praise and affection. \n\nThe really hard part with training a dog is that you have to generalize the dog's behavior. For instance, my dog know's that when I tell her \"touch\" when we're at home, she is to perform the command. However, if I never reinforce the \"touch\" command in any other settings, she won't listen. She needs to generalize the behavior, or in essence, she needs to know that no matter what the situation, when I say touch, she is to touch.\n\nGetting a dog to generalize not jumping is very difficult. My dog knows not to jump on me because that's how I taught her to behave around me. However, my dog needs to be taught that is how she is to act around everyone. She needs to generalize the behavior. I can't do that all by myself. I need everyone  that comes in contact with my dog to help me by discouraging the behavior.\n\nThis is why OP made his post. OP's dog surely doesn't jump on OP, but OP needs to generalize the behavior and teach his dog that it's not okay to jump on anybody else. However, when you go up to OP's dog (or anybody's dog), and OP tells you don't let the dog jump on you and you let the dog jump on you anyway, you are teaching the dog that it doesn't have to generalize that behavior. You are teaching the dog that it's okay to jump on everyone but OP. \n\nAnd this is why it is so difficult and frustrating when you are training a dog to not jump on anyone. It's not that OP isn't trying. Trust me, he is. It's that OP needs your help, otherwise the dog will continue to jump on everyone he meets.", "id": "czckzaf"}], [{"comment": "Or conversely, don't get pissed when I swat at your dog jumping on me.

Some people don't like dogs or are afraid of them. \n\nThe best thing to do when a dog jumps on you (but is not being aggressive) is simply let your arms hang at your sides and ignore the dog.

No matter what the noise, no matter the person ... this dog goes fucking psycho when set off. No just barking either. It legitimately sounds like this dog want to fucking kill anything it sees. As you may have guessed, they have little to no control over this animal. I've seen this thing bust through screen and glass doors like they're not even there.\n\nI've seen this thing enough that I know it won't actually attack me, but it does a very convincing job of growling, getting its back-hair standing up and then running at someone/something right up to the last second where it'll stop and bark like mad.\n\nAnyway ... so one day I'm with them and they decide to take this thing to the local dog park. No matter how much I tried to explain that it was a bad idea, they were hell bent that he would be fine.\n\nAfter awhile this dog finally acclimates to its surroundings and the other dogs and they let it off its leash. The thing immedaitly runs up barking to another couple who were there. They were \"dog people\" so evidently knew the dog wasn't going to attack them but just bark, so they stood there calmly until my friends went over. This literally happens 4 more times with each couple there.\n\nTHings get interesting when this young guy with a puppy comes in the gate. Their dog of course does his full sprint and growl thing, only you can see this new dog owner is terrified of what's about to happen to him and his puppy. So unlike the others owners I see this guy wind up a full-bore soccer kick right at their dogs head. \n\n**POW!**\n\nNow I've never seen a dog get fucked up before, but their dog was down for the count after that blow. The guy literally picks up his puppy and is fleeing the area, other dogs are barking like mad, owners and my friends are running over. It was pandamonium!\n\nAnyway ... fast forward another week or so and I went over to their place. Just walking up to their door I could hear their dog going nuts, only when I actually got to the door their dog was just standing int he kitchen and regular barking (not rabid and scary barking like normal).

Mostly people won't like you stopping them because it gives a feeling of taking sides with the other person. Their hands are free therefore they can do whatever they want. Plus they can get out of that position easily if they really want to because it's the force of all their body against only your arms.\n**C**: your hands are low when you pull them from the waist.

Here's an example:\n\n**MAN 1:** I am experiencing an emotion.    \n**MAN 2:** What is the cause of this emotion?    \n**MAN 1:** The cause is a problem that I am having.    \n**MAN 2:** Perhaps you should solve the problem.    \n**MAN 1:** I lack a method by which to solve the problem.    \n**MAN 2:** I shall lend my assistance in devising a solution.\n\nOn the opposite side of the gender fence, we have this:\n\n**WOMAN 1:** I am experiencing an emotion.    \n**WOMAN 2:** Please describe the complexity of this emotion.    \n**WOMAN 1:** The emotion is very complex.    \n**WOMAN 2:** I can sympathize with that emotion, and with its complexity.    \n**WOMAN 1:** I appreciate your sympathy, and would value a chance to further explore this emotion.    \n**WOMAN 2:** I shall acquire spelunking gear, that we might probe its very depths.\n\nIn short, men tend to be solution-driven. We're just as emotional and sensitive, but we're often more focused on the cause of our emotions rather than the emotions themselves.

Following that, some men become irritated when it *seems* like they're being presented with a problem to fix, but all their female partners really want is someone to listen and understand.\n\nA good way of remedying this would be as follows:\n\n**WOMAN:** I am experiencing an emotion.    \n**MAN:** What is the cause of this emotion?    \n**WOMAN:** The cause is a problem that I am having.    \n**MAN:** Perhaps you should solve the problem.    \n**WOMAN:** I appreciate that advice, and I would value a chance to further explore this emotion.    \n**MAN:** System error.    \n**WOMAN:** I do not require a solution; I only request support and understanding.    \n**MAN:** My support is freely given, as is my affection.    \n**WOMAN:** Thank you.

Going to the doctor and getting a cast will ultimately solve this temporary problem, but it doesn't make it any less inconvenient or painful. \n\nSome times when people offer fixes to problems, the answers are presented in a way that seems to imply the problem-haver was unable to think of any solution themselves. Perhaps, if your instinct is to offer advice, ask first how the person you're speaking to intends to deal with the issue at hand. If they want help, this is the point where they would reply that they lack a solution and ask for your opinion. If they just want to vent, they'll either tell you want they plan to do or they'll say they don't know *then continue to complain*. \n\nIn these cases, all they want is validation, and that's okay. Sometimes asking how they plan to handle a situation (not exactly what they'll do, but how they'll do it) can serve the additional purpose of redirecting their thoughts to a place that reminds them they have agency in their lives and are not just helpless participants.

Just shut up and listen to what someone has to say and let them finish.  \n2. Acknowledge that their problems are real (if they genuinely are, I mean) even if yours may be more serious, and say you're sorry this is happening to them.  \n3. Let a solid second pass before you start sharing your own story. It could be a similar experience with the same level of severity, or something different and far more serious. The person I mentioned before can't wait for me to finish talking so that they can dive into their own story, which makes me wonder if they even paid attention to what I was saying or if they were just sitting there recalling their own experience and waiting for their turn to speak.  \n4.

This is just some First World Problems level nonsense.\n\nThe level of treatment of animals in factory farms is on par with the level of treatment of humans during most genocides, including but not limited to the Holocaust.\n\nThe number of (just) land animals killed for food *each year* is over 50 billion, the vast majority of whom are killed in factory farms. That greatly exceeds all human genocides put together.\n\nUnless humans are worth orders of magnitude more than animals (which I think is highly unlikely, I don't think my life is more important than my dog's by a factor of 1000, which is what it would need to be), then the level of treatment and size of the meat industry exceeds all human genocides put together in its unethical magnitude. Notice I don't even think animals are as important as humans, just that if they are even remotely important, this is worse than every genocide put together.\n\nYou cannot argue with those numbers.\n\nYou can argue with my claims.\n\nIf you believe the treatment of animals is much better than how Jews were treated in the Holocaust, for example, I'd encourage you to explain why.\n\nIf you believe the life of one human is more important than the life of 1000 pigs, I'd encourage you to explain why.\n\n>I really doubt that.\n\nOkay, you're right.

Theirs will not be.. unless we help.", "id": "czn36mm"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "czn3p9b"}, {"comment": ">Stripped of clothing and all earthly possessions, heads shaved, forced to hide things in unmentionable places, starved and experimented on. Got it.\n\nAnimals are experimented on in places entirely separate from the meat industry.\n\nIn the meat industry, they are routinely forced to endure various procedures without anesthesia, such as debeaking, dehorning, tail docking, castration, etc. I think this meets the same criteria of harm as shaving ones' head or experimenting on one.\n\nDairy cows are forcibly inseminated while being held in place many times throughout their life, which I think counts as being coerced into putting something obtrusive in a place you don't want to. And yes, dairy cows feel shitty about being forcibly inseminated.\n\nObviously you can't strip them of clothing, but if we say for humans, clothing provides warmth, protection from the elements, sanitary protection from open infected wounds, the crowded conditions of factory farms deny animals those basic privileges. The conditions of transportation trucks expose animals to severely overcrowded conditions where they cannot breathe, and often freeze to death or die of heat exhaustion depending on the weather.\n\nSide note: the Nazis modeled their transportation of the victims of the Holocaust after the slaughterhouse industry, and you can look that up if you don't believe me.\n\n>I wasn't. I was arguing with the Nazi comparison.\n\nOkay.\n\n>Easy. A human of Judaism faith is a lot more complex than an animal in terms of the ability to experience emotion and suffering. Not to mention the Holocaust was organised to exterminate a certain group of people while robbing them of all humanity.\n\nWell, I think instantiating \"robbing them of humanity\" is sort of begging the question, since whether humans matter so much more than farm animals is exactly what's being called into question.\n\nBut with regard to the other things you said, humans are more complex in some ways. But animals are more complex in other ways.\n\nFor example, humans feel terror and horror losing their children. It's extremely traumatic. Yet, our best physiological explanation for this phenomena uses parts of our physiology which mammals have too, and numerically cows have more of (I'm talking about the hormones which bond mother to child).\n\nIn fact, our scientific understanding of human pain and suffering has taught us beyond any reasonable doubt that animals share our psychological profile there.\n\nFinally, even if a human is more complex, and factors like being able to contemplate ones' suffering or something actually makes them suffer more, I'm open to that idea. But this changes things by a factor of 1000? I'm doubtful. And even if it is a factor of 1000, well, I guess congratulations for proving it's not literally worse than every genocide ever put together, guess it's just kind of as bad as one genocide. Maybe we should still stop?\n\nSince you specifically noted extermination, let me point out that while that is a really fucking bad thing, isn't it worse to exterminate millions in horrendous conditions but then to continue making more of them? The extermination just never ends. As Isaac Beshevis Singer said (another Holocaust survivor), our treatment of animals is \"an eternal Treblinka\".\n\nAlso, I want to call to attention the fact that you have completely ignored the non-Jewish victims of the Holocaust. There are millions.\n\n>I really doubt that. How do you think we should handle wild/feral animal overpopulation? Do you think it's possible to humanely kill animals?\n\nThese are two separate questions.\n\nQuestion 1: I'm not going to answer here because this is a rabbit hole. Philosopher [Jeff McMahan](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=wild+animal+suffering+jeff+mcmahan) comes close to my views in the linked article, if you care. More importantly, regardless of whether wild animal suffering matters, I think we still have an obligation to not cause *more* suffering in the way that we are.\n\nQuestion 2: No, because killing a being which enjoys its life is inhumane. Animals in the meat industry probably have lives that are not worth living, so its a mercy to kill them. But making more of them is making more creatures which are suffering more than they are having valuable lives, so we should really stop the meat industry with this current generation of farmed animals.\n\nA different, more interesting question is \"Can you kill an animal without suffering?\". The answer is yes, but it's not practical in any economic setting. It also requires you to be sensitive to the social needs of animals, which means we can only kill solitary animals.\n\n>Are there shitty farms? Yes. Are they all shitty? No. Now, these shitty farms you reference... I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that the damning evidence is limited to specific farms, yes? That violate the Humane Slaughter Act, yes?\n\nI'm sorry, but if you don't realize that the 99% of farmed animals that die in factory farms face similar conditions, you are ignoring reality. Every time a new company comes out with a flashy new look, advertising \"humane meat\", someone gets in there with a camera and shows us what we shouldn't find surprising: you can't kill thousands of animals per day for profit in a small area without fucking torturing them.\n\nIf you want some evidence, google some of the things I brought up like \"tail docking\" and \"gestation crates\". You can find organizations of pig farmers prescribing this as a policy at conferences. They aren't hiding the fact that this is the industry standard.\n\n>So it would be fair to say this \"damning\" evidence is no more than damning than witnessing some videos of police brutality and condemning all police. Or footage of some schools abusing children and condemning the entire education system.\n\nIf you do your research, you'll find that factory farms (by their nature) need to greatly cut corners and harm a lot of animals to do their work.\n\nSo-called \"humane meat\" comprises an astronomically small percentage of the market, and you can look that up (it's a fact).\n\nHere's a simple thought experiment. You want to have an egg farm and meet the enormous demand for eggs. But you can't prevent male chicks from being born. So you hatch a few hundred chicks a day, but of course a few hundred of those will be male. Are you going to nearly double the prices of your eggs? Are you going to keep thousands of roosters as pets? No, of course not. You're going to do what 99% of the hatchery market in America does, which is mass-kill male chicks in the quickest and most efficient manner possible, either by grinding them up or by suffocating them in a large bag (which happens to be extremely painful).", "id": "czn8ica"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "czndzxk"}, {"comment": ">Meaning that this complaint has nothing to do with the meat industry or the use of animals for food.\n\nGranted, I just wanted to point out quickly that it's funny you brought up experiments, since that is another use of animals vegans object to and a very literal connection with the Holocaust.\n\n>Tail docking is a hygiene measure. Momentary pain to prevent prolonged illness.\n\nYou know, people who keep pigs as pets don't need to have their tails cut off. This \"hygiene measure\" you speak of, along with \"ear clipping\" is intended to prevent the pigs from literally cannibalizing each other, which is what they tend to do under their stressful conditions. It may be better for pigs to be tail docked than not to be tail docked (given their circumstances), but I'm calling into question those circumstances themselves.\n\nIt's like Frank is keeping slaves in his basement, and because of the fact that they are so stressed out, they have started scratching the walls and breaking their nails. So Frank gets out some plyers and rips off all of their nails, ending the matter once and for all. And then you come along to explain why this is a hygiene measure, conveniently ignoring the obvious question of why the hell we need to keep slaves in a basement in the first place such that we need to rip their nails off.\n\n>Regardless, this is all performed on young. If you have a problem with this, then I would like to remind you of the human version; Circumcision.\n\nWho says I don't have an issue with circumcision? I do. I would have even more of an issue with circumcision if it was needed because we were raising male children in factory farm-like conditions.\n\n>On some dairy farms.\n\nDairy farms are not keeping useless males around just so the dairy cows can happily impregnate themselves when they want to. That's way too expensive.\n\nYou don't get $3 milk treating cows that nicely.\n\n>They feel shitty about being forcibly mounted by a bull too. If you want to pioneer first wave feminism for cows, good luck.\n\nYes, animals rape each other and it sucks. Doesn't mean we get to rape them too.\n\nIt's like you get on a plane to a country with a really high degree of rape, and find some woman whose been gang raped a few times and have a go, because hey, it felt bad when the others did it too, so why not you as well??? See the issue?\n\n>It's starting to become apparent to me that your idea of what a factory farm is may actually be a sorting and processing slaughterhouse. Those animals are held maybe 24 hours after being transported from farms that, instead of being owned by factories, are family operated.\n\nI know most farms do not raise through the slaughter. Most large feedlots do comprise the majority of cows that are raised, and even if they are \"family-owned\", I'm concerned with the conditions of the animals, which is independent of how much of a fun family guy the owner is. Most plantations were family-owned, right?\n\nAnd I've seen what CAFO's are like, and they raise the majority of our beef, and what hatcheries are like, and what egg-laying operations are like, and the list goes on. I don't have time for your pedantic distinctions, and neither do the animals who are being tortured every minute for your precious tastes.\n\n>Every cow that dies represents around $1,000 loss, considering the amount the farmer receives, which on a good year can be $1.20/lb (times that by an 800lb cow/steer). Then there is the profit they get from selling each steak. Ignoring for a moment that it would be unprofitable to have cattle die in transport, you can tell how stressed a cow or other animal was by looking at packaged meat.\n\nI'm reminded of the often-repeated pro-slavery argument, even today, \"How could the slavemasters have frequently and repeatedly whipped their slaves mercilessly? They paid thousands of dollars for each slave, and their slaves being in healthy condition is how they make money, so it doesn't make sense for them to have done it.\"\n\nAnd yet we know they did it, from lots of empirical evidence. So the lesson here is that humans do not always behave rationally, especially when they are systematically objectifying and denying the moral status of another.\n\nAnd I'd wager it's more expensive to provide heated or air-conditioned slaughterhouse trucks with ample room and nice happy fun time then it is to just deal with some \"spillage\" (DOA animals).\n\nInterestingly, you have not questioned my point that the trucks are obscenely crowded, and not temperature-regulated, so even if the animals don't die, yippee for them while they freeze or suffer from heat exhaustion.\n\n>And yet here we are, still microchipping dogs, assigning identification numbers and forcibly castrating them. Can you see the Holocaust comparison? Anything can be reduced to relate to anything else.\n\nYes, but my comparison to the Holocaust is precisely about the suffering it inflicted. It's not about anything else pertaining to the Holocaust.\n\nWhat makes something bad is lots of suffering, which the Holocaust had, and which the meat industry has even more of.\n\nIncidentally, the pet industry has lots of that too, and I don't think most people should be trusted to keep pets in a healthy and humane manner. I don't see how any of this has any weight on whether we ought to eat meat or not, however.\n\n>They do. The easiest example of this is putting a dog down just because it wasn't adopted. Could you imagine that process being used on orphaned children?\n\nNo, but that's because people don't want orphaned children to be living in tiny cages and crowded by the thousands, so they pay enough for shelters for them to have okay lives growing up. If people cared as little about orphaned children as they do about animals, and also domestic animals didn't reproduce like all the fucking time for no good reason, I'd absolutely not be in favor of euthanasia.\n\n>I can't remember the study, but IIRC cows are more inclined to form less permanent emotional attachments to young. This allows them to to continue producing young without forming debilitating attachments to those lost to predators. Meaning less of an emotional connection.\n\nI'm not an expert on cow consciousness, so I'll just concede this point instead of doing the research. Fact is, you still haven't explained why humans are worth a thousand times what an animal is worth.\n\n>In terms of senses and instinctual intelligence, sure. Complex math, written language and the ability to learn other languages however? I mean I'm all for the the David Brin concept of Uplifting animals to a Neo-state, but be real.\n\nYou know, I'm a math student, and my sister is pretty terrible at math. And I don't think this makes me more deserving of good treatment than her. In fact, if someone wanted to kill her and eat her because she sucks at math, I'd have a pretty serious objection.\n\nMy point is that intelligence is nice in the human world, but nobody thinks more intelligent people just get to run all over less intelligent people whenever they want. Except for literal Nazis. Which you are?\n\n>Similar pain transmitters does not equal similar psychological responses.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20131109230457/http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf\n\n>A thought experiment then; Would you kill one animal to save a thousand humans? What about a thousand human infants? Would you kill a thousand animals to save one human? Would you kill a thousand animals to save one human infant?\nExtension; Would you kill a thousand animals to save your infant?\n\nRespectively, yes, yes, no, no, and no. I mean *maybe* I would put so much weight on my own infant to do that, but that doesn't mean it'd be morally okay. Just that people are very selfishly infatuated with their own crotchfruit, to the extent that they deny the moral value of anyone else. And honestly, I only say maybe because I haven't experienced the biological wonder of parenthood. I honestly don't believe my views about saving the many over the few would go out the window once I have a kid.\n\n>Do you think the animal considers it as such? Those Jewish individuals involved in the Holocaust consider it a Holocaust, Do you think animals consider it as such? Be real, many of the fences containing livestock could be felled by as little as one animal running into it in an altruistic sacrifice. If the wanted to escape they could do so quite easily\n\nImagine a mentally handicapped person in the Holocaust. They also did not understand what was happening to them very well. It's still wrong to have done it to them.\n\nAnd yes, animals *can* leave, but there are two points to make here:\n\n1) They often do. Animals escape from slaughterhouse trucks and from factory farms all the time.\n\n2) Learned helplessness is a thing, and the fact that animals are really fucking stupid and easy to keep penned up does not say anything about how justified we are in doing so.\n\n>Then I believe you need to have a word with the ASPCA. They kill (or \"put down\") numerous animals purely because people don't want to adopt them.\n\nAs I said, killing can be a mercy. If you want to stress this point, I'll revise my assertion that killing is inhumane with the following assertion: \"Killing a creature which could have a life worth living is inhumane\".\n\n>Could I apply this to a disabled child or an adult human working in a cubicle with several mortgages? Or a child subjected to physical, emotional or sexual abuse?\n\nIt's interesting that you brought up disabled people, since they are the most common counterexample to anti-vegan rhetoric about how smart humans are. Now I know you cannot deny the validity of such a counterexample later on.\n\nNow, to answer your question.\n\nYou *could*, but it'd be wrong most of the time, since most disabled people happen to have lives worth living. In fact, I've heard people with Down's syndrome report greater life satisfaction than able-minded people on average.\n\nContinued:", "id": "cznjjx1"}, {"comment": "Prefer?

[Here he explains why he goes that route in this article from The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/19/television.features1).  \n\n\"There are some actors who come alive in front of a crowd, and if you've cast it right, there's an energy between cast and audience that can be exhilarating for both parties, then enjoyed by the audience at home... Audience laughter, when it's deserved, acts as a sort of fairy dust that makes funny moments not just funny, but joyous.\"\n\nSitcoms get a lot of flack for having audience laughter included nowadays; it is easy to pan the 'laugh track' as unnecessary when there are so many good examples of sitcoms that don't use it.  No one would suggest that a live taping of a stand-up comedian would be better if there wasn't an audience laughing along. Imagine a Shakespeare comedy with the audience removed, or watch a movie adaptation of one of his comedies. I would suggest that the reason they don't work as well as movie versions of the tragedies is because the audience component of the comedies is so much more important.  \n\nIt's hardly difficult to laugh when we are alone, but laughter is ultimately a social response, and that's why comedy works so well in a group setting, and laughing along with your fellow humans, like Linehan says, elevates the funny to the joyous.  It isn't that we need the audience to let us know when to laugh, it's just part of the overall joyous experience.", "id": "d26p6zw"}, {"comment": "Ahahahaha... *dead silence*", "id": "d26lks2"}, {"comment": "#HAAHAHHAAHAHAHAA!!", "id": "d26rkng"}, {"comment": "I never noticed it like 10 years ago.

The assumption was that subconsciously they felt that if they didn't, they weren't adding value.\n\n>The artist working on the queen animations for Battle Chess was aware of this tendency, and came up with an innovative solution. He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck. He animated this duck through all of the queen's animations, had it flapping around the corners. He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the \"actual\" animation.\n\n>Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen. The producer sat down and watched all of the animations. When they were done, he turned to the artist and said, \"That looks great.

He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck. He animated this duck through all of the queen's animations, had it flapping around the corners. He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the \"actual\" animation.\n\n> Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen.

I'll only suggest a full rewrite of a sentence if the meaning is particularly unclear, and I think that reshuffling the ideas would help with the clarity.

If they have questions, or counter-suggestions to take the sentence in a completely different suggestions from either the original or the proposed edit (which is often my strategy when something I've written is being proofread), I'm always open to hear and discuss them. I often don't expect every comment I make to be listened to, but hope that the writer finds them useful somehow.\n\nIf I see a perfect piece of writing that I don't think can be improved for clarity in any way, I am perfectly happy to tell the writer this.

We took down notes and were in charge of admin stuff for a crisis action team.  The head non commissioned officer in charge (NCOIC), a MSgt, didn't like me for some reason.  Despite me never really working with him.  About a year after having this duty, and working it around 10 times, I was called in with 2 others and was tasked with cleaning the room, updating T.O.s (books that tell us how to do things) and restocking the room.  The MSgt wasn't there, instead there was the OIC (a Major.)  He semi hung around while I was put in charge of the other 2 to delegate tasks and get everything done.  We cleaned, I restocked what I could and took a list down of things that couldn't be restocked because we didn't have the supplies.  I even offered to use my own squadron's charge account to buy the supplies.  Something that my squadron probably would have bitched about if I did.  The OIC said no, he'd take care of it.  The only fuck up I did was to not look over the T.O.s after the person I assigned the task to, in order to ensure it was done properly.\n\n3 weeks later there was an exercise.  I wasn't selected to work the CAT that time, which happened from time to time as they rotated  who served a bit.  The exercise went on for a week, which was pretty long for the base to have one, and the CAT met every day of that week.  Which was also unusually long.  \n\nAt the end of that week, I get a pissed off phone call from the NCOIC.  He said the base commander complained that the CAT was dirty **at the end of the week long exercise**.  He bitched at me for not cleaning, which we did pretty thoroughly.  He complained that I didn't restock the markers and other things, which the OIC said he was going to take care of.  He complained the T.O.s weren't done right, which I took the blame for as I didn't look over them after the other person completed the task.  He tried to say I had a poor attitude the entire time I did CAT, which I absolutely did not and many other CAT workers backed me up on.  Lastly he tried to say I had done nothing but try to get out of the CAT duty since I was assigned it.  I tried once when I first was assigned it.  I was told no so I dropped it.  Some of the other incidents he mentioned I was ordered to go home by others in the CAT when I was sick.  One of which I had strep.  I didn't know it was strep at the time, but I was ordered to go to the clinic and get tested.  After I protested a few times and said I was fine, I was practically forced out.\n\nThe NCOIC put in for disciplinary action of a letter of reprimand (pretty close to an article 15) and my 1sgt got involved.  She was pissed at first.  Then I explained everything.  She backed down quickly and the LOR was dropped.\n\n**Do not** just immediately take the blame and be a scape goat.

Eat hurriedly so you end up biting down wrong on a hard shell so a piece of it lodges into your gums or pierced the room of your mouth. Don't care, because you're eating tacos. Tacos are awesome. All of them. \n\nEdit:  I've been on Reddit for a few years and this is by far my most commented and replied to comment and I'm happy to see so much love for tacos.  I'm getting Taco Bell tomorrow for sure. Crunchy tacos!\n\nEdit 2: My Taco Bell forecast in the original edit seems to have dichotomized my taco loving brothers and sisters. Don't get me wrong, I love street tacos and being born and raised in California I have my pick of every type of Mexican food restaurant. I even choose street style tacos as the summer grilling entree from time to time. TB has a place in my heart. My Grandma would take me here as a little guy, my friends and I would ride across town as teenagers back when kids did that kind of stuff, and today, I still love a bean and cheese burrito. But, I get it. I get why many see that as a poor representation of Mexican food. And I agree.

You have no idea what kind of history a dog may have. One of my rescues is blind in one eye and was used as a bait-dog in a past life. She is extremely docile and has never bitten anyone, but that doesn't mean she won't under a perfect storm of circumstances. \nIf the owner says it's OK, kneel down to their level and let them sniff you.

He's just shy!\" and then reach down with your gigantic, unfamiliar hand to touch him, I'm not going to apologize when he growls and lunges at you.  \n\nI read once about a movement to make color codes flags on leashes (green means friendly, red means stay away) a universally known thing.

After I rescued my dog, who was 3 years old at the time, I tried to slowly socialize her by taking her to the park when very few people were there, as she was abused before I got her, and anyone who approached her seemed as a threat to her.\n\nShe was getting better and even allowed people near her, but not to touch her, she'd show teeth, so I'd just advise whoever it was to not come near her as she was scared...\n\nBut then one day, this lady was powerwalking behind me. No big deal, I just moved out of the pathway onto the grass. She stopped, and asked why I moved so far away, leaning down to say hi to my dog. I explained to her my dog's situation, and that she was showing her teeth because she was scared, and to leave her alone, please. \n\nWell, she didn't listen. She followed me close behind, hollering at me, \"You NEED to socialize that dog before it HURTS someone! Let me come near it. Come here, sweetie, it's okay!\" My dog was having none of it. We turned immediately around and B-lined for the park exit. I was disgusted. All I was doing was trying to avoid a lawsuit and trying to take my dog out for some fresh air and sunshine, and this lady made it very hard for me, even after I told her no several times."], [3, "And also, teach your kids to ask first before running over and approaching. The kids running over and being loud can spook anxious dogs, and some dogs are okay with adults but not with children. It teaches the child to be safe as well as having good manners."], [3, "I rarely if ever pet strange dogs. I just offer the back of my hand for sniffing. It's canine for \"hello\".  Sometimes they sniff, sometimes not.  "], [3, "I wish more people not only *knew* this, but would fucking teach their kids this. I have a Husky and kids **love** a fluffy Husky. She likes kids, for the most part. But she's pretty skittish, so if someone, even a child, runs up on her she gets scared easily. For the most part, a parent or child *will* ask first, to which I reply \"yes, but she's really skittish, so go slow. She won't bite, but she might bark so don't get scared.\" But there's **always** that one person who just thinks they can do whatever.\n Case in point: I was at a park, intentionally well away from the other people and the play ground. A little girl, probably 8 or so (definitely old enough to know better), ran about 100 feet from the playground to the middle of the field where I was with my dogs. (Mind you, the entire time this was happening, there was no parent in sight, but I presume she was watching from afar) The little girl didn't acknowledge me or ask to pet my dog but instead bee-lined it straight to my dog, ran right up on her from behind and grabbed her fur. When she made contact, my dog jumped and tried to run. But being on a leash, she only tangled herself around me and my other dog. I told the little girl that she had scared her, to stop and leave her alone until I got her calmed down and then she could pet her. This little girl looked me straight in the fucking eyes, as if she understood what I said, then **immedietely** looked back at my dog and started chasing her around while loudly screeching, making her run around me trying to get away. It got to the point that I was completely tangled and the Husky was at the end of her leash with no where to go. While trying to get control of the situation and untangle myself from the leashed, the little girl still persisted after I continued telling her to stop. This time, she was met with a snarl then a quick snap and yelp. My Husky knows better than to bite people, and never has, but will snap at (never actually making contact with) hands if she feels threatened. This scared the girl who started crying. Out of the crowd of people comes her mom yelling at me to \"get [my] dogs under control and if they act that way around children then [I] shouldn't have brought them to a park around kids.\" I tell her I was tell away from everyone, but her daughter was at fault. But of course, when I tell her it's actually her daughter's fault for running up on her, grabbing her fur, and ignoring me when I told her to stop, she gets pissed off, grabs her daughter by the arm and walks away mumbling under her breathe. I was so afraid this crazy bitch was going to call the police and say my dog bit her daughter (even though she didn't. I watched her snap at the girl, but she didn't get her hand) that I packed up and left."], [3, "Also a good tip: when walking your own dog, have enough control if them so that they don't run up and around the first dog they see. \n\n\nI have a very shy dog that HATES these sudden encounters. I liken a dog running up and sniffing her face/butt to a person coming up to you and grabbing your hand and shaking it while being uncomfortably close to you. It's just rude and bad manners. \n\n\nDon't assume because someone is walking a dog that their dog will totally be okay with your running all over them. \n\nEDIT: I should add I have a very sweet dog who likes to play with others, but does not enjoy being forced into those situations.

When she made contact, my dog jumped and tried to run. But being on a leash, she only tangled herself around me and my other dog. I told the little girl that she had scared her, to stop and leave her alone until I got her calmed down and then she could pet her. This little girl looked me straight in the fucking eyes, as if she understood what I said, then **immedietely** looked back at my dog and started chasing her around while loudly screeching, making her run around me trying to get away.

I was able to get to sleep like any other night, but I inexplicably woke up around 3am that morning. I had this odd feeling in my hands. I decided just to wake up and start my morning, because I had to work at 7 anyway. First, I went out to get the paper, but it was still too early. What I did notice was that all my other neighbors were outside attempting to collect the paper too. I waved at my closest neighbor and asked, \"can't sleep either?\". To which he replied, \"yeah, just having some odd dreams\". We said our goodbyes and I began to make a pot of coffee, although I didn't need it; I was wide awake. The coffee was good that morning, so I sat by the front window and contemplated life a bit. I noticed a lot of traffic going up and down my residential street, and at this time it was still only 4am. I decided to flip on the news and that's when I saw it. CNN, MSNBC, FOX, even The Blaze. They were *all* reporting about a local corner store cashier who had placed the coins *on top* of the bills earlier that night. Police were still investigating, but the damage had been done. They couldn't even get an interview with the victim. I was shocked. I called my boss a little later on to tell her I wouldn't be coming in, she understood. A few others had called in as well, but we didn't expect much business that day anyway (I worked as a baker). After that, many cashiers would attempt the same thing with rude customers, which started scaring consumers away from stores. Companies tried to retrain cashiers to *always always always* place coins in customers hands first, but the cashiers couldn't get enough of this new power. Eventually, some brave customers began to receive change in this manner and not react. Some hero, I think his name was Ben Franklin, received his change in this manner and recorded it to YouTube with the title, \"No Big, Man\". From then on people were mostly desensitized to this new form of change placement.

It's really easy to take things the wrong way when communication is constrained by distance.  If you've ever found that a joke or sarcastic remark you've made in an email (to anyone, not just your SO) has been taken the wrong way, it's like that.\n\nWith me there were times when I'd get off the phone thinking \"How dumb could she be, to do {whatever}.\"  And always it was me misunderstanding the situation.

It'll be a bit windy, but I think very useful if you're serious about progression.\n\nIf you want to be productive, it at the same time means removing anything that seems counter-intuitive to this function. Often times we don't allow our brains to run the most important program in our protocol for advancement -- **The Boredom Program**. We often cover this program with immediate auto-pilot action. For me, it's gaming. I automatically go to gaming, rather than be bored. It's so intense that we label it an addiction.\n\nWhen we remove our autopilot, *Probably Reddit for most here*, we become bored and we begin cycling through things we either need to do, should do, or want to do. **This allows us to start finding the things in our life that will actually push us forward on our personal progressive path**, whether that's as simple as doing the dishes or playing guitar, or as intense as completing work on a dissertation or attempting to break contact with possible mentors.\n\n\"Robot mode\", as /u/wormspike has termed it, is essentially turning off your autopilot, and manually controlling brain function. It's what people could also term **living in the moment** or **conscious action.** We often use this naturally when doing things we love -- In those instances, we often call it **Flow** or **Optimal Experience**. [(Here's a good video by Csikszentmihalyi that can walk you through the basics of it, but it's essentially complete focus on a specific task when it's in a certain difficulty zone when compared to our capability.)](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en)\n\nWhen it comes to closing Reddit, *which obviously comes off as a simple enough task*, it first requires most people to convince their brain that there is something more worthwhile to be doing with their time. \"I could browse Reddit, but, I could also go workout.\" If working out's Pro's vs Con's cause it to have less value on your ranking system of *things to do* than Reddit, it's unlikely you will go do it. *So here's the real secret to getting yourself making progress and turning off Reddit* --> \n\n**You have to adjust your value ratings.** \n\nYou need to begin to see the things that assist in your progression as more valuable than the things that deter said progression. Doing this isn't easy, but it also isn't that difficult -- It just takes time. It generally begins and ends with the use of meta-cognition.\n\nIf you've read all this, you're still with me, and interested in learning more, feel free to let me know and I am more than willing to continue. Otherwise, here are a few books that really helped unlock my mind and allow me to go from a lazy, chubby, depressed gamer to an in-shape, motivated, 4.0 student.\n\n**Edit**  Forgot to link the books. Smart guy here. \n\n**The art of Learning** by Josh Waitzkin - http://www.joshwaitzkin.com/the-art-of-learning/ (A great run down of Josh Waitzkin, who was the subject for the movie \"Searching for Bobby fisher.\" He essentially looks back on his life and utilizes his hindsight to realize how his training and learning experience crafted him into a brilliant chess master as a young child and then allowed him to go on to achieve worldwide martial arts acclaim.

(However, Last night I was a bit tired and I think I rambled more than necessary.)\n\nThis guy used the examples of waking up and giving himself instructive programming in order to complete each task of his morning as if each **single step** in completing said task was actually a complete task of it's own.\n\nLet's look at my basic routine every morning. I wake up at 8am every morning, my girlfriend sleeps longer. So Making the bed is sort of out of the question. \n\n* Wake up\n* Go to the bathroom.\n* Go to the kitchen.\n* Put away all dry dishes (No dishwasher).\n* Wash any dishes in sink.\n* Stretch.\n* Read X pages / X chapters of current book.\n* Make breakfast.\n* Eat breakfast, continue reading as desired beyond pre-stated amount, or get on Reddit (Maximum of 30 minutes.)\n* Prepare my Planner for the day.\n\n**Now, This is a list of complete tasks I do each day. Not steps.** Each one is actually an entire goal that I feel good about completing each day. Making breakfast is what I'm going to zone in on.\n\nThe steps of making breakfast break down quite a bit for me, and if I find myself having trouble wanting to do so, I can simply engage myself consciously. I need to not let my autopilot program of procrastination impact my progression.\n\n*\"Go to kitchen, Open fridge, Remove egg carton, Remove Onion, Remove cheese, Remove black beans, Remove avocado, Remove Butter, Remove milk. Open egg carton, remove two eggs, close egg carton, place carton back in fridge, close fridge. Open cabinet, Take out pan, Close cabinet, Place pan on stove, Put butter in pan, Turn stove on medium-high heat...\"*\n\n**I could continue like that for another 30-40 steps. When we cook, we see a recipe that lists every step involved, but we often times don't realize how much that guidance helps us.**\n\nWhen I was in the Military, basic training pushed us to do things just like this. There was a very specific way to roll socks and shirts, fold towels, make our bed. We had to measure things, take steps, be exact. Doing so however caused our brains to focus on these simple mundane tasks so intensely that we weren't busy focusing on stresses that we couldn't do anything about, or think about useless or sidetracking things that are bad for progression.\n\nIt's easy for most of us to do this if we have a Drill Sgt or an MTI screaming down at us to do it. It's pretty easy to complete tasks for school when you know you have to do them. It's easy to focus on work when you're getting paid for it and you have the repercussion of being fired if you don't. Creating this motivation on your own is far more difficult, especially since most of the time your brain is simply telling you \"Man, I don't want to do anything but sit around and play computer games.\"\n\n**We can be our own drill sergeant** But, It takes work. It takes time. It takes routine, and routine starts with one step. One step turns into one basic morning task. One morning task turns into more morning tasks which allows us to get ourselves moving in a positive progressive direction.\n\nThere is a quote I like, **Some people quit due to slow progress, Never grasping the fact that slow progress... Is Progress.**\n\nThe real point to notice here though, is that progress is relative. Yes, we use tasks to measure progress throughout our day, **but we use *Steps* to measure our progress throughout a task.** And, we use the size or number of our tasks completed to measure or Rate of progression. There are multiple layers of progression to be had. It starts with one step in the direction you want to go.", "id": "d6o6dp3"}, {"comment": "I really appreciate you giving such a full response. It confirms a lot of what I've been thinking and have been learning. It seems like you have an audience, so feel free to share some more. I'd love to read it. Do you have a blog or something where you share these things?\n \nWhat's your take on adjusting your values? I have consciously thought about what I want my values to be, however they don't stick as often as I'd hope. Any techniques? ", "id": "d6nkue1"}, {"comment": "I used to run a website based on music and improving your overall well-being, but I had a few issues with it. Honestly, I spend most of my extra time now reading and hiking/camping with my girlfriend.\n\nIt's great that you've spent time consciously thinking about your value system. We all have dreams, but the hardest part is materializing them.\n\nSince it does seem that there are a few people interested, I'm going to do the best I can to use my own experiences in a generalized fashion so that the hopefully the imagery can be picked up by each unique perspective. \n\nLet's go back to the fitness and Reddit/Gaming. I didn't used to work out much. It was too easy to sit around and play WoW, and I mean I was a young kid, I was in decent enough shape right? Even when I began gaining weight, I still didn't see the real value in eating healthy and working out.\n\nOver time though, I began realizing a few things. \n\n1 - **Working out makes you feel productive**. Even if I sat around the rest of the day playing computer, \"I worked out today, so my body is progressing. Today was a progressive day.\" Sure it wasn't much, but, *at least it was something*.\n\n2- **After I started getting over the starting hump, working out really made me feel happier**. I was noticing that on days I worked out, I felt better. I felt better about myself, I looked better, I was prouder of myself. I felt more like a man and less like a boy.\n\n3- **Working out allowed me to set little goals that added up to big gains**. We talk about this all the time in development, but it's extremely important to realize and accomplishing goals. We generally think in the long term or set non-specific goals for ourselves like *Buy a car, Get good grades, work out more*. The definition of good or more is too subjective and shifts, so it doesn't give us the same satisfaction as say *\"I'm going to do 12 reps on this set. I've only ever done 10, but today I'm doing 12.\"* It's such a small yet imperative difference. \n\n**This point is so important I want to try and connect it directly**\n\nYou can't measure good, good does not offer progression. The word \"Less\" doesn't mean anything unless you attribute values. \"I'm gonna be on Reddit Less... But I don't actually know how long I spend on it a day... How will I know if it's less???\"  You can however measure 10 to 12. You can measure 3 hours a day on reddit vs 2 and a half hours. You can measure distance. You can measure time. You can measure pages/chapters read in a book. You can measure the money you spend in a day. You can measure the number of tasks you get done in a day. You can measure the number of times you eat out each week. The number of times you cook each week. *\"Yesterday I did 3 chores around the house. Today I did 4. Tomorrow I don't have to do any. I'm ahead of myself.\"*\n\n**I do this intensely.** I write in a planner all of my daily tasks and cross them out as I do them. I tracked the time I played games, and the number of games I played untill I realized I couldn't responsibly play games. I am an addict, I have to completely uninstall them all to be able to function in the way I want. Figuring this out was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.\n\n4- **Working out was working. I was getting in shape and people were treating me differently** In fact, I was treating myself differently. I was confident and I was proud about something I was allowed to be proud about. I wasn't being a braggart, I just knew I was fat and out of shape, and then one day I wasn't. One day I was the guy who knew what he was doing, the guy training other guys, helping other people the way people had helped me.\n\nSo now we know what we want **(dreams and goals)**\n\nWe know that we have assigned a value system to them. **(Pro's and Con's, each with an associated weight)**\n\nSo how do we deal with the fact that they don't stick? How do we adjust those values?\n\nThat's what I referred to as **Meta-Cognition**, or, thinking about how you think. The google definition is *awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes.*\n\nEssentially metacognition is what the then Wachowski brothers were discussing as the key to Neo unlocking the ability to do anything. Our core programming tells us to act in a certain way, this programming is constantly altered by our environment and social interactions. Think about this...\n\nHow can you learn something without first being taught it? Can we simply \"Gain\" knowledge? No, not without experience. That experience can come in the form of *actual experience or what people may call street smarts*, or *from person to person transfer of knowledge.* Generally this *secondhand smarts* is what we refer to as book smarts, although book smarts generally gets associated with this recent trend of \"Shit you learn in schools\".\n\nSo I know that if I play computer games, I will play way too much and think about them whenever I'm not. I don't pay close attention to what I'm doing elsewhere, I just rush through it so that I can \"Get back to the gaming.\" My quality of work decreases, my ability to get to the gym becomes compromised, and due to these issues, I get stressed about the things I'm not taking care of. The anxiety then causes me to feel awful, and I slip into bouts of depression.\n\nHowever, I have two special weapons to use in this fight.\n\n1- **I know this. I know I have this problem.**\n\n2- **I'm honest with myself. I admit I have this problem.**\n\nSo the answer is to remove the item completely. Yeah, It's a daily struggle, but I combat it with different tactics and by making it hard for myself to do. I make sure to keep myself busy. I write in my planner the stuff I have to do, I keep myself on those goals and take responsibility when I don't accomplish them. Also, if the games are uninstalled, I can't simply play them. I have to reinstall and go through a bunch of shit that makes it much less worth it. Unfortunately that's much harder to do with Reddit, it's pretty easy to pick up your phone and head to the site.\n\n***However... If this is your problem and you know it and can admit it, you can work on changing it.***\n\n\"Whenever I'm bored I reach for my phone and get on reddit, then I stay on and next thing you know I'm down a large chunk of my free time.\"\n\n^ That's your Auto-pilot program. You need to bypass that program. The next time you find yourself reaching for your phone  to burn some time on Reddit, or getting on a computer game, or sitting in front of the T.V, or whatever it may be, Set a timer for 15 or 30 minutes. When it goes off you'll know how long you've been on. **Get off, or at the very least. Set another timer.** After a bit, you will either start realizing that the timer is working or you should start really grasping how much of your time you are spending. Then you can start decreasing it as slowly as you want. 3 hours to 2 hours and 55 minutes. 2:55 to 2:50. Every little bit will really help.\n\n**Shit this is a long post.** I'm really sorry for how longwinded this is, but it's an extremely complex topic that really shifts drastically for each person's unique experiences and perspective. \n\nThat's where the meta-cognition comes into play. You have to recognize what is creating your perspective. *\"Why do I give more value to sitting on my ass in front of this computer than taking care of my physical body when I know it's fucking up the future I envision wanting.\"*  \n\n**Why do you? Can you be honest with yourself?**\n\nI'm gonna come back tomorrow and do another comment specifically explaining conscious action since I know that was really what most people were asking about, but I wanted to touch on this first since part of conscious action is the ability to zone in on whatever is your current task. This is difficult if you head is always in another place, trying to be on Reddit, thinking about a game, or a girl, or whatever.\n\nHoly shit I can't imagine anyone is still reading this. \n\nMuch love to those of you who are.", "id": "d6nqzxa"}, {"comment": "Thanks for this comment.
