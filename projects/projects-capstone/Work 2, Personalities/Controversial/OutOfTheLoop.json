So a bill passing \"Congress\" would, by definition, already have Senate approval.\n\n2) A majority of bills can start in either chamber--only specific things, such as the budget, are limited in where they start (\"HR\" denotes House bills & \"S\" denotes Senate bills). Bills are often introduced in both houses at the same time. Bills that start in the Senate would require, to use your phrasing, House approval & bills that start in the House would require Senate approval.\n\n3) It's not actually a constant thing at all, as Congress is out of session for a portion of the year, and, thus, not passing legislation for the president to sign. Even when they are in session, votes aren't really a daily thing. We're talking about a roughly 6 month average for a bill to go from introduction to law, with a majority of bills introduced dying in committee.\n\n3a) Given that a majority of the votes are simply to pass it to the other chamber, rather than to POTUS' desk, hypothetical daily votes would have little impact on the president's responsibility.", "id": "d9rjmri"}], [{"comment": "Legacy shopping ", "id": "d8nlt1v"}, {"comment": "More like \"pre election panic\".

The 1905 law stresses that la\u00efcit\u00e9 is supposed to protect people's freedom to live their religion freely. (The *state* is separated from all Churches, does not recognize any of them, but the state is also there to make sure that anyone is free to live his or her faith -or lack of).\n\n-\"the burkini  is not correct, doesn't respect morality\" = complete bullshit, I can't believe they actually wrote than in this municipal by-law. (well, they didn't write \"the burkini\": they wrote \"any person whose outfit isn't correct, respectful of morality...\" but that's what it means).\n\n-\"hygiene\" = bullshit.)\n\nIt's important to note that the Council of State will probably be seized: the League of Human Rights as well as a Collective against Islamophobia already tried to appeal these municipal by-law decrees. I don't see how that's Constitutional, so I think they will be repelled (but you never know... I'm not 100% confident).\n\nPoliticians are making the news thanks to this \"controversy\". It always works: in France we have had \"controversies\"/\"public debates\" regarding islam-connected behaviors every 2 or 3 months in the last decade. It sells paper, makes for great TV ratings and great political polls. The presidential election is next year. The right-wing primary is about to start... \n\n ", "id": "d6qdmxz"}, {"comment": "I was told by my high school French teacher that you're not supposed to wear any religious clothing at all in public in France. Is that true?", "id": "d6qjy31"}, {"comment": "That's not true at all, but it's not really surprising to hear a french person saying it.\n\nIn France, we hear about \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" all the time, but the definition of this  term has gradually evolved, which means that we often don't know what we are talking about, since two totally different definitions exist: many people are convinced that \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" means \"live (and leave) your religion at home\". They think that the value of la\u00efcit\u00e9 should apply to the \"public sphere\"  (ie everywhere: in schools, at work, in the street). \n\nIn reality, the 1905 law on the separation between the State and the Churches is clear: the *state* (and its representatives) are the only ones who should abstain to openly \"publicize\" their faith. The law stresses that any citizen should be protected, so that he or she can live and practise his/her faith (or absence of faith) freely. (The law explains that no one should force his or her religious beliefs on you -and especially not the State-, but also that no one should prevent you from living your faith, or expressing your religious beliefs -you just can't be \npushing your proselytizing because that would indeed breach the value of la\u00efcit\u00e9).\n\n\nThese two different interpretations of the term \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" have always existed (the debate that happened one century ago and led to the promulgation of the 1905 law was pretty much the same, and those who were advocating a \"restrictive\" vision lost; they wanted to forbid priests to be able to wear their cassock/soutane in the streets: this idea was detered, because most people wanted a law that would enable citizens to have their religious freedom protected). So basically, you have on the one hand people who see \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" as a legal principle (to ensure the state doesn't push one religion over another but also allows citizens to live their faith freely), and on the other hand, people who see \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" has a \"republican value\" (who believe that religious beliefs should be kept \"private\", and that it should apply to citizens too). This last category of people seems to think that \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" is a core value of the french republic: ie, they strongly believe it should be pushed even harder so that the \"national identity\" is not compromised. So, they think that islam, being a \"new\" religion whose flock are more practising (than the declining catholics), they should be more discreet and \"assimilate\" into french society, otherwise that means they don't want to integrate themselves... (Actually France is one the country with the smallest amount of believers, and muslims aren't that much more practising than catholics. The number of french women wearing a burqa is very very small, and the number of french muslim women wearing a simple veil is also a small minority actually.

The film is going to be great, but you'd never know that from a trailer.\n\nit's odd how reddit will defend a film with a poor trailer, but this one was like a godsend to the nerds who already hated it for \"pandering\" to women by having four female leads(instead of four men, which shouldn't make a difference), who lept onto it once the trailer came out, switching almost instantly from \"haha women, what pandering SJW trash\" to pretending to be on womens' sides, and how \"offensive and sexist\" the trailer was, which to me suggests there was some kind of agenda involved.\n\nthe movie will be fine.

That's the point of the trailer, to market a product to consumers.  If the commercial doesn't properly represent the product to the consumer, then it's a failure.  No one should have to watch additional marketing materials in order to be sold on a product.  \n\nThe Ghostbusters trailer is a perfect example of bad marketing and how not to sell a film.  If they had run this [fan-made trailer instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IDXpOX0Cp0), we probably wouldn't even be having this discussion.   The fact that a fan understands who the audience actually is and can cut a trailer into something the fans like, but the studio making the film cannot does not bode well for the finished product.\n\nAs for the anti-woman agenda?  The only people I see spouting that nonsense are the SJWs themselves.  It's just not a serious talking point among the fandom.  Currently, the official Ghostbusters trailer has almost half a million dislikes, and most of the negative comments were from women who felt let down (before Sony deleted them).   It just goes to show that SJWs don't really care about women, they only care about their 'outrage culture' and perceived victimhood.  \n\nAs we have just had an entire slew of amazing, award-winning films with woman leads, I am fairly disappointed in the trailer.  I thought we were past this kind of (in your own words) pandering, sexist, offensive crap, but apparently not.   It was so cliche, I'm actually surprised there wasn't a scene in the trailer where all the women were dancing around a table in a kitchen.  If I had to bet though, there probably IS a scene like that in the film itself, or at least something just as insipid like a public sing along, or a crowd-surfing scene where someone gets dropped, or a makeover-scene where one of them walks down the stairs: please let me be wrong.\n\nNevertheless, I'm still hoping the film will be fine, as you say.  The studios marketed The Witch all wrong, and that turned out to be great.  They also nearly destroyed Stranger Than Fiction, which turned out to be fantastic drama, but was marketed as a slapstick comedy.  Also, let's not forget the Iron Giant.  I just don't understand why studios consistently mis-market their own films, or try to sell a film as one genre when it's clearly another.

A good game isn't really so good anymore if it's uncomfortable to play because of technical issues.\n\nEDIT: Also, in the case of games that do maintain a solid 30FPS with no hitches but people are disappointed anyway, sometimes it's just a conflict with how the game is played. Virtually every game benefits from a higher refresh rate, but for some it's borderline necessary for gameplay fluidity or people sensitive to motion sickness.", "id": "d6ljbwq"}, {"comment": "I see. This makes sense and thank you for the well thought response. It still seems like the flavor of the week to point out the FPS of a game to me. It seems like a majority of threads have this conversation when it comes to a newer release as if it has always been a factor in enjoyment when typically past discussions I've never seen much comment regarding the performance of the refresh rate.\n\n\nThank you again!", "id": "d6lk3u5"}, {"comment": "I'd also like to add, a lot of people (myself included) don't mind visual downgrades to a game if it means that it plays smoother (solid 60). So many publishers and developers these days opt for the \"schweet graphics\" that 30FPS gives you because it looks good in trailers and screenshots. 60FPS gameplay can't have as many visual effects on the same hardware compared to 30FPS and a lot of people (myself included) tend to favor that smoothness in animation over extra bells and whistles that are often more distracting than helpful to the gameplay.\n\nA good example of this is maybe Shadow of the Colossus which, while an amazing game on the PS2, was so technically hindered by its poor framerate that it arguably wasn't fully realized until the PS3 HD version which improved the fluidity significantly. It's one of my favorite games of all time now that I can play it without fighting the framerate.", "id": "d6lku42"}, {"comment": "So in that case, people should be focusing on how stable the FPS is, not what number it's supposed to run at.

Like I said, some games are just better at higher refresh rates. We've been used to 30 for so long that playing around with 60+ feels like a whole new world. Racing, FPS, fighting, and platforming games are objectively their best when played at a framerate at least twice that of 30 because they're so much more action focused. Is it the end of the world if a game is locked at 30? Not really but it does sometimes look and feel bad for some games and there's no arguing that it wouldn't be better if it ran faster, right? ", "id": "d6m5isz"}, {"comment": "Not quite, in my experience. Faster does not always look better, I find a lot of more cinematic games tend to feel awkward at 60FPS, and it's a lot harder to be frame-perfect if there are twice as many frames going by per second (I know that most games that run at 60FPS are lenient on input windows for this very reason, but on games' designed for 30 FPS, it breaks things.)\n\nHonestly, I don't get the obsession with frames. What feels good to me is what feels good, it doesn't have to have any particular specs to accomplish that.", "id": "d6m5sy9"}, {"comment": ">cinematic\n\nOh boy, [here we go...](https://xkcd.com/386/)\n\nOkay, first of all, \"cinematic\" video games is an oxymoron. The only thing that is cinematic is cinema and video games are basically the opposite; they're interactive, not bound by the arbitrary restraints of film, and exist for more reason than delivering audiovisual content. Video games can try and emulate the feel of a movie but saying that they look *better* with *less* visual information being thrown at you per-second is just completely wrong and honestly makes me think you might be a little too attached to what is essentially a visual standard set by technical limitations rather than any artistic vision (99% of the time anyway). Film is only at 24fps - not 30, mind you, but 24, which doesn't even display correctly on most consumer TVs - because it's considered the bare minimum of how fast frames should be going by to appear like motion. It was an efficiency thing from back in the day and it says absolutely nothing about what looks better to the human eye. If there were ever an argument for a \"cinematic\" framerate (which, as noted, doesn't even exist in games anyway) it would be that, because you don't see as much information every second, it helps mentally blur the imperfections in the image as you don't notice them quite as much. This was actually the reason why some people (not me, but some people) didn't like when The Hobbit ran at 48fps in some theaters, because it made the CGI look more fake next to the human actors due to twice as much visual information being available per-second to make the difference more apparent. If anything that says more about our modern visual effects than high framerates as a movie like Toy Story or How To Train Your Dragon would look phenomenal with a higher framerate.\n\nObviously though, with video games, you don't get that uncanny valley effect quite as often (though we sometimes did back in the PS1/2 days) because everything is computer graphics anyway. It just looks more smooth, period.\n\nSecond, about this:\n\n> it's a lot harder to be frame-perfect if there are twice as many frames going by per second\n\nThis is completely false and also dependent on the intentional design of the game. See, most games these days run on a time delta as opposed to a strict number of frames per second. Some still do, mainly fighting games, but by running at a variable framerate you can scale better up and down so that your game doesn't slow down. If you're playing a game like Uncharted and it hits a snag where it goes down from 30fps to 15, the game might just display half as many frames instead of slowing the game down. But the thing is, the game isn't registering your inputs 15 times a second; it's registering them whenever you press them anyway and then showing their results 15 times per second at 15 dynamic moments. That, and like you said, if a game really needs specifically sized input windows it can just dynamically scale them based on the framerate or otherwise interpolate animations while still locking inputs to 30/60fps. Heck, you could even write a game that takes inputs at 60fps and output 30fps visuals. It's not that complicated and the only people to blame for games where this is a problem (I can't think of any off the top of my head) are the programmers and/or designers of these games; it's not like there's some inherent limitation for inputs in gaming that is still a problem. There are just a lot of older games out there that weren't designed with variable framerates in mind, but we're moving in that direction everywhere in gaming and it's a great thing that we are.\n\nFor some games that do operate on strict frame times like a lot of 2D platformers and fighting games, I think it would be very hard to argue that more precision would be bad for the player, wouldn't you agree?\n\n> but on games' designed for 30 FPS, it breaks things\n\nSo what you're saying is... we should just make games designed with variable framerates to begin with and not make sloppy coding decisions that hurt players and aren't forward-thinking? That's what I'd say. Very few kinds of games can get away with coding for a very specific framerate these days and honestly those that do often have a legitimate reason, but 90%+ don't. A turn-based strategy game, for example, should not need an arbitrarily low framerate cap for any good reason. But a game like the old-school Mario or Mega Man games, which are rooted in classic 2D design principles, would be just fine running at a fixed framerate as long as it's not too low. However, that doesn't mean that being able to run at a higher framerate would be bad for it.\n\nI've got a 144hz monitor that I game with regularly and while a lot of games don't properly support going quite so high, you'd be amazed at how beautiful some games are at high framerates. DOOM at 90-120FPS is truly a sight to see and it really benefits the fast, frantic gameplay. Heck, even solving puzzles in The Witness feels more engaging when I can walk around the world and it feels like I'm looking through a window (in an exaggerated sense of course) instead of something that's obviously a computer screen. The higher framerate makes images more believable, more beautiful, and all-around more engaging for the player. It's more immersive.\n\nI'm not going to label you with any kind of stockholm syndrome-esque condition here; some people just like what they like, and maybe you don't see the benefit of 60FPS+. That's fine, no need to care for it if you don't need it. However, \"it looks weird to me\" just screams \"I'm not used to it yet\" from my and many other peoples' perspectives. Being okay with 30fps is one thing, but being so used to 30fps that anything more feels \"weird\" is what I would consider a problem.\n\nEither way, it's not really much of a reason to discount other people wanting more 60FPS+ games, is it? Let people ask for what they think is important in gaming. It shouldn't bother you; if you really, desperately don't want a 60fps game there are artificial ways to reduce your framerate by half to simulate a \"cinematic\" experience, if necessary.", "id": "d6m6vgj"}, {"comment": "I'm not saying I don't want 60 FPS games, I just don't really care about the specs, as long as it feels good, and runs at a stable rate.

How do you think voting works, or you making this submission works or...\n\nI think he is talking about how Reddit can go down relatively easily despite being fairly low bandwidth (I'm guessing this is why he says it's just 'text and CSS' as opposed to flashy media)  - yet they are getting their own image hosting service, which isn't low bandwidth at all. \n\nThis also seems a little odd to me, especially when a service like Imgur already exists. Reddit are basically re-inventing the wheel so they can say that the service the site uses is theirs and not someone else's.\n\nI would speculate that this is profit driven. They will be able to sell ad space on the image hosting site, especially if they force some kind of 'gallery view' for every incoming link. This ties in with the recent change to external product links becoming 'hidden affiliate' links for Reddit - there is a drive right now to make the site more profitable/sustainable in the long term.", "id": "d3z8f29"}, {"comment": "Yeah, well, when the site is down, it isn't just about bandwidth. Let's not forget that reddit serves millions of users every day, so the issues have to do with having a pretty big infrastructure, using CDNs etc. When the site is down, most of the time it's because of [database issues, memcache issues, etc.](http://www.redditstatus.com/history). So this simplistic view paints a wrong picture. Even when pictures are bigger than a bunch of text files, at this scale, bandwidth for serving images is not the thing that will cause many problems, it's the infrastructure that breaks the site.\n\n> They will be able to sell ad space on the image hosting site, especially if they force some kind of 'gallery view' for every incoming link. \n\nNot forcing ads on their images is the only thing they have that is better than imgur. They don't seem to be planing to do that. From the announcement:\n\n> Click on a Reddit-hosted image from any listing (such as the frontpage, a subreddit, or userpage) and be taken directly to the conversation and comments about that image.\n\nAnd it's on that page they can display ads. Why create an extra gallery page to display ads, when you can do it within reddit? Why create another ad selling platform? Why have more adspace, when so many slots on the main site are empty most of the time (so empty, they let subreddits advertise for free). That's another website they'd have to maintain as well. Not to mention how confusing it'd be for people wanting to run ads. I mean, I'm not saying you are wrong, they do make weird choices. It just seems really illogical to me.\n\nThey are trying to earn more by hosting their own images, though. There is so much traffic they lose to imgur, because people find one image here and end up staying on imgur. They get to keep that traffic if all images are hosted by reddit itself at some point.", "id": "d3z8uug"}, {"comment": "So do you reckon it's all about keeping the traffic rather than have it spill out? I can see that, but not quite sure how to monetize it if they aren't going to serve any extra ads. Just seems like an odd choice to me, image hosting isn't cheap on the scale Reddit would require and I'm not sure that the cost would be offset through user retention alone.\n\nYou are right though, Reddit do make some odd business decisions so maybe this is one of those.

He is the foremost Renaissance artist. Artist's credibility adds to the paintings popularity.\nNapoleon Bonaparte hung the painting in his master bedroom in 1800. This - I think - was the first tipping point of making the painting one of the most popular paintings in the world.\n1804, Mona Lisa is hung in the Louvre - and others can now glimpse at the painting that Napoleon slept with.\nBut the real tipping point for the paintings popularity only hit in August of 1911 - when Mona Lisa is stolen. Stolen from heavily secured Louvre which experts said was impossible. No one knows who stole it or how. Conspiracy theories abound. The painting is talked about in every newspaper.\nAfter 2 weeks of much fan fare, Police arrest Guillaume Apollinaire on suspicion of theft. He is the only person they have arrested. Apollinaire implicates Pablo Picasso. The rumor of Picasso stealing the Mona Lisa adds in a lot more fuel in making Mona Lisa very very popular.\nPicasso is questioned and released. Guillaume Apollinaire himself is released after 5 days. Everyone is still clueless as to who stole the painting.

If you complete that you're issued another card that expires in 12-18 months and validates your carry permit for the duration.

Apple is consistent, and regardless if if you like them or their pricing system, they make objectively good products. Android, which is what I prefer, offers a ton of customisation even without rooting (my phone provider even allows me to root and encourages it, which no other service providers nor Apple do for Jailbreaking).  iOS is catching up on customisation and if you jailbreak is already there.  Android certainly has less quality control for their 3rd party software, which can sometimes be a good thing, allowing you to get cheaper or better software.

I *think* now it's really something totally different and much more involved.  There are people so obsessed with gaming they are basically recluse and have very little interest in anything else.  I think this level of obsession came with the rise of the internet, online games and communities where they can virtually surround themselves with like-minded people.  Then there are the pro-players that make money in various ways and it's pretty much a career.  For me, I went from Atari to Nintendo, to Super-NES, then I switched to PC-based games and was very involved in Sim-related games and did beta-testing for a while, etc.  Even at that time I never called myself a \"gamer\", maybe I was, but I had a full-time job, relationships and other hobbies.  Now it's all very casual.  A few simple games on my smart phone or I download and check out a free trial PC game from time to time.  "], [1, "It started when video games became more available for casual users. \n\nThe first real casual game I would argue would be solitaire that was installed with Windows 3.1, then other puzzle games, originally on Java and Flash became popular in the 90s. \n\nThe difference between \"gamer\" and non \"gamer\" started with the Nintendo 64 and Gamecube. Nintendo because they wanted their kid friendly status denied licenses to many violent games. \n\nThis got Nintendo reputation as a system for kids and non serious gamers, and then the success of the Wii sort of solidified the reputation of Nintendo as a casual system. \n\nHowever, Super Smash Brothers is a game that's played competitively by serious gamers and also is kid friendly. \n\nSo people that play Smash or any other competitive game want to be known as \"gamers\" because they want the game mechanics focused on competitive gaming. \n\nThese people want games to be known as a legitimate sport or art, unlike the people that play Candy Crush or Bejeweled. \n\n"], [0, "I am a GameDev\n\nAlso I am a wannabe politician (I ran for elections recently for the first time, but lost).\n\nI can't post detailed sources now, but I can explain what I learned, including during college (I went to a game business school, although my degree is in design).\n\nBasically, you have several uses of the word gamer in history, all around a central core, but with shifting meaning.\n\n1. In \"ancient\" times for game culture, being a \"gamer\" was mostly about being an alien to the mainstream group, many \"gamers\" lived in places where they were the only gamer they knew, and back then it was the height of the D&D paranoia (when people thought that D&D was satanism and there was those bizarre trials over satanist kindergarden schools).\n\n2. Then as games became a bit more accepted, \"gamer\" as a word became a status near \"nerd\", something to describe a tribe/niche that is admired but hated at the same time.\n\n3. Casual games then showed up, being a \"gamer\" then became a matter of separating the games themselves, tastes, etc...\n\n4. Also, at the same time as \"3\", it was when \"Girl Gamers\" showed up, women that claim to be gamers in a way to get boyfriends, it wasn't much, but it spawned whole fetish communities, and also spawned lots of online hate, with some people wanting those \"girl gamers\" even if they weren't actual gamers, and others hating that someone was using their hobby as means to an unrelated end, \"corrupting\" it.\n\n5. Then, tied to 2, 3 and 4 at the same time, we had the GameGate incident... I won't discuss GamerGate in its entirety here, only one very important point: before GamerGate was called GamerGate, journalists that were in a secret group decided to do some kind of serious demoralizing attack on gamers in an attempt to \"win\", they wrote the infamous \"gamers are dead\" pieces, where about 25 journalists wrote articles criticizing the perceived gamer culture (the people that called themselves gamers for the previous reasons listed) and trying to tie it with racism and misoginy. This pissed them off, and spawned \"GamerGate\" and one of the craziest flamewars in internet history.\n\n6. Now being a gamer is not just a way to describe a niche, being a gamer now has two meanings: first, to say that you play games, since it is now a common thing, it is also common, but most importantly, the second meaning is political, to say that you are a gamer in the open, is also to say that you might be part of political movements that are frequently perceived (correctly or not) to be tied to gamergate, for example Trump supporters, anti-feminists, alt-right, /pol/, white supremacists, anti-LBGT rights, MRAs, and so on...\n\nNow a link to the most infamous \"Gamers are Dead\" article, because it was posted first, and in one of the most famous sites (and many people suspect the author of that article was one of the \"leaders\" of the idea of posting 25 articles in a row that are quasi identical).\n\nhttp://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/224400/Gamers_dont_have_to_be_your_audience_Gamers_are_over.php\n\nAn incomplete-ish list of the articles, I found by googling it now.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2gsslk/is_there_a_list_of_all_the_gamers_are_dead/\n\nFor people too lazy to click the above link or something, here is the title of some articles, and why the word \"gamer\" became important.\n\n* \"Gamers' don't have to be your audience.

You're completely correct that the PlayStation and Xbox's sixth and seventh generation products with a more mature marketing message shot the industry into the mainstream, so it's then that you saw the term being used in a wider convention.", "id": "d95utln"}], [{"comment": "I used to think \"gamer\" meant some who enjoy video games as a main source of entertainment.  I *think* now it's really something totally different and much more involved.  There are people so obsessed with gaming they are basically recluse and have very little interest in anything else.  I think this level of obsession came with the rise of the internet, online games and communities where they can virtually surround themselves with like-minded people.  Then there are the pro-players that make money in various ways and it's pretty much a career.  For me, I went from Atari to Nintendo, to Super-NES, then I switched to PC-based games and was very involved in Sim-related games and did beta-testing for a while, etc.  Even at that time I never called myself a \"gamer\", maybe I was, but I had a full-time job, relationships and other hobbies.  Now it's all very casual.  A few simple games on my smart phone or I download and check out a free trial PC game from time to time.  ", "id": "d95fkg2"}, {"comment": "Honestly, I think the label didn't change; the market did. Gaming was way more niche back in the day and to be a \"gamer\" meant you were into a niche hobby. But now *everybody* plays games and so you're probably not a gamer unless you're playing something that's just a tad more under-the-radar, and in particular playing to a level of near-obsession and mastery that the mainstream market doesn't.\n\nLike the difference between seeing a few movies a year and being a cinephile.\n\nAnd even back then (mid 90s to early 2000s) \"gamer\" had the connotation of being an identity which was under attack from mainstream society, trying to ban games as \"murder simulators\" or assume you were violent. There was something a little dangerous to being into GTAIII or Soldier of Fortune. The term gained the tone of a conservative identity along the lines of a \"war on Christmas\" battle against academia and progressivism more recently.", "id": "d95qfi5"}], [{"comment": "It started when video games became more available for casual users. \n\nThe first real casual game I would argue would be solitaire that was installed with Windows 3.1, then other puzzle games, originally on Java and Flash became popular in the 90s. \n\nThe difference between \"gamer\" and non \"gamer\" started with the Nintendo 64 and Gamecube. Nintendo because they wanted their kid friendly status denied licenses to many violent games. \n\nThis got Nintendo reputation as a system for kids and non serious gamers, and then the success of the Wii sort of solidified the reputation of Nintendo as a casual system. \n\nHowever, Super Smash Brothers is a game that's played competitively by serious gamers and also is kid friendly. \n\nSo people that play Smash or any other competitive game want to be known as \"gamers\" because they want the game mechanics focused on competitive gaming. \n\nThese people want games to be known as a legitimate sport or art, unlike the people that play Candy Crush or Bejeweled. \n\n", "id": "d95bk0r"}], [{"comment": "I am a GameDev\n\nAlso I am a wannabe politician (I ran for elections recently for the first time, but lost).\n\nI can't post detailed sources now, but I can explain what I learned, including during college (I went to a game business school, although my degree is in design).\n\nBasically, you have several uses of the word gamer in history, all around a central core, but with shifting meaning.\n\n1. In \"ancient\" times for game culture, being a \"gamer\" was mostly about being an alien to the mainstream group, many \"gamers\" lived in places where they were the only gamer they knew, and back then it was the height of the D&D paranoia (when people thought that D&D was satanism and there was those bizarre trials over satanist kindergarden schools).\n\n2. Then as games became a bit more accepted, \"gamer\" as a word became a status near \"nerd\", something to describe a tribe/niche that is admired but hated at the same time.\n\n3. Casual games then showed up, being a \"gamer\" then became a matter of separating the games themselves, tastes, etc...\n\n4. Also, at the same time as \"3\", it was when \"Girl Gamers\" showed up, women that claim to be gamers in a way to get boyfriends, it wasn't much, but it spawned whole fetish communities, and also spawned lots of online hate, with some people wanting those \"girl gamers\" even if they weren't actual gamers, and others hating that someone was using their hobby as means to an unrelated end, \"corrupting\" it.\n\n5. Then, tied to 2, 3 and 4 at the same time, we had the GameGate incident... I won't discuss GamerGate in its entirety here, only one very important point: before GamerGate was called GamerGate, journalists that were in a secret group decided to do some kind of serious demoralizing attack on gamers in an attempt to \"win\", they wrote the infamous \"gamers are dead\" pieces, where about 25 journalists wrote articles criticizing the perceived gamer culture (the people that called themselves gamers for the previous reasons listed) and trying to tie it with racism and misoginy. This pissed them off, and spawned \"GamerGate\" and one of the craziest flamewars in internet history.\n\n6. Now being a gamer is not just a way to describe a niche, being a gamer now has two meanings: first, to say that you play games, since it is now a common thing, it is also common, but most importantly, the second meaning is political, to say that you are a gamer in the open, is also to say that you might be part of political movements that are frequently perceived (correctly or not) to be tied to gamergate, for example Trump supporters, anti-feminists, alt-right, /pol/, white supremacists, anti-LBGT rights, MRAs, and so on...\n\nNow a link to the most infamous \"Gamers are Dead\" article, because it was posted first, and in one of the most famous sites (and many people suspect the author of that article was one of the \"leaders\" of the idea of posting 25 articles in a row that are quasi identical).\n\nhttp://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/224400/Gamers_dont_have_to_be_your_audience_Gamers_are_over.php\n\nAn incomplete-ish list of the articles, I found by googling it now.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2gsslk/is_there_a_list_of_all_the_gamers_are_dead/\n\nFor people too lazy to click the above link or something, here is the title of some articles, and why the word \"gamer\" became important.\n\n* \"Gamers' don't have to be your audience. 'Gamers' are over\" - Leigh Alexander on Gamasutra\n\n* The death of the \u201cgamers\u201d and the women who \u201ckilled\u201d them - Casey Johnson on Ars Technica\n\n* A Guide to Ending \"Gamers\" - Devin Wilson on Gamasutra\n\n* Sexism, Misogyny, and online attacks: It's a horrible time to consider yourself a gamer - Patrik O'Rouke on Financial Post\n\n* It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Why Are Gamers So Angry? - Arthur Chu on The Daily Beast\n\n\n\nEDIT: Why the downvotes?

"], [0, "[deleted]"]], [[{"comment": "A big reason why the game has so much attention is that it's the first new IP from Blizzard, the guys behind World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm which are all very well known and very popular PC games. I think the last original IP they had was when StarCraft came out in '98 so almost 20 years since they've come out with a completely new universe with new characters. \n\nThey've put a lot of work into it, Overwatch being the remains of another ambitious but ultimately scrapped project named Titan, and like all of Blizzards stuff the videos, comics, and general promotion for the game have been seriously high quality to drum up even more hype. Asides from that, the game itself is just incredibly fun and well polished, at least subjectively as all media is.", "id": "d3bdxp1"}, {"comment": "I'll throw in a couple of other points:\n\n* There was already a long closed beta and a recent open beta period, so many people hyped for the game *know* what they're getting. A lot of cynicism going around these days due to hyped-up games being released to underwhelming reception.\n\n* It appeals to a wide audience: Blizzard fans, those who have played arena shooters like the massively popular Team Fortress 2, those who enjoy first-person shooter games, those who play MOBAs like DotA 2 and LoL...it's also friendly towards more casual players while being fast-paced and complex enough for a competitive scene. Which ties into:\n\n* Blizzard have a *lot* of money, and as we've seen with Heroes of the Storm, they are clearly putting a lot of money, time and resources into pushing newer titles as esports, which generally foster their *own* community. There were already professional teams for HotS and Overwatch emerging in their respective closed betas.\n\nAlong with the animated shorts that look as gorgeous as you'd expect from Blizzard (think 'major film release' quality), I heartily recommend Gamespot's fantastic three-part series on Overwatch and its history ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq-HwvYjLLg), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTMnJ5XJH6Q), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooWpfIazPRE)).", "id": "d3bh4do"}, {"comment": "How does Overwatch appeal to MOBA players? Maybe you're thinking of Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm (which is a MOBA), but Overwatch doesn't have any of the distinguishing aspects of that type of game.

If you play HotS, there's a big similarity in feel when it comes to handling the heroes in Overwatch. Not to mention, a cursory glance at /r/Overwatch will show that a surprisingly big chunk of the community actually comes from DotA2. Which is funny, since Battleborn - a ***far*** smaller game that Overwatch is releasing against - actually is a first-person MOBA, much like Paragon, but it looks like nobody's really talking or caring *too much* about either of them.\n\nAs for Paragon, well their open beta extended stress test weekend was up against Overwatch's open beta, which blew Paragon out of the water ten times over and was, I believe, the biggest open beta participation ever, at just shy of ten million people.", "id": "d3cau4c"}, {"comment": "I'd say it's MOBA influenced in the sense that there are asymmetric characters (as opposed to a game like counter-strike where only the equipment you're carrying differentiates you from each other) and that you must use teamwork to get the most out of your character type. It doesn't have lanes, AI, or anything like that. Battleborn (by gearbox) is almost exactly LoL or DOTA 2 in FPS. I've played both and Battleborn just wasn't that interesting as MOBA, nor as an FPS game to me.

So when a young black man gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered \"news\", while a middle-aged white woman being killed is treated as news.

Original BLM activists never said ONLY black lives matter (to my knowledge). They were trying to call attention to a specific type of problem (cops killing black people without justification). That was their narrow focus.\n\nThe whole situation has devolved into a huge mess. Anybody can claim to be part of BLM, so there are people out there doing shitty things and giving the rest of them a bad name. It reminds me of  Occupy Wall Street. Not really any formal group structure or leadership, so the message gets lost and the members are mocked and marginalized. Additionally, some people don't believe the problem exists at all - e.g. the black people getting shot by police are doing something bad and shouldn't have put themselves in that situation in the first place."], [138, "I had an interesting interaction with the \"All Lives Matter\" crowd on my social media back when those officers were shot in Texas and Louisiana. Of course their response was to start posting \"Blue Lives Matter\" memes, changing their profile picture, etc.\n\nSo, one day I simply asked why officer's lives were more important than EMS, fire, or service members dying over seas/committing 22 suicides a day?\n\nThe response I got back was to the effect of \"Those are all very important, too. However, right now, the issue of cops being shot is more pressing since it's on everyone's minds and the news media.\"\n\nI then kind of retorted with \"hm...does any of this seem vaguely familiar to you guys?\", which fell on deaf ears. Not even the slightest hint of irony. One of the gentleman who responded was an actual county Sheriff. Not a deputy. The actual elected fucking Sheriff. It just did not compute that they were basically saying the same fucking shit. \n\nSo, I proceeded to pop open a bottle of Jameson and looked at flights to Tasmania. \n\n"], [365, "The house on fire is a good analogy. All houses 'matter', but if your house catches on fire, it requires immediate attention to help save it and the contents. It's not that the house is more important than the ones around it, it's simply the one most in need of attention. So when the firetrucks pull up and start to hose down that house, \"all lives matter\" is basically the neighbors nearby coming out and complaining that THEIR houses aren't getting equal attention."], [146, "I saw something, I believe on Reddit, but I can't exactly recall where. \n\nThe user said, \"It's like going to a breast cancer rally and saying \"All Cancers Matter\". Of course all cancers matter, but saying it at said rally isn't in good taste.\""], [46, "The basic premise of Black Lives Matter is the allegation (whether true or not) that society doesn't care about the lives of black people.  To conjure a garden variety example, if a black man is murdered (as happens with alarming frequency in Cincinnati, where I live), there's nary a headline at all.  If a white man is murdered, it makes headlines.\n\nThe more extreme - and provocative - example of \"society doesn't care about the lives of black people\" is the allegation (again, whether true or not) that police officers kill black men with impunity and without cause, and are not punished for it.\n\nSo that's the first part.  Their argument is that society values white lives more than black lives.  (Disclaimer: I'm Asian, so I see both sides - I've been discriminated against, but not to the degree the average black person is.)  Given the evidence (i.e. the disproportionate media coverage/public outcry, or lack thereof), the argument seems to carry merit.\n\n*****\n\nThe counter \"All lives matter\" is reviled because it doesn't actually counter the original assertion.  The phrase \"Black lives matter\" is truncated - what it should actually say is \"Black lives matter *too*.\"  Saying \"All lives matter\" is trying to contort the BLM message to say, \"Black lives matter *only*,\" which is not what BLM is trying to say.  It misinterprets what is a very serious and sober societal concern, and then dismisses it out of hand.\n\nIt's a combination of logical fallacies - it's an [appeal to the stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_lapidem) (dismissing an argument as absurd without actually countering it), an [irrelevant conclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi) (making an argument that, valid or not, doesn't address the issue at hand), and [Bulverism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulverism) (concluding an argument is wrong and then explaining why, instead of using evidence to make conclusions).\n\n*****\n\nIn a purely polarized world, \"All lives matter\" does nothing but inhibit the social reforms that BLM seeks.  Because racial discrimination does exist, and BLM seeks to remedy that, any attempts to counter them would, logically, be racist.\n\nHowever, the world is not purely polarized.  At best, \"All lives matter\" is a fallacious counterargument - answering a question to which BLM was not asking, and dismissing the question as answered.  At worst, it's a deliberate and intentional contortion of BLM's ideals to paint them as self-interested.  If I were to imagine motives for the latter (economic, capitalistic, societal, legal, legislative, electoral, or for law enforcement), any conscious twisting of the argument would be deliberately suppressing the black minority.  Whether it's to silence an inconvenient political group, to restrain a population segment's income so they buy your product, or just plain irrational hatred, deliberately suppressing a minority is racism.  I wager that *some* use of \"All lives matter\" is deliberate, while *most* is probably misinterpreting the conversation and using a logical fallacy as a result.\n\nI encourage you to read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/) (which has also been linked elsewhere in the thread) for another past discussion.  For my part, I agree with BLM's arguments and motives, but dislike the use of verbal and physical intimidation in their delivery.  Saying a white person can't champion their cause is still discrimination when there's no rational basis to support it (\"You're not one of us\" has limited, though sometimes valid, rational basis).

Of course all cancers matter, but that particular event is not about all cancers, it's about breast cancer.  Same kind of deal with black lives matter.\n\nJust trying to explain as best I can.

It is to bring attention to the fact that black people and other minorities are disproportionately and unfairly targeted by the police and is a form of discrimination. Saying \"all lives matter\", while certainly true, doesn't emphasize the issue of police brutality against the black community. It doesn't make you a racist to say \"all lives matter\", but it does distract from the purpose of the original phrase to point out discrimination. By bringing up the alternative of \"all lives matter\", it sends the message that you either wish to hide the plight of African Americans or outright deny it all together. So in some ways it's a marketing issue. If they started with \"all lives matter\" it wouldn't be connected to black people. If they decided to use \"only black lives matter\" or \"black lives matter too\" one would be racist and the other wouldn't really pack enough punch for a slogan. \"Black lives matter\" is strong and direct and nobody thinks that those who say the phrase are also implying other races don't matter.

Of course, all lives matter, but this is not the topic of conversation. By saying \"All lives matter\" you are not contributing to the discussion and are simply shutting up the ones who say \"Black lives matter\"\n\nFurthermore, it is also relevant to acknowledge that NOBODY went around saying \"All lives matter\" before \"Black lives matter\" became a thing. Mass shootings? War? Refugees? Nobody cared, but when it comes to race people immediately needed to defend themselves instead of engaging the problem.

Focusing on racism where it is not the key factor while ignoring everything else will not fix anything, and can only make things worse, as we are seeing with attacks on police and incidents like that female officer up North who got the shit kicked out of her because she didn't want to draw her firearm on a dude fucked out of his mind on angel dust because of the possible repercussions of using deadly force to her department and family."], [5, "Because it's assumed that life matters, and black people are routinely treated as though their lives don't matter (by police, the establishment, etc).\n\nThere's a \"too\" that goes unsaid at the end of BLM."]], [[{"comment": "This post has been locked because it is answered and has since devolved into uncivil arguments.", "id": "d8nq4qo"}], [{"comment": "This is the best explanation that I've seen yet from /u/GeekAesthete (https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/ct8pei1?st=iu5n8rcr&sh=b2a6d3af):\n\n> Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don't get any.

Almost every \"discussion\" I've seen on the matter comes down to someone saying \"black lives matters\", only to be followed with someone else saying \"all lives matter\". Then someone will say something like \"more white people are shot and killed by cops each year than black people\", and someone will respond to that with \"that's because there's significantly more white people\".\n> \n> A quick google search will reveal that 1146 Americans were shot and killed by cops last year. 306 were black, 586 were white [1]. With the population by race being 196,817,552 for white, 37,685,848 for black, the amount of people for each race, per 1 million people, comes out to 3.0 for white, and 8.2 for black. Since the rate is 3x higher for black people than white people, I can understand why black people are upset.\n> \n> However, we can look at this from another angle as well. Another source with similar numbers for 2015, has a chart that includes gender [2]. The numbers are not displayed, but I think it would be safe to say that fair guess for those shot in 2015, 50 were women, the rest (I'll use 1150 so not to give a number which implies it is exact) were men. With the population being 143,368,343 for women, and 138,053,563 for men, the amount of people for each gender, per 1 million people, come out to 8.3 for men, 0.3 for women. The rate is 28x higher for men than women, which is astounding! \n> \n> This begs the question, do those numbers mean that cops are sexist against men? As a male, should I feel worried about being shot by a cop? Should I trend #malelivesmatter? I don't feel it's necessary, because I can almost guarantee that if you were to ask any woman why they think these numbers are this way, the response will be something along the lines of, \"Because men do stupid shit.\"\n> \n> If the numbers are to be interpreted to say that cops are racist, then the exact same numbers can be interpreted to say that they are even more sexist. I don't feel that's the case, and so it is currently my opinion that an overwhelmingly number of people that are shot are due to the people putting themselves in that position, rather than race (or gender). \n> \n> Now, I realize that cops are not supposed to be the judge, jury, and executioner. But they are humans as well, and they want to go home at the end of the day just like everyone else. I also realize that cops make mistakes, or bad judgement calls, and sometimes are just flat out racist. Those are case by case issues though, and I would hope that they are dealt with accordingly.\n> \n> In the case of Crutcher, I don't see anyone mention how he walks what looks like 20 feet away from the cop towards the driver side of his vehicle, which was literally in the MIDDLE of the road. All anyone wants to say is that he had his hands up. Yes, he did have his hands up, until he didn't. By not complying with the police, he put himself in that position. By walking away, he put himself in that position. By putting his hands down, reaching for whatever, he put himself in that position. He made those decisions. It's easy after the fact to say that he was unarmed, and didn't deserve to die, but the cops didn't have that information at that point in time. Does anyone honestly believe that he had a death sentence from the moment the police arrived on scene? Out of all the videos of the recent shootings to be outraged over, I don't think I can get behind this one, until at least more information is released. \n> \n> I don't know the details for the guy who was shot while waiting for his kid, but from what I understand, that is one that people should (and are, with the 3 day protest) be outraged over. The one in Miami (shot, but not killed) people should be outraged over. There are plenty of other videos that people should be outraged over. But it's not because they are black, but rather, a person who was unjustified in being shot, which brings me to my final point.\n> \n> I believe I have shown that the numbers that are used to determine the level of racism are incorrectly used, since people put themselves in that position. The numbers that should be used are the ones where the people either (a) did not put themselves in that position, or (b), did not escalate the situation, which lead to them getting shot. I know of no such numbers, but would be interested to see them. Of course, those would be a subset of the numbers used here.\n> \n> --- Sources ---:\n>\n> [1] https://thinkprogress.org/heres-how-many-people-police-killed-in-2015-e9e78c890966#.w83s22wig\n> \n> [2] https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-map-us-police-killings\n\nI also later added the following correction:\n\n> I just realized I used 1150 for men, instead of 1100.

To conjure a garden variety example, if a black man is murdered (as happens with alarming frequency in Cincinnati, where I live), there's nary a headline at all.  If a white man is murdered, it makes headlines.\n\nThe more extreme - and provocative - example of \"society doesn't care about the lives of black people\" is the allegation (again, whether true or not) that police officers kill black men with impunity and without cause, and are not punished for it.\n\nSo that's the first part.  Their argument is that society values white lives more than black lives.  (Disclaimer: I'm Asian, so I see both sides - I've been discriminated against, but not to the degree the average black person is.)  Given the evidence (i.e. the disproportionate media coverage/public outcry, or lack thereof), the argument seems to carry merit.\n\n*****\n\nThe counter \"All lives matter\" is reviled because it doesn't actually counter the original assertion.  The phrase \"Black lives matter\" is truncated - what it should actually say is \"Black lives matter *too*.\"  Saying \"All lives matter\" is trying to contort the BLM message to say, \"Black lives matter *only*,\" which is not what BLM is trying to say.  It misinterprets what is a very serious and sober societal concern, and then dismisses it out of hand.\n\nIt's a combination of logical fallacies - it's an [appeal to the stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_lapidem) (dismissing an argument as absurd without actually countering it), an [irrelevant conclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi) (making an argument that, valid or not, doesn't address the issue at hand), and [Bulverism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulverism) (concluding an argument is wrong and then explaining why, instead of using evidence to make conclusions).\n\n*****\n\nIn a purely polarized world, \"All lives matter\" does nothing but inhibit the social reforms that BLM seeks.  Because racial discrimination does exist, and BLM seeks to remedy that, any attempts to counter them would, logically, be racist.\n\nHowever, the world is not purely polarized.  At best, \"All lives matter\" is a fallacious counterargument - answering a question to which BLM was not asking, and dismissing the question as answered.  At worst, it's a deliberate and intentional contortion of BLM's ideals to paint them as self-interested.  If I were to imagine motives for the latter (economic, capitalistic, societal, legal, legislative, electoral, or for law enforcement), any conscious twisting of the argument would be deliberately suppressing the black minority.  Whether it's to silence an inconvenient political group, to restrain a population segment's income so they buy your product, or just plain irrational hatred, deliberately suppressing a minority is racism.  I wager that *some* use of \"All lives matter\" is deliberate, while *most* is probably misinterpreting the conversation and using a logical fallacy as a result.\n\nI encourage you to read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/) (which has also been linked elsewhere in the thread) for another past discussion.  For my part, I agree with BLM's arguments and motives, but dislike the use of verbal and physical intimidation in their delivery.  Saying a white person can't champion their cause is still discrimination when there's no rational basis to support it (\"You're not one of us\" has limited, though sometimes valid, rational basis).

It makes it seem like that it's ONLY black suspects that are being shot at, when in reality there are a plethora of white victims of police brutality and other ethnicity as well. It's gotten to the point where recently a white female officer had completely refused to protect herself from a black male high on PCP simply because she didn't want to be drug through a media shitshow. Then so many martyrs that have been pushed to the causes forefront have always turned out to be the most prime examples of justified shooting victims. The most prime of examples being Michael Brown, where the protestors were completely waiting for a cop to be hung from the gallows days before the investigation even began. They had a completely dead set expectation and any other result was going to cause violence. Why not push Eric Garner's case to the forefront whom was 100% a leading example of police violence? He was simply a blip on the radar and simply vanished. \n\n  The movement was overthrown by overly extremist individuals the exact moment they started getting media coverage and completely turned into nothing more than a hate group. You can keep saying that it's bad people giving a good cause a bad name, but the problem is that those bad people are the cause now. They're the ones that have the media coverage and the most active movements and largest number of people present. \n\n To put it bluntly, it's not a black vs police problem that exists, it's a civilian vs police vs the media problem that exists. We need to stop letting the media completely turn every story into nothing more than mindless fear mongering and race baiting every time something happens. Then we need to simply strap a body camera to the officers and implement more non-violent training methods into their ranks at all turns. We also need to break the police union that has gotten way too bloated and powerful and establish a federal investigation board that provides oversight for any questionable actions taken.

If you want to downvote then be my guest, but you'd be doing us both a favor by leaving a reply instead. Let me also add that I was at one point the exact kind of person I'm about to describe. I'm not trying to belittle anyone, and I hold no ill-will towards anyone. I'm just voicing my perspective.\n\nEven though modern feminism and anti-racism have very little to do, if anything with equality (kill all men, \"why do white lives have value\", ect) the two movements just have such a deep history that the fact that one of them has abandoned egalitarianism is irrelevant. Communism loses a lot of credibility without giving lip service to progressive movements, and since most people see Communism as a failure, Communism *needs* credibility.\n\nSo that's one side of it. The other side is identity politics. (Quick reminder that this is my opinion and nothing more) A lot of people are more concerned with what other people see as their 'identity' or what groups they belong to than actual beliefs. Millennials will 'convert' to Islam despite not believing a word of the Koran, kids who have never had dysmorphia in their lives will suddenly come out as trans, and yes, ultra-consumerist Millennials with their phones and hair dyes and all the other frivolous luxuries they buy will become 'communists'. Why? These groups are seen as victims, and there's a comfort in victimhood. The oppression makes you out to be the good guy in all interactions, and the perceived lack of power means that other people bear the brunt of de-oppressing you. If they never do (and they usually won't) then you get to live your first world, privileged life while indefinitely using your victimhood as a fast-pass to moral superiority in all situations. Muslims are looked down on in the west, Trans people are often denied legal recognition, and Communists are seen as Machiavellian and evil. If you actually are one of these things, it's a shitty part of your life that you just have to deal with. If you just want to be right all the time, it's a great way of making sure that nobody can disagree with you without looking like a bigot.\n\nThe second part is that it's revolutionary, and everyone wants to be the next Che or Malcom X. In today's world where it seems harder and harder all the time to break class molds and make a name for yourself, where it seems like everything has basically been done and all our battles have been won, it's hard to become known for anything. Nobody does anything worth looking up to anymore, because there just isn't that much left to do until we find the next big breakthrough in human history. At least, it seems that way to a lot of people. But groups like feminism, BLM, and yes, Communism, tell people that there are battles left to fight, you do have the chance to make a name for yourself, you can be a hero. What's more, since in the modern world most of their goals have been met (don't start with me, Communists, if Marx saw the world today then he would at least say that worker rights and conditions have improved by a hell of a lot), there isn't actually a lot you have to do. Just say you are one, be sort of hostile to the people that the groups say you should dislike, and you're done. You don't need to protest or fight, because that was done decades ago. Women are legally equal to men, don't have to register for the draft, and when you compare like to like, get paid more than men. Black people are more likely to be hired and to be accepted into college. This isn't me whining that white men are oppressed (they aren't), it's just me saying that racism and sexism aren't they systemic issues they once were. The only remnants of them are social, and as much as it sucks, and as much as you want to get rid of it now, you just have to wait for that to die out with the previous generation.\n\nALL THAT TO SAY that being a feminist, anti-racist or communist is easy, but still makes you feel like a revolutionary. It still makes you feel special, important, and like you're on the right side of history. You don't risk anything, you don't have to do anything off of the internet, but you get to feel special. If internet communists were as serious as they say they are, they'd be catching planes to Syria to fight with communist militias, or to Turkey to protest with communists who actually have a chance of winning.\n\nAnd that's why so many communists are also feminists, from someone who was once a communist, and a feminist."]], [[{"comment": "To paraphrase the communist manifesto: shit doesn't just happen, it happens because someone is getting paid.\n\nThe idea is that sexism/misogyny was implemented as a system so women could be exploited for unpaid labor.

But no matter what form of institutional discrimination you look at, whether racism or homophobia or transphobia or plain old classism, you'll see a group not simply being treated badly, but being exploited for material gain.\n\nFor the record, you're entitled to your opinion about whether this is reasonable, or whether communism itself is reasonable. I'm not here to argue, I'm just reiterating arguments I have seen. ", "id": "d4k948e"}, {"comment": "Do you think true capitalism could work...Mr. capitalism? ", "id": "d4lrr3w"}], [{"comment": "Communism and social-rights movements have always gone hand in hand, and it's no different now.\n\nObjective answer over, entering the \"my opinion\" zone. If you want to downvote then be my guest, but you'd be doing us both a favor by leaving a reply instead. Let me also add that I was at one point the exact kind of person I'm about to describe. I'm not trying to belittle anyone, and I hold no ill-will towards anyone. I'm just voicing my perspective.\n\nEven though modern feminism and anti-racism have very little to do, if anything with equality (kill all men, \"why do white lives have value\", ect) the two movements just have such a deep history that the fact that one of them has abandoned egalitarianism is irrelevant. Communism loses a lot of credibility without giving lip service to progressive movements, and since most people see Communism as a failure, Communism *needs* credibility.\n\nSo that's one side of it. The other side is identity politics. (Quick reminder that this is my opinion and nothing more) A lot of people are more concerned with what other people see as their 'identity' or what groups they belong to than actual beliefs. Millennials will 'convert' to Islam despite not believing a word of the Koran, kids who have never had dysmorphia in their lives will suddenly come out as trans, and yes, ultra-consumerist Millennials with their phones and hair dyes and all the other frivolous luxuries they buy will become 'communists'. Why? These groups are seen as victims, and there's a comfort in victimhood. The oppression makes you out to be the good guy in all interactions, and the perceived lack of power means that other people bear the brunt of de-oppressing you. If they never do (and they usually won't) then you get to live your first world, privileged life while indefinitely using your victimhood as a fast-pass to moral superiority in all situations. Muslims are looked down on in the west, Trans people are often denied legal recognition, and Communists are seen as Machiavellian and evil. If you actually are one of these things, it's a shitty part of your life that you just have to deal with. If you just want to be right all the time, it's a great way of making sure that nobody can disagree with you without looking like a bigot.\n\nThe second part is that it's revolutionary, and everyone wants to be the next Che or Malcom X. In today's world where it seems harder and harder all the time to break class molds and make a name for yourself, where it seems like everything has basically been done and all our battles have been won, it's hard to become known for anything. Nobody does anything worth looking up to anymore, because there just isn't that much left to do until we find the next big breakthrough in human history. At least, it seems that way to a lot of people. But groups like feminism, BLM, and yes, Communism, tell people that there are battles left to fight, you do have the chance to make a name for yourself, you can be a hero. What's more, since in the modern world most of their goals have been met (don't start with me, Communists, if Marx saw the world today then he would at least say that worker rights and conditions have improved by a hell of a lot), there isn't actually a lot you have to do. Just say you are one, be sort of hostile to the people that the groups say you should dislike, and you're done. You don't need to protest or fight, because that was done decades ago. Women are legally equal to men, don't have to register for the draft, and when you compare like to like, get paid more than men. Black people are more likely to be hired and to be accepted into college. This isn't me whining that white men are oppressed (they aren't), it's just me saying that racism and sexism aren't they systemic issues they once were. The only remnants of them are social, and as much as it sucks, and as much as you want to get rid of it now, you just have to wait for that to die out with the previous generation.\n\nALL THAT TO SAY that being a feminist, anti-racist or communist is easy, but still makes you feel like a revolutionary. It still makes you feel special, important, and like you're on the right side of history. You don't risk anything, you don't have to do anything off of the internet, but you get to feel special. If internet communists were as serious as they say they are, they'd be catching planes to Syria to fight with communist militias, or to Turkey to protest with communists who actually have a chance of winning.\n\nAnd that's why so many communists are also feminists, from someone who was once a communist, and a feminist.", "id": "d4kip1g"}]]], "49rrnh": ["What makes The Division such a great game?", "2016-03-10 06:35:07", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/49rrnh/what_makes_the_division_such_a_great_game/", [[10, "I'm going to go ahead and say that the others here have it wrong.

Here's a bit of an explanation for that:\n\n**Spoilers**\n\nLast year in season 5, Jon became the leader of the Night's Watch, a military organisation that guards the northern-most border of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, mostly from roving bands of Wildlings - free people north of \"The Wall\" (that is a massive wall made of ice that acts as the northern border) that raid villages south of it, but more recently (and to the Watch's original purpose) magical creatures of ice called White Walkers.\n\nNow, the White Walkers have been known to raise the dead to build up their army, and are known to be heading south, so that's bad for everyone. Hearing of a large Wildling settlement between the Walkers and The Wall, Jon fears that the Walkers will slaughter and assimilate the thousands of Wildlings into their army. He leads an evacuation mission to bring as many Wildlings south of The Wall as possible.\n\nSince the Night's Watch and Wildlings were never on the best of terms, some high-ranking members of the Watch didn't like that Jon had let thousands of \"savages\" into the south, and had him murdered.\n\nNow in season 3 in an separate storyline, we were shown a Red Priest, named Thoros, resurrect a man after a duel. Thoros then meets a fellow Red Priestess, Melisandre, and tells her of his ability. So now everyone watching the show knows that resurrecting the dead is possible.\n\nThrough a series of events, Melisandre winds up in the same castle as Jon before his murder. In season 6, Jon's body is found by his friends and kept under guard from the traitors. One of his friends reaches out to Melisandre to try and use the magic associated with her religion to bring Jon back to life, since he is seen as a better leader for the Night's Watch. She succeeds and Jon is back. To the fans happiness, Jon proceeds to hang his murderers, one of which was a young boy who had previously killed Jon's Wildling girlfriend in a battle.\n\nAnother recent reason for a lot of Jon Snow talk, is his reunion with Sansa Stark, his \"half-sister\" (but more likely cousin if a fan theory turns out to be true), after not seeing each other for years in the show's timeline, and the first episode of season 1. Now Sansa and Jon are of a noble family, and their home has been taken from them by an evil fellow named Ramsay Bolton. He sent a detailed threatening letter to Jon, and Jon seems to have decided to go to war. This particular war has been long awaited by fans, and has been dubbed \"Bastard-Bowl\" on account of both Jon and Ramsay being bastards.\n\n**TL;DR** - a lot of interesting and exciting stuff surrounds the character of Jon Snow.", "id": "d3ax81m"}, {"comment": "I don't watch the show but I thought Peter Dinklage's character was the most well-liked?
