With a semi-erect or fully erect penis, stretch the cock ring a bit, so that the top of the ring is wider than the bottom. Slide it over the head of the penis, while simultaneously stretching the bottom half underneath the head. Slowly but surely slide the ring down the shaft of your penis, making sure not to catch any stray pubic hairs. Roll it down the penis, or you can hold it stretched out until you reach the bottom of the shaft.  Once down at the base of your penis, release your hands from the cock, and see how the pressure feels. If you have a cock ring that is intended to be placed underneath the scrotum, stretch the top half over your penis, and then, the bottom half over your testicles. If you have a cock ring that is intended for just below the head, you can just snap it on at the same time. When in doubt, lube, lube, lube. Lube is magical and never underestimate its powers, especially when using sex toys. My suggestion would be to use water-based so it doesn\u2019t end up eating your toy and causing damage.\n\n[Source](http://persephonemagazine.com/2012/10/the-cock-and-balls-of-it-using-cock-rings-for-the-first-time/)", "id": "cyeh97q"}, {"comment": "They have different ones, mine goes around the balls and shaft which applies a really nice pressure, even more so whilst high as it gives you like a hyper awareness of it. 10/10 would recommend.

Weed is going to be a $20 billion industry shortly and only climb from there.\n\nFrom a consumer standpoint, regulated large grows are a boon. Cannabis is a weed - there's a legitimate question about why (under a legal framework) it should cost much more than some really good produce or tobacco. \n\nWill that hurt small growers? In the short term, probably.

Virtually all the No on Prop 64 content we've seen in this subreddit has been from growers, dealers and dispensary owners/workers.\n\nAt this point, growers and some cannabis workers are trying to suggest we wait for a better legalization law in the future.  But that's exactly what the growers were saying last time.  And like as not, in 4 years or 8, there's no guarantee the next initiative will meet with their approval.  As a matter of a fact, it seems almost certain they will reject it then, too, since they are committed to the current system and don't want to change.  So we're really just playing a game of kick the can down the road.\n\nI'm not at all concerned with putting illegal growers and dealers out of work.  I regard that as a plus, and the new law allocates money for repairing ecological damage from illegal grows, which is another plus.  I'm more concerned about the effect on existing MMJ workers, and sympathetic, but I'm not convinced things are going to be as bad as some fear.\n\nAnd regardless, more importantly, I think it's necessary to look at the bigger picture here.  Legalization benefits all Californian cannabis users, and offers them legal protection from incarceration, penalties, and potential loss of employment and property.  Those real benefits outweigh the possible cost.  Californians aren't responsible for maintaining the current cannabis business model.\n\nOne argument I hear often is \"but under the current system, anyone can get a medical card\".  And yet, they shouldn't have to, and many don't.  Lots of people don't want to get put on a list, others feel it's distasteful to have to fake an illness.  California still arrests 8000 people a year for possession.\n\nAnother important part of the new law is homegrow.  That's going to be huge, and a great way for Californians, especially low income Californians, to save money.  Even a lot of people who purchase most of their smoke are going to want to grow at home.  \n\nAll in all, I don't see much of substantial difference between Prop 64 and the laws in the legal states.", "id": "d8eln3p"}, {"comment": "Have you read the Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and Oregon legislation? They are all completely different with their policies of possession and growing, especially when it comes to the definition of personal use vs. commercial production. \n\nAs for penalties, yes, they will be decreased as long as you follow the guidelines, which are more stringent than what they currently are in CA. imo that's not really the legalization we want and deserve.\n\nWhat's worse is that if prop 64 passes, and all of a sudden a few months/years later the feds decide to deschedule or fully legalize, then stipulations under prop 64 will still be in place for CA. \n\n", "id": "d8em3sz"}, {"comment": "I've read the Alaska legislation.  Just the Ballotpedia summaries for the others.  I know Washington doesn't allow homegrow, which I think is quite ridiculous.\n\nThere are some problems with the new laws. For instance, 6 plants are 6 plants, but if you harvest those plants, you're going to end up with more than 1 oz in possession.  At some point in the future, states are going to have to address this discrepancy.\n\nMy feeling is that the laws aren't set in stone. In most cases, I think it's best to just legalize now, and try to fine tune things later.  The only recent case where I think it was best to not vote for legalization was in Ohio last year, where a cabal of 10 investors tried to write themselves into law as the only growers.\n\nI'm not against Big Cannabis.

Indoor grown cannabis was the same price as outdoor cannabis... $3/gram. People financed by millionaires didn't mind that they were making the bare minimum because all they had to do was wait for everyone else to tap out. After the first crop many of my customers were bought out. Legalization creates a monopoly for the mega rich who could give a single shit about growing cannabis properly and with love. \n\nDid you hear about the huge farm in Colorado that was using Eagle 20 on it's crops?

Actually, legalization will most certainly provide better access. Also, you won't need a doctor's recommendation.  The only MMJ patients this might negatively affect are low income patients.  But that's an issue that can be addressed by the legislature, and shouldn't affect legalization.\n\n* Leaves felony penalties in place for most marijuana offenses\n\nWell...sure.  Just like in the other legal states, you can smoke, possess, transport and grow.  But you can't grow more than 6 plants, or sell without a license, or engage in trafficking.  And you can't drive under the influence, etc.  So, yeah, all those things remain felonies.\n\n* Could destroy Arizona's smoke shops\n\nIf smoke shops want to participate in the retail system, they can apply for a license.  Arizonan residents aren't responsible for ensuring these smoke shops can maintain their current business model.  It's more important that all Arizonans get the right to smoke without risking incarceration, penalties, and loss of employment and property.\n\n* Only includes \"fake\" marijuana grow rights\n\nLooking at the ballot summary, it seems pretty straightforward.  You have the right to grow 6 plants for personal use.  I really don't know what he's on about here.\n\n* Gives the Arizona medical dispensaries an oligopoly on the entire marijuana market\n\nThe new law gives \"reorganized\" marijuana businesses license review priority.  So if dispensaries want to apply for a new retail license, they can do so, and their applications will be reviewed beginning in September, 2017.  New business applications will be reviewed beginning in December 2017.  \n\n* Allows your employer to fire you for using marijuana, even if the marijuana was used legally in your own home\n\nFirst, Arizona is an at-will state, so employers can fire you for any reason they want, at any time.  But as regards drug testing, yes, they can still do that, too, just like in all the other legal states. Hell, some employers test for tobacco, because they get lower insurance rates. If you try to wait for a legalization initiative that prohibits/limits drug testing for marijuana, you're going to have to wait for federal legalization.

This department has the power to enforce the regulations of the new industry, after they are ratified by legislature. The officials who will inspect cultivation, manufacturing and retail facilities for compliance are called \"enforcement officers\" in the text of Prop 205.  But that doesn't mean they're carrying guns.  They're carrying clipboards.  They could just as easily have been called regulation inspectors.  Calling them police would be like calling health inspectors police.  They aren't going to come banging on your door in the night like a bunch of jackbooted thugs.\n\n-\n\nThis is all scare tactics, and it's cherry picking.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nBallot summary:  https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Marijuana_Legalization,_Proposition_205_(2016)"], [5, "jesus fuck, and I thought the lies and scaremongering by the remaIN campaign was bad, this is just straight up lying and scummy as fuck."], [2, "Honestly just kinda confused right now "], [2, "The way this is written... my god... am I supposed to take this shit seriously?

Actually, legalization will most certainly provide better access. Also, you won't need a doctor's recommendation.  The only MMJ patients this might negatively affect are low income patients.  But that's an issue that can be addressed by the legislature, and shouldn't affect legalization.\n\n* Leaves felony penalties in place for most marijuana offenses\n\nWell...sure.  Just like in the other legal states, you can smoke, possess, transport and grow.  But you can't grow more than 6 plants, or sell without a license, or engage in trafficking.  And you can't drive under the influence, etc.  So, yeah, all those things remain felonies.\n\n* Could destroy Arizona's smoke shops\n\nIf smoke shops want to participate in the retail system, they can apply for a license.  Arizonan residents aren't responsible for ensuring these smoke shops can maintain their current business model.  It's more important that all Arizonans get the right to smoke without risking incarceration, penalties, and loss of employment and property.\n\n* Only includes \"fake\" marijuana grow rights\n\nLooking at the ballot summary, it seems pretty straightforward.  You have the right to grow 6 plants for personal use.  I really don't know what he's on about here.\n\n* Gives the Arizona medical dispensaries an oligopoly on the entire marijuana market\n\nThe new law gives \"reorganized\" marijuana businesses license review priority.  So if dispensaries want to apply for a new retail license, they can do so, and their applications will be reviewed beginning in September, 2017.

Just like with alcohol, where every city or county retains the right to become a dry city or county, every municipality has the right to prohibit retail cultivation and/or manufacturing.\n\nThe prevalent wisdom is that you can't pass a legalization initiative without offering the local option to opt out.  If you try, the opposition will seize upon that and shout about the state oppressing local communities, and they will win.\n\nSo basically, any town can vote to ban retail sales or commercial grow ops.  This just means residents have to drive farther to make purchases, and the city misses out on its share of cannabis tax revenues.\n\nIt doesn't affect the legal protections under the new law. All residents still have the rights to smoke, possess, transport, grow, etc.  The city can't ban you from growing in your residence for personal use.\n\nedit:  Looking at the bill, it appears local government does have the ability to ban outdoor cultivation.

If you know how easy we already have it, why would you vote for a half measure?  I currently can choose from one of many dispensaries, although I grow my own.  If this law passes, it further restricts my cultivation rights.  \nI remember being in a comedy club after close with about 50 people, most of whom were frients.  It was in 2012, just after the Colorado and Washington votes.  One friend was lamenting to me that California should have been the first to legalize.  I told him we didn't, because it was already de facto legal here.  He disagreed, so I stood up and asked the room if anyone had known someone who was arrested for weed.  No one.  I asked if anyone knew of someone even getting a ticket.  One person had a friend who got a ticket. It was from Border Patrol at an illegal immigrant checkpoint.  It was from a federal agent.  \nWe already have legalization in all but name.  I understand that many of the ents on this sub are from places where weed is highly illegal, and I sound crazy, and that legalization is a dream come true for them; that is because they don't understand what it is already like here.  My local police already give you your pot back if its less than an ounce and you say you have a medical card.  You don't even have to have one.  You can just say you do.  They don't want the hassle if you'd just show up to court with your rec.  It seems like a bad move to vote to have legalization in name when all it will serve to do is further restrict ourselves.  \n", "id": "d4swgwc"}]]], "48fbr4": ["1.5g keef firecracker and some brownies for a ski trip", "2016-03-01 11:39:12", 0, "http://imgur.com/BpkAZqO", [[7, "Did you really eat kief?"], [2, "Wtf is going on here?

It's not something that spirals out of control 100% of time, and it's hard for me to relate to someone  who thinks it will based on their own problems with it... much less take their advice.\n\nI get that you're trying to be helpful though... but I think if you really want to get through to people, maybe realize that you aren't some wise \"ex-addict-guru\" who smoked a bunch of grass and felt like they lowered the quality of life, but just another person with your own set of problems.  Sure, taking a break from weed once in a while is a great thing, and if someone wants to get sober that's awesome for them.  It's like when I talk to a Christian about religion- I can totally get all their points about their beliefs but as SOON as they tell me that one day when I've had more life experience I'll agree with them I stop relating.  I hope this hasn't come off as too angsty, just feel like this reads as someone who thinks they have seen and know more than others- which I'm sure wasn't your intention.  \n\nIn short, while it's good to encourage others not to fry their brains, not everyone who smokes weed will have the same problems you do.  Not everyone hates themselves because they smoked a lot of dope as a kid.  Not everyone experiments with LSD and shrooms a few times and feels like they fucked themselves up.  I hope people benefit from what you have to say, but I think you'll reach more people when you bring yourself back down to Earth and realize just because you've had these problems with weed doesn't mean that weed will always do the same thing to others.", "id": "d5gioqf"}], [{"comment": "Any advice on smoking in college?

As we take the puffs and pass it around for a second time, we have stopped coughing as much, but still our throats are sore.\n\nNow, we are stoned and thirsty.

I lived off campus, so it was very helpful to have some friends living off campus as well that were a short walk from the dining commons. They would do two things in their free time - smoke & watch TV / Movies. As it was 2006-2007ish, there were loads of options on cable for Reality TV, and as they had exhausted their DVD collection, there was oft 'Flavor of Love', or 'Shot at Love' when I came over to smoke with them. I was more of a Super Nintendo and smoke person, which we occasionally did as well. Handing off controllers on Super Mario or Tetris, nothing exotic. But the reality TV cycle, lots of heated debates over who was the best candidate for whom and why, which new series might be any good to watch, how awful some episodes are as nothing is actually happening... good times.  \n\nOnce, after a particularly bad episode, they seemed upset that they had wasted time they could have been using on more productive activities. It sparked a debate on what's worth the time and what you could do instead, finding shorter and shorter chores to do, especially during commercials. I like pushups or walking around for forty five seconds, anything to not watch. Well, about a week after this debate, moments after welcoming me in, they tell me that they have a trick to show me. Worried this was a prank at my expense, I was relieved to see them try a few clumsy two-person yoga positions. Nothing fancy like the acro-yoga that's gaining momentum right now, and from what little I know of the standard asanas, not yoga at all. They were finding fun ways on commercial breaks to push and pull against each other to hold themselves partially off the ground or upside down giving them silly names like Falcons Free, The Shopping Cart or The Love Boat. Positions with fun names got practiced more and became quick, go to moves. \"What will happen on the next date?-\" Mute the TV, Love Boat, TA DAAA, take a rip.  \n\nThis post made me nostalgic for those times, and it made me feel like perhaps other people, commercial avoiding or not, are doing the same thing.

I sell vapes so I have customer feedback too. I'll tell you why I almost always suggest the Arizers over the Pax. (Not even touching on the fact that the Arizers are at least $100 cheaper)\n\n\n- metal chamber and tubing. Why to fuck would you make a high end vape with metal tubing and chamber. It tastes much worse than glass (yes I have used a Pax) and maintains heat too well. The vapor doesn't cool down and therefore is much less smooth. The Arizer has glass tubing and glass is the only thing my heated bud touches.\n\n\n-maintenance. Again, the metal tubing and mouth pieces and chamber of the pax are much harder to clean. I  clean my pipes once a week and STILL found the pax to be so much more maintenance. I've had many customer complaints about cleaning the Pax. It's not that it's hard to clean, I get that, but it's MORE work than the glass whip of the Solo which I submerge in soaking cleaner with my pipes. Done.\n\n\n-Quality. I've had so many more customer complain about issues with the Pax than Arizers. I'm not saying Arizers don't break, every brand has the occasional lemon. I'm not saying a Pax will absolutely break either, I have a coworker who has had one for years with no complaints. But the Pax 1 did have occasional mouthpiece issues, especially in the cold. And again, Ive had more Pax complaints than Arizer. However, Pax has a very long warranty period 10-15 years. While the Solo has 2 years. So warranty win for Pax.\n\nEssentially, I find the Pax to be the iPhone of Vapes. Its not that its bad. It's just not what I feel to equal quality to price. Their warranty is exceptional though. The one larger downside I feel the Arizers have is being less portable due to the straight glass tube. \n\n\nEdit: formatting ", "id": "d8xdr7t"}, {"comment": "portable by definition, but not discreet at all. mine has been collecting dust since I got the pax.", "id": "d8x6cw8"}, {"comment": "Have you seen the arizer air?

Nonetheless, research on this topic is scarce and often shows conflicting results, with some studies showing detrimental effects of marijuana use on cognitive functioning and others showing no significant long-term effects. The purpose of the present study was to examine the associations of marijuana use with changes in intellectual performance in two longitudinal studies of adolescent twins (n = 789 and n = 2,277). We used a quasiexperimental approach to adjust for participants\u2019 family background characteristics and genetic propensities, helping us to assess the causal nature of any potential associations. Standardized measures of intelligence were administered at ages 9\u201312 y, before marijuana involvement, and again at ages 17\u201320 y. Marijuana use was self-reported at the time of each cognitive assessment as well as during the intervening period. Marijuana users had lower test scores relative to nonusers and showed a significant decline in crystallized intelligence between preadolescence and late adolescence. However, there was no evidence of a dose\u2013response relationship between frequency of use and intelligence quotient (IQ) change. Furthermore, marijuana-using twins failed to show significantly greater IQ decline relative to their abstinent siblings. Evidence from these two samples suggests that observed declines in measured IQ may not be a direct result of marijuana exposure but rather attributable to familial factors that underlie both marijuana initiation and low intellectual attainment.
