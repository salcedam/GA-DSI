Would've been better if she addressed it off stage agreed. I understand how this kind of thing can be incredibly distracting and annoying to someone performing. There was a great article from someone on Broadway who wrote about how much they deal with it. I guess I still just don't get how people get so angry about what usually amounts to YouTube videos. Unless you're afraid of making less money with your own promotional videos and dvds, I just think these people should let it go or deal with it subtly to avoid doing anything personal. The person recording could have possibly been someone doing it without malicious intent. Maybe it's an honest mistake that that person will relive for the rest of their life. They just wanted to get some footage for their blog and they aren't familiar with what camera they could legally use. Unlikely but it happens.

Second, apparently the whole conversation centered around what desert to make, and the contest winner was obviously browbeaten into making Cradock's choice of desert, which turned out to be a complete failure in execution, and that apparently annoyed the viewing public who felt that Cradock had ruined this lady's otherwise-perfect dinner.

Honestly feel the whole cartoonishly-bombastic *Trump* caricature-thing has all been political theater to essentially polarize the masses and award Hillary the presidency by acting as foil toward the general public. The Clinton's have SUCH a shady and criminal past (like the Bush's) and Hillary has been within the system learning who to glad-hand, who to keep, who to kill, what is a threat to her trajectory and what is benign. And Trump has his own past of similar (but different) sketchiness. I feel that the true powers that be have already selected their president, and it's just up to the theatrics of the remainder of the election to play out so the people can feel as though they \"at least chose the lesser of two evils\", All of the legitimate/decent/good candidates were intentionally weeded out and favorites were played by the conglomerate corporately fascist news media organizations. I may be wrong, but it's what my instinct has been pointing towards since Bernie/Rand and or any potential Third Party candidate had been snubbed, all in order to allow the playing out of what we are and will continue to see. \n\nThat's why it's important that we as a people learn to unite, for we are far more similar than we are different, no matter what the TELEVISION tells you. It's the media and the corporations that have EVERYTHING to gain by you being afraid of your fellow men and women of humanity. And yet, we are WAY more powerful when We The People, ARE **WE**, TOGETHER, and not buying into the \"Us and Them\" false narrative that has driven so much of our society as of late. They are afraid of our true power, which is why The Powers That Be do whatever they can to keep us stupid, docile, subservient, and trusting that they have things taken care of, when it's we that need to be doing so. And then you add the fuel of the individuals insecurities in themselves and their fears of societal change, the increasingly militaristic behavior of law enforcement, as well as the total disregard for Truth. For information is power. Both the withholding of and the revelation of it can be used to serve specific needs.

Reports of hate crimes have actually been fairly steady for a decade now, and the number of active hate groups has actually fallen over the past few years.

Trump and Fox news are all morons, certainly. But they are not responsible for any perceived increase in racial tension. You know who is responsible for this perception? Whining liberal college students who see racism, sexism, and every other ism around every corner. They are very vocal about how everything a conservative does is racist. \n\n>I think it's there and the only people who deny it are white conservatives.\n>\n\nAnd people who actually care about facts. But hey, you can think what you want. It doesn't mean you're right. I'm a pretty left leaning individual, and will call someone out for racism in a hot minute. But this idea that we as a country are getting worse with racism is flat out false. \n\n>and I like how he got out of people's politically correct comfort zone and kept it real by addressing america's real history of racism, and slavery.\n>\n\n\"America's real history of racism, and slavery\"? What does this even mean? Nobody is denying the history of racism and slavery in this country. Nobody. The the truth is that things have gotten much better since then, and are getting better all the time. \n\nLarry Wilmore is a funny writer, but he's a hack of a comedian. His delivery sucks.

Of course there could be social safety nets, but they wouldn't be what made it socialist.\n\n\nAnyhow, it's interesting how differently Europeans and Americans define socialism. In much of Western and Northern Europe, social safety nets, universal education and healthcare aren't even a left-right issue.

Not an engineer but I've worked in studios since 1999.  This video riled me up and I'm about to write a huge paragraph about it.  Kelli's attitude is completely professional, open-minded and collaborative.  What bothered me about this section of the video is that it seems obvious this is the first time that the volume level of the click track was adjusted from the board in the control room.  There is no way Moby was paying for this session to essentially create a song in a studio whilst being filmed.  It was a very prissy move and the whole way he handled it was typically Moby...pretentious and pedantic.  This whole idea of an engineer being paid to shut up and record is absolutely ridiculous.  The incredible amount of talent it takes to run a multi-channel SSL board is absolutely massive and it is very obvious that this engineer is no rube.  When Moby was having his hissy fit he didn't let the engineer finish.  What the engineer was trying to tell Moby was that Moby would have the ability to adjust the isolated click track via his multi-channel headphone amp at his side.  I mean it would be one thing if it was some crucial guitar solo or something super delicate where any headphone bleed would screw with the take but during that bass section...seriously?  It was this typical behavior that I have personally witnessed many times when famous people have an audience and need to show everyone who's da boss.  \n\nIf you are going to get so de-railed while tracking such a basic bass part then you really should leave the job to a session player.  I've found that the most skilled and most respected players always finish the track and then make adjustments i.e. \"Why was the click track level raised?  I'd like it softer for the next take...can you send that channel to my headphone amp so I can adjust it on my end?  Cool.\"  That dramatic hand waving and tone of voice only used by this type of ego maniac drive me mad.  This is the same man who got \"electrocuted\" then handed his guitar to a servant, jumped off a four foot stage, and then collapsed.  He is a damn drama queen.  I have worked with people like him on all levels...be it an unknown rocker or a multi-platinum diva...shut the hell up and bring some humility to the table...you're a guest in this studio and you are not creating anything legendary or monumental...it's a fun little experiment and you have a whole damn team of people trying to make everything go well.  I can only imagine what it is like dealing with this man on a daily basis.  I see people like this all over L.A. constantly lecturing and being defended by that age old piece of b.s.: \"Well, at least he's being direct and honest\" as if that excuses diva-behaviour.

Colbert lacks warmth and can come off as being aloof in a lot of his interviews.  He is much more comfortable in the satirical realm where he can shape things to his comedic style.  His monologues are fine, but his interviews lack tone and humanness.  While Fallon gets a certain amount of hate on reddit for whatever reason, he at least has the ability to help the audience view guests through a certain lens, which makes the interview much more digestible if you can get past the laughs.
