I'm 50% deaf (my right ear is entirely disabled). I'm currently 14, I've went through the whole child-deafness (there was a period where I was teaching myself sign language, but I decided to stick with lip-reading and it was the right choice for me - ASL is probably the right choice for your daughter). \n\nI don't have a lot of resources to offer, but if you ever have any questions, I'd be willing to answer them!\n\n_________\n\nThis is a list of some of my experiences as a young child who was partially deaf - I hope you'll take this to heart and make choices where this is relevant. I'm probably going to say for every one that it's the best thing to ever happen - they're all incredible. It's insane how much a few little things (and a few big things) can make a difference.\n\n1. Speech therapy - the best thing to ever happen. If your daughter ever gets made fun of for speech therapy (which (and I'm referring to speech therapy here) is an absolute must), then go into school and talk to her teacher. Explain, in no uncertain terms, that the bully(ies) need to be dealt with. Speech therapy is, again, **imperative.** I cannot stress this enough to you.\n\n2. Find somewhere or someone that can help teach your daughter lipreading. She'll figure it out over time, but just a bit of professional help will be amazing. One of my friends' mother is 80% deaf, and teaches deaf children. She talked to me for about an hour about lipreading one time, and it was almost as helpful as speech therapy. Half of what I \"hear\" is really what I see.\n\n3. Read with your daughter. Read with her a lot. Get two copies of every book you read with her, and have her follow a long in the second copy of the book. Having a mental and physical representation of sounds is so important. If not for my parents doing this with me, I can guarantee you I would be a stuttering, insecure shell of a child. **PLEASE READ WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. I BEG YOU.** READ OUT LOUD. I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS ORIGINALLY.\n\n4. Never, ever make a joke about her deafness. Ever.\n\nOkay, not literally never. You'll know when it might be O.K., but it won't be until at least middle school. Every joke your daughter hears about deafness from people close to her will just make it worse on her. I'd say that the first time she makes a joke about her deafness is around when it might start being okay to do.\n\nThe good thing is, none of this is very expensive. 2 was a lucky hit for me, but you can probably meet someone at a deaf group who can help her with that (typically, half-hearing people rely a lot on lip-reading to fill in the blanks). Even if you have to make photocopies of book pages, though, that's soo important. I was *literally* reading before I was talking, and that honestly probably saved my life. I still think in words rather than sounds (visuals of pages rather than words, if that makes any sense). Your daughter will love the bonding time (Dr. Seuss is an incredible writer, just saying) and you probably will too.\n\nThere should be a speech therapist at most public elementary schools.\n\n______________\n\nOnce again, PLEASE do not hesitate to ask any questions if/when you have them. I've only ever known one other person who had partial deafness (and she attempted suicide because of how much she was made fun of for it). I don't know if your daughter will go to a public or a private school, but if she is going to a private school, make sure to have her interact with fully-hearing people on a regular basis. Even if she can't talk *well,* it's important that she can at least get her point across without ASL decently.", "id": "d8wtn0q"}, {"comment": "Jesus christ.

Here's a [great overview](http://www.mammal.org.uk/sites/default/files/Domestic%20Cat%20Predation%20on%20Wildlife.pdf) by the mammal society about the effects of domestic predation by felines. And [here's](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Beckerman/publication/228733612_Urban_bird_declines_and_the_fear_of_cats/links/00b7d5184732726dfb000000.pdf) a lovely population modeling survey of the non direct predation effects of felines on avian urban populations! Urban areas, by the way, harbor about [20%](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/not-just-sparrows-and-pigeons-cities-harbor-20-percent-of-worlds-bird-species/) of all avian species!\n\nAnd the issue isn't even that mass cats cause huge conservation problems. The often cited example for this is Tibbles the lighthouse cat. Tibbles was brought to Stephans Island, a small island off the coast of New Zealand, by his owner, the lighthouse keeper, in 1894. Tibbles proceeded to single handily drive the Stephans Island Wren to extinction about a year after his arrival. The problem is that cats are not often subsistence predators, and house cats or pets are even less so. The problem is so large that a famous conservationist, John Wamsley, wears the pelt of a feral cat to ceremonies he's invited to as a way to send a message. \n\nI'm not saying that your cat doesn't need to go outside.

The often cited example for this is Tibbles the lighthouse cat. Tibbles was brought to Stephans Island, a small island off the coast of New Zealand, by his owner, the lighthouse keeper, in 1894. Tibbles proceeded to single handily drive the Stephans Island Wren to extinction about a year after his arrival. The problem is that cats are not often subsistence predators, and house cats or pets are even less so. The problem is so large that a famous conservationist, John Wamsley, wears the pelt of a feral cat to ceremonies he's invited to as a way to send a message. \n\nI'm not saying that your cat doesn't need to go outside.

My son quickly set about destroying every illusion I had about being a good parent. He cried so much that my neighbors called the police. He had some sort of sensory issue that caused him to be hyper sensitive and overreactive to everything. Sometimes he would cry for an hour and we'd try everything you try as a normal parent, only to do something like remove his socks and have him suddenly go silent.

In that darkest moment, I understood why people kill their children. That's horrible to say, I know, but that was my thought. Not that I wanted to kill mine, but I suddenly understood how people could become so overwhelmed that they just snapped. I got up and put him on the floor, with him still screaming, and went to the bathroom to get myself together.\n\nHumorously enough, once we got past the infant stage, my son became my \"easy\" child. My daughter, however, became the child who destroys everything she touches. She put vaseline on her bedroom wall, she poured comet on the kitchen floor so they could \"skate\", she poured a whole bottle of lotion on herself, she cut her own hair.

It is a myth that dairy causes more mucus or phlegm...\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=milk+mucus&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C6\n  \n  \nOne Abstract\n> There is a belief among some members of the public that the consumption of milk and dairy products increases the production of mucus in the respiratory system. Therefore, some who believe in this effect renounce drinking milk. According to Australian studies, subjects perceived some parameters of mucus production to change after consumption of milk and soy-based beverages, but these effects were not specific to cows\u2019 milk because the soy-based milk drink with similar sensory characteristics produced the same changes. In individuals inoculated with the common cold virus, milk intake was not associated with increased nasal secretions, symptoms of cough, nose symptoms or congestion. Nevertheless, individuals who believe in the mucus and milk theory report more respiratory symptoms after drinking milk. In some types of alternative medicine, people with bronchial asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the lower respiratory tract, are advised not to eat so-called mucus-forming foods, especially all kinds of dairy products. According to different investigations the consumption of milk does not seem to exacerbate the symptoms of asthma and a relationship between milk consumption and the occurrence of asthma cannot be established. However, there are a few cases documented in which people with a cow\u2019s milk allergy presented with asthma-like symptoms.\n\nSource - http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2005.10719503\n\nAnother Abstract\n> In the first of three studies investigating the widely held belief that \u201cmilk produces mucus,\u201d 60 volunteers were challenged with rhinovirus-2, and daily respiratory symptoms and milk and dairy product intake records were kept over a 10-day period. Nasal secretion weights were obtained by weighing tissues collected and sealed immediately after use. Information was obtained on 51 subjects, yielding 510 person-days of observation. Subjects consumed zero to 11 glasses of milk per day (mean, 2.7; SE, 0.08), and secretion weights ranged from zero to 30.4 g/day (mean, 1.1; SE, 0.1). in response to an initial questionnaire, 27.5% reported the practice of reducing intake of milk or dairy products with a cold or named milk or dairy products as bad for colds. Of the latter group, 80% stated the reason as \u201cproducing more mucus/phlegm.\u201d Milk and dairy product intake was not associated with an increase in upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms of congestion or nasal secretion weight. A trend was observed for cough, when present, to be loose with increasing milk and dairy product intake; however, this effect was not statistically significant at the 5% level. Those who believe \u201cmilk makes mucus\u201d or reduce milk intake with colds reported significantly more cough and congestion symptoms, but they did not produce higher levels of nasal secretions. We conclude that no statistically significant overall association can be detected between milk and dairy product intake and symptoms of mucus production in healthy adults, either asymptomatic or symptomatic, with rhinovirus infection.\n\nSource - http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/ajrccm/141.2.352?journalCode=arrd#.VqHQ-V7gX0o", "id": "cz7jc0p"}, {"comment": "I've always heard that dairy makes phlegm thicker and harder to cough up.", "id": "cz7jpnl"}, {"comment": "I dunno about anyone else, but for me it certainly *feels* thicker after I drink milk.

I think it's been shown repeatedly over the last decade that \"Khajit\" was the patron god of vendors, closely related to the god of currency, \"Doge.\" Although scholars are still unclear as to why domesticated animals were associated with capitalist ventures, nor why, despite the apparent approval of capitalism throughout that era, these animal deitys are shown to speak in poor mannerisms. (although Professor Lee does argue convincingly in *The meme as the source of authority* (Hawaii  University press, 2344) that the rich routinely spoke like that to mock the lower classes and show they can say whatever they want by examining the presidencies of 2016 and 2020, where it became increasingly common for the powerful to openly speak in stupid mannerisms, again, likely to flout their power).

I, myself almost believe in the sociological power of memes. They did, after all, get 3 presidents elected, in 2016, 2020, and again in 2040. I'd classify them as a faith since they are a source of secondary compensation.\n\n(primary compensation is what you get by working and earning money, or taking medicine when sick, secondary compensation is what you get when you pray for a sick person, or meme about a presidential candidate.

What is happening right now? Nothing at all. Yet the leaves rustle, the grass sways, the birds call, the gnats dance. All of this is just a part of the world. If you become a part of the world, you become nothing at all. You become invisible. If you are not part of the world, the world becomes ten thousand things. This is misfortune.\n\nIt is easy enough to become invisible if you stay still, if you hide. But staying still and hiding aren't enough to catch prey. You must seek and strive. How do you seek and strive while remaining an ordinary part of the world? How do you exert your will without disrupting the world? How do you move along with the will of the world? This is the mystery of hunting. This is the mystery of subtlety.\n\nThis is the greatest of all mysteries.\n\nConsider the mouse. It is moving through the leaves, looking for food. You must not disturb it. Do as little as possible. Wait. Watch and listen. If it moves away, move with it. Follow it. If it moves closer, stay still. Practice non-interference. Let it come. It should be thinking happy thoughts of food and comfort when you strike. When you snare it in your claws, do not eat it right at once. Let it struggle and give up its lifeblood. Practice non-action. You need not kill it. Let it die.\n\nTo be subtle is to move with the will of the world. Do not move against the will of the world. This brings misfortune. Touch lightly the course of things without disturbing it. Touch it gently at points of inflection, and it will move as you wish. This brings great fortune.\n\nThis is the ancient Art of Subtlety, taught to us by our form. I must follow it if I am to find any answers to the mystery of the Oily Ones, the mystery which has obsessed me since the death of my kitten. I must know why they both feed us and kill us, why they are kind and motherly but also unnatural and abominable.\n\nI have decided that I will go into one of their hiding places. After much investigation, I have chosen a place. It is a very large and horrible hiding place, a sort of mountain of box-like shapes colored by unnatural light. It emits a powerful and unholy odor of decadence. What is more, there is something which makes it different from all other oily places I have ever seen.\n\n It seems that some of our kind live within this place. I have seen them from a distance, going in and out of it, using small portals. They are different than those of our kind that I have known. It seems that some of the Oily Ones' corruption has mutated them. They are very fat and slow. Their faces are stupid and sullen. They fear nothing. They have lost subtlety. I am not even sure they are truly of our kind.\n\nI will go inside. I must be subtle. To be subtle, I must become a part of the world. I may have to become a part of the abomination itself. I may find death, bloody death as my kitten did. But I will hunt to the heart of this mystery. And I will sleep again.\n", "id": "d38fejn"}, {"comment": "Here I was, minding my own business, reading a Khajiit repost.\n\nSuddenly, it is 12 hours later, and I feel weird after reading through everything.", "id": "d38xe27"}, {"comment": "Nah, this is an apartment building or house.\n\nNice parallels you can draw to drug culture and to the primary point of existence of Mother.", "id": "d38if2p"}, {"comment": "A laboratory breeding animals for experiments?", "id": "d38fk21"}, {"comment": "Check out /r/9m9h9e9/ The author has been posting parts of some weird narrative for the last few weeks and some of us are trying to figure it out.", "id": "d38g26s"}, {"comment": "Holy shit, I thought that I reddit too much but I haven't seen this one yet.\n\nI better up my ante", "id": "d389x3z"}, {"comment": "I had the same reaction when I recently heard the [Steve Buscemi firefighter TIL](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/search?q=steve+buscemi+firefighter&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)", "id": "d38bwtg"}, {"comment": "Just wait until you hear about Christopher Lee!

This dog is naturally equipped to do irrevocable damage to that infant as a matter of circumstance, without exhibiting even the slightest trace of malice or aggression. Accidents happen in an instant. Replace the pit bull with a toddler holding the baby and standing on top of a ten foot ladder. It might be cute, but there is so much potential for catastrophe.

Amazing. I used to be involved in these, but chose not to show steers because it's too big of a money game.  ", "id": "d34bvbw"}, {"comment": "So I've been out of the industry for a while, and some of the nomenclature might have changed, but here's a bit of a follow up.\n\nThere are two different types of stock shows for beef cattle, Purebred and feeder shows. Purebred shows are all about the breed. These animals will end up going into breeding programs to produce the next generation. A high quality bull can go on to sire hundreds of calves over his life time, thousands if AI is used. High quality brood cows and heifers can be sold for big money cow-calf producers (the people who breed the animals that end up in feed lots) who are looking to boost the over all quality of their own herd. This type of show is where you'll see the high end national competition, with professional breeders. Moreover, breed associations maintain databases of all registered pure bred animals going back generations. This can be useful for identifying genetic performance (or abnormalities) along certain lines. This has lead to the development of breed specific genetic performance values call EPDs. These show are important promotional events for seed stock breeders to promote their operations, and to gauge the quality of their product against their competitors. There are cross bred show for breeding animals, but they tend to be less common, and more regional. \n\nThere is a genetic phenomenon know as heterosis (also called F1 vigor or Hiybird vigor) that occurs in the first generation of cross between two pure bred lines, in which the population average of calves of hybrid origin will out preform the population average of the same generation of pure bred animals. Hiybird vigor diminishes over generations, so the F1 cross sees the most value add. So if your a cow calf producer looking to raise high quality offspring for the feed lots, there is an incentive to cross breeds. Additionally you want to make sure your crossing the best of those two breeds. The competition that comes form these shows, and inbteween the breeds drive a constant improvement in available genetics for the industry. The seed stock producers job is produce these high quality pure lines, for the cow calf producer to cross. \n\nFed cattle shows focus on animals that have been fed for slaughter. These animals are often (but not always) cross bred (because of the boost from heterosis) and are are at an age and weight appropriate for slaughter. These animals are almost always steers (castrated bulls, so no breeding potential) under two years of age. Sometimes these animals will be auctioned off at the end of the show (for slaughter), sometimes the animals will be on a show circuit and compete in several competitions for prize money (some times made up from entry fees, sometimes sponsored by industry promoters). These competitions are called Jackpot Shows. Due to the prize money on the line, Jackpot shows can be very competitive. These shows are important because they represent the best of the best that the beef industry as a whole can produce. They represent what the optimal animal exiting a feed lot can look like. \n\nAs far as which is the \"Highest level of competition,\" I would say that that is hugely debatable. The level of prestige shifts based upon the breed and the region. For example, in the PNW, stock shows are largely for 4-H and FFA, and there are relatively few Jackpot shows. Most of the high level competition is in pure bred. In say, Texas and Oklahoma (and the midwest in general) Jackpot shows are a much bigger deal. \n\nIf you're talking about total potential return though, I would say purebred bull competitions are where the biggest money is at. Due to the breeding potential of AI, a national champion pure bred bull can easily value 6-7 figures.\n", "id": "d34koxq"}, {"comment": "Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, annually, has some of the most impressive bovine I've ever seen.\n\nThe chili cook off doesn't suck either.
