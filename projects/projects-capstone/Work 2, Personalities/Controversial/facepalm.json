In fact many of them are arguably refugees fleeing the brutal drug war.  Are some of them criminals? Sure, but Trump's comments and yours unfairly paint the entire group of people as dangerous based on the activities of a small percentage.

You have been brainwashed to believe that garbage. What I do is refuse to turn a blind eye to the horrific crimes that are committed by people who come to this country illegally and I acknowledge that by taking a stand against illegal immigration this country can make great progress in lowering the occurrence of those crimes.\n\nAs for radical Muslims immigrating from high-risk countries, again you have been brainwashed to believe something that isn't true. I have worked with a lot of Muslims in my life here in America and they all respected the most fundamental aspect of American society which is freedom. What the progressive left seems to want to do is ignore whether or not an immigrant from a high-risk country accepts western values and simply trust that they will be good people while ignoring the fact that ISIS said that they will infiltrate refugee programs so that they can carry out attacks against those who do not share their ideology. The OSU psychopath carried out his attack two days after ISIS called for attacks in the west. As for the registry, again you have been misled to believe something that isn't true. The registry would be the same registry that was already in place up until I believe 2013, maybe 2011, which did not track people based on a religion but tracked people based on the country they are coming from. A Christian coming from Syria would be put on the registry, a Muslim coming from Japan would not. \n\nAs for Breitbart, show me how they are anti-Semitic. The only article I have seen the left-wing media try to spin to be anti-Semitic was a pro-Israel article written by a Jew (they tried to spin the title of the article but never bothered to mention what the article was actually about).

Your views on Breitbart is just another example of how you have been misled to believe something that isn't true. \n\nAs for the Mississippi church, do you honestly think that a Trump supporter did that?

First of all, my boss is a vicious tyrant who gets off on the petty torments he puts me through day in and day out, and I'm too spineless to stand up to him, so I just take it and I've gradually come to hate myself for it.

We lost our daughter last year to one of the bitterest, coldest winters we've ever had to face in this region. Isn't it funny, doc, how all the prayer circles and charity drives in the world amount to pretty much nothing in the face of that cold, impartial face of winter, that bleak, pounding, harsh fist of a callous environment, carrying on with its machinations without regard to our lives, loves, hopes and dreams? Isn't that hysterical, Doc? Oh and then there's my son. Doc, I don't love him anymore. I don't know what it is but I look in his eyes and I see that same harried look of gutless cowardice that I see when I stare at my own face in the mirror. If I wasn't such a coward, Doc, I know I'd be able to scrape together enough pride to grab that cocked and loaded shotgun I keep by the bedside table, and just run amok and put an end to this grim facade once and for all. I start with the wife, then the boy of course before putting the barrell in my own mouth. Believe you me, Doc, I'd be doing the world a favor. I have nothing to look forward to but a continuation of this spiraling black hole that is my life, this existential cesspool that is the perpetuation of my lingering skid-mark on society. I despise people yet I crave their approval. I'm judgemental yet I care about nothing. I'm bitter, hateful and afraid. I'm alive yet I feel like the walking dead.

It would be like going cold turkey off of oil. \n\nFrom an anthropological standpoint:\n\nOur entire lifeway and our population distribution is predicated on intensive agriculture, including livestock. The concept of an urban city center (that exceeds carrying capacity of the environment by orders of magnitude) supported by vast hinterlands is a story that is as old as as domesticated crops and animals. It enhances natural trade and craft specialization, which is why it prevailed over pastoralism and horticulturalism in all but the most marginal environments.  You suggest not only giving up not only meat but everything from cheese to honey? On what sort of time frame? Until technology can provide a plug and play solution for the wants and needs of urban centers that is more efficient than the status quo, it won't come to pass. Regardless of anyone's moral qualms.\n\nOn my own personal, cultural level:\n\nI need cheese bro. I could go without meat, I'd be unhappy but I could do it. You don't understand the role cheese plays in my life. Moreover, while I need cheese *culturally*, I need factory milk and factory eggs *logistically*. My diet, which is already low in red meat for economic reasons, wholly depends on not only the protein, but its role in cooking everything from my pancakes to my nutrition shakes. I won't be giving up dairy with any choice in the matter. Soy milk doesn't replace it. \n\nOn a radical environmentalist level:\n\nYou want make a difference? Ban outdoor cats. Peoples' pet cats that are allowed to roam do untold damage on local bird and wildlife populations. Protect fisheries. Not save the whales, not blackfish, but ugly little millet and cod and whitefish and whatever.  Not nearly as sexy but I promise you'll have a greater impact than trying to sell large scale veganism to a population that cannot structurally adapt to it at this time. \n\nSorry to come at you a bit aggressive, it's a bit pent up I guess from all the things I had to hear from a hardcore vegan chick I used to fuck with. And I'm awful tired of constant appeals to emotion when my goddamned undergrad is anthropology and my goddamned concentration is hunter gatherer archaeology. BUT. But. At the end of the day you won't change my mind and I won't change yours. And it doesn't matter who is right and who is wrong.

Additionally, the people who have the most to gain from discussion and debate are typically the non-participating listeners, and more than a few of my own views have changed over time in this way. Now on to your points: \n\n1. Cold turkey: You're correct in saying that instantaneous change of that magnitude would cripple the planet, but that's not going to happen anyway. It's a gradual process, but it only continues so long as the number of people making ethical choices continues to grow, which is why I at least put forth some effort to discuss the issue with people, even though it usually just ends on ridicule.\n\n2. Ag efficiency: Our lifestyle may be predicated on intensive agriculture including livestock, just as it used to be predicated on the systematic enslavement of an entire race, but we can get by just fine without the livestock, and FAR more efficiently. The amount of water and land required per pound of beef as compared with consumption of the crops directly is somewhere around 10-12 times  greater.\n\n3. Cheese: I wholeheartedly believe you when you say you wouldn't voluntarily give up cheese simply because of the taste, and I believe serial killers when they say they can't resist murdering people. The only big difference between the two is that they have a mental illness causing them to enjoy an action, while you simply enjoy a byproduct of an action, which is actually significantly worse. I don't mean to cause offense by this, but as a mental exercise you could try replacing eating cheese with raping children (the analogy is even more accurate when you consider that cows being artificially raped is necessary for dairy production, and both nonhuman animals and young children are unable to defend themselves). If valuing your personal pleasure over the wellbeing of others doesn't strike you as selfish and unethical in either situation, then you need to consider seeking professional help. \nP.S: There are also lots of good vegan cheeses! I'll be the first to admit that vegan versions of animal products very rarely taste just as good as or better than the real thing, but it's a very small sacrifice when put into perspective.\n\n4. Protein: Judging by how articulate your comment was, you're clearly very intelligent. You know as well as I do that your diet does not \"need\" eggs and dairy for protein. Literally millions of people live perfectly healthy lives on vegan diets, including many elite athletes. A good friend of mine is vegan and a power lifter, he can bench press 405lbs. I'm not worried about our protein.\n\n5. Economics: If your diet is already low in red meat due to economic reasons, just think how much better off you'd be financially going vegan? The cheapest and most abundant foodstuffs in the world are all vegan, animal products are primarily a first world privilege. Organizations working to end global starvation, such as OxFam, send exclusively vegan food, not out of any concern for the morality of animal agriculture but simply because it's the most economically efficient way to feed people.\n\n6. Pet cats: You're actually right about that, but working with or donating to a kitten rescue or your local humane society to help spay and neuter cats reduces the stray population immensely, as well as not supporting breeders. I would encourage everyone to adopt an animal in need from a shelter rather than funding horrible and probably illegal breeding operations.", "id": "d5bpmc2"}, {"comment": "You saw a report about the practice, and now you've become a bit of a propagandist claiming it's an industry norm. \n\nThe norm is to use it as fertilizer, and most jurisdictions require that it be injected. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgJffvPNt-o\n\nDamn shame you've gotten so many upvotes for such hyperbolic  commentary.

I'd rather see a world where it is a universal truth that black people have equal opportunities to white people, and where the race card is no longer a valid play.\n\nIt seems that, because of the historic importance of white-on-black racism, that we currently live in a world where some people cannot speak their minds, or express their feelings, without being judged as racist. I fear that the very same feelings and thoughts could be freely aired by someone else with a different skin colour, which in and of itself is a racist position, in my opinion.\n\nHow is it just when one person can behave in certain ways, say certain things, be accepted with certain views while another person cannot, with the only difference being the amount of melatonin in their skin? We need to be over this now, and move forward united as a human family.\n\nI do not think it is enough for everyone to agree that 'yeah, let's be friends'. We need to fully address the causes of issues that do exist, and at the same time put the brakes on the matter of issues being raised where they do not.\n\nI would start in the US, where some cities are pretty divided along geographical lines, with one part of the city predominantly white and relatively affluent, and the other part predominantly black and poor. It may not be planned segregation, but it takes an astounding level of ignorance to claim that this is not segregation at all. My solution would be to develop the poorer neighbourhoods, giving priority to local people while attracting others from further afield, in the hopes of raising the living standards for families already there, and also mix populations a little more. The richer white families would want better local education, so investment would happen, but the primary beneficiaries would be the pre-existing black population, leading to better opportunities for them. Meanwhile, the mixing of communities would encourage better understanding of one another, and therefore less actual racism."], [8, "I have no clue what I'm looking at"], [7, "Ah yes, when blacks systematically lynched whites and burned crosses in their yards... definitely happened.

I'd rather see a world where it is a universal truth that black people have equal opportunities to white people, and where the race card is no longer a valid play.\n\nIt seems that, because of the historic importance of white-on-black racism, that we currently live in a world where some people cannot speak their minds, or express their feelings, without being judged as racist. I fear that the very same feelings and thoughts could be freely aired by someone else with a different skin colour, which in and of itself is a racist position, in my opinion.\n\nHow is it just when one person can behave in certain ways, say certain things, be accepted with certain views while another person cannot, with the only difference being the amount of melatonin in their skin? We need to be over this now, and move forward united as a human family.\n\nI do not think it is enough for everyone to agree that 'yeah, let's be friends'. We need to fully address the causes of issues that do exist, and at the same time put the brakes on the matter of issues being raised where they do not.\n\nI would start in the US, where some cities are pretty divided along geographical lines, with one part of the city predominantly white and relatively affluent, and the other part predominantly black and poor. It may not be planned segregation, but it takes an astounding level of ignorance to claim that this is not segregation at all. My solution would be to develop the poorer neighbourhoods, giving priority to local people while attracting others from further afield, in the hopes of raising the living standards for families already there, and also mix populations a little more. The richer white families would want better local education, so investment would happen, but the primary beneficiaries would be the pre-existing black population, leading to better opportunities for them.

The actual army name for it is olive drab green reinforcement tape which is what you would need to call it if you were to order it from the army supply store (GSA).\n\n\n\n>The story goes that during WWII the army asked Johnson & Johnson to develop a seal that would keep moisture out of their ammo cans.  J&J answered with OD green reinforcement tape.  It is said that the tape was so effective at keeping moisture out that water would bead off it like \"water off a duck's back\" earning it the name \"duck tape\".  Duck tape would end up having multiple uses in the military, though; with supply short during WWII, duck tape became the military's answer to fixing equipment in the field.   Seeing how effective, efficient, and versatile a roll the tape played in the military, J&J marketed the tape to civilians as a fix all.  The tape became known as \"duct tape\", but I'm not sure if this is because the most common usage was to hold ducts together or because civilians misheard the name.\n\n\n\n>Throughout the history of the military, supply was always an issue, and in the event that GI's didn't have the proper tools to fix something they would use duck tape.  As a fix all, duck tape was so effective that it was said it could hold a jeep together travelling at 100 mph, hence the common army name \"100 mile an hour tape.\"  Ask anyone from the army what it is and they'll tell you.\n\n\n\n>100 mile an hour tape is a part of army (military) lifestyle so much that it is actually documented for usage in SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures).  From personal experience, I can tell you that it is used per procedure for preparing slingload operations (operations where a helicopter carries something beneath it) and to cover shiny objects and reduce noise (rattling) when on patrols.\n\n\n---\n\n_Soldier 1:  Tie down that flap on the trailer before we lose another gas can._\n\n_Soldier 2:  Can't, the tie down strap is broke.

After all, if the state owns all the capital and thus gets to dictate the price of that capital, then they get to effectively dictate the wages being offered to workers.  If renting out the means of production to workers is exploitative, then all that has happened by giving the government ownership of the means of production is that they're doing the exploiting.  Except now it really is exploitation, because rather than society as a whole collectively bidding up or down the price of those means, now it's one central authority deciding the price arbitrarily.\n\nFurthermore, where does new capital come from in this society?  And out of whose wages are the savings taken to create this capital?  More arbitrary decisions from the planning authority, more reasons to claim that worker A's wages should be higher or lower regardless of his output.\n\nThe state can claim that their decisions on who gets paid what will reflect the idea that those who provide more and better labor will be rewarded more highly.  But there is no guarantee in place, no recourse to the laborer if the state changes its mind.  In fact, without market mechanisms, it's difficult to even judge what constitutes more and better labor.  The state could very well decide to equalize the outcomes among everybody.\n\nOf course, when it comes down to it, Bernie Sanders probably isn't interested in the state seizing the means of production.  So that isn't the starting point from which a defense needs to be made.  Then again, he very plainly is planning to redistribute income from high income earners to low income earners.  As president he would increase taxes on the higher income brackets and use the revenue to increase transfer payments to the lower income brackets.\n\nThe Facebook friends of OP's might be exaggerating and classroom grades are a flawed analogy, but they have the general picture.

Socialism at its core simply means that workers have control of the means of production. How they get there is what varies.\n\nIn one branch, yes you can have the government take over. However there is a rather important stipulation: A government taking control of the economy and controlling the means of production can only be socialism insofar as the workers have control over the government. If the workers truly do control the government, then the government taking control over the means of production is equivalent to the workers themselves taking control over the means of production. However, as everyone should be well aware, many (if not all) attempts at this have resulted in rampant corruption and the complete destruction of virtually all socialist principles, like in the USSR.\n\nAn alternate route is independent of the government action route. Instead of workers reclaiming the means of production through their government, they do it on a business by business level. Each factory, each company, each building, however you want to imagine the units of the economy being broken apart, those are then taken by the laborers at each of those units. The hierarchy of control is broken down, and the labor that the boss used to do is distributed into the labor force. The workers figure out a way to distribute power amongst themselves and still make decisions, but most envision this being a democratic share of control using weekly/bi-weekly meetings to make command decisions about the direction of the business. In other words, basically the purest form of a horizontal business structure.\n\nYet a third route is the least intrusive method on a current system, however it often gets blasted for not being a truer form of socialism. The goal of reclaiming the means of production is to bring back to the workers the surplus of wealth generation that the boss and the power hierarchy of a business generally feeds off of. If a worker can, in the abstract, create $25 worth of value in an hour of work, they can't be paid $25 if the boss and the rest of the hierarchy are to make a profit.  They must be paid less than that. So instead of reclaiming the means of production, one can instead reclaim this surplus to a sufficient degree that it assures for a good and minimal standard of living (things like universal health care) that can't be taken away by the hierarchy of power within a business.\n\nSocialism is different from a state-planned economy. There have been states that have called themselves socialist in the past which have been state planned, as a mass appeal to workers makes for a damn great claim to legitimacy. However, there are also state-planned capitalistic systems, especially in east Asian capitalism which is diverging substantially from the normal western view of capitalism.", "id": "cz0e5v2"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cz0fvaw"}, {"comment": "It's still not because wealth is different from a grade on a test.

Secondly, this doesn't take false allegations into account which, whether we want to believe it or not, are an actual thing that happens a lot more frequently than many would like to admit. This info graphic assumes that every single reported case is 100% true, which is an absolute lie. They are not guilty because they are accused. And finally, this info graphic assumes that every rapist only rapes once, which is astronomically false. Most rapists are repeat offenders. You cannot use simple subtraction to determine how many rapists walk free each year. That's impossible to know. This whole thing is just loaded with false claims and impossibilities. \n\n\n\nEdit: Yes, I realize it says sexually assault and not rape.

We cannot say that someone was raped or sexually assaulted unless the accused has been found guilty in a court of law.

Were they given specific questions about specific situations, or were they simply asked if they had been assaulted? Because, depending on who you ask, someone accidentally grazing your bum with their hand as they walk past is sexual assault. According to many, having consensual sex after 2  or so drinks is rape, despite the fact that the law says it isn't. Without an actual criminal proceeding,  we have absolutely no way of knowing what the participants actually considered assault, what was considered assault in the survey, and if it actually matches legal criteria. In one study (I wanna say the Mary Koss study where we get the 1/4 women statistic), having any sexual contact while consuming any amount of alcohol constituted rape, which is asinine. For all of these reasons, no one should ever take it at face value that someone was assaulted just because they say they were.

Your example of a chicken eating a worm is a bit indicative of the disconnect -- it only doesn't evoke an emotional response because we give little-to-no moral consideration to worms.\n\nLions eat humans.  (~250 deaths annually)  There isn't a significant moral responsibility to prevent humans world-wide from being eaten by lions, though.  It's accurate to say \"someone is killed and eaten by lions on most days.\"  Yet none of this says anything about the moral worth of ending human lives, and it similarly wouldn't justify taking a human life for any reason.  The natural reality of the situation... well, it is whatever it is... and that has nothing to do with morality.  You and I, we're humans.\n\nActs committed by humans have a higher standard because we're capable of understanding right from wrong.  For the same reason it's wrong to abuse animals (\"It's wrong to cause unnecessary suffering and death.\"), it should equally be wrong to eat them.", "id": "d10br6q"}, {"comment": "Plants are alive too, and fully aware of their surroundings. Why is a chicken any more morally wrong to eat than broccoli? The chicken was bred and fed and kept to be food, otherwise it wouldn't even exist. Like I said, the moral issues here for me is how they are raised and bred, not the fact that we kill them for food. It's just an issue of repurposing your natural empathy for other humans and pets because you can see similar qualities in a chicken. But having some threshold for the complexity of life before you find it morally wrong to kill them for a purpose is completely arbitrary to me. Either it's wrong to take a life in all circumstances, or its morally justified to kill for food. Whether it is a plant or a spider or a worm or a chicken, cuteness should not be the deciding factor of whether it is okay to kill them or not.", "id": "d10tv4s"}, {"comment": "People start buying less eggs and less chicken => producers breed less hens using artificial insemination => continue to match decrease in demand => Finally, they aren't bred anymore => Most likely the farmer decides to kill the remaining ones to sell their bodies.\n\n\nThe roosters from which the sperm is collected will know the same fate.

Hell, a huge chunk of the world's population is from countries that are traditionally Buddhist/Hindu. It's not even that unlikely that at some point in the past 25% or something of the world was vegetarian. But the idea that 100% of the world would give up eatting chicken and eggs so that there were no more chicken farms? That is completely a pipe dream. You can't bake much or even make good pasta without eggs.  \n\nAs for chickens, I kept them growing up. If you need to find it online feel free to search, I doubt anyone will argue that roosters don't kill each other. Hell, a lot of them are so aggressive they will even kill the hens when they are mating them or attack a grown adult when you are feeding them. Even though farmers select for the least aggressive ones, it is still super rare to find even two of them that will get along even if they grew up together. And the ones that do get along will most likely die to a more aggressive alpha one rather than gang up on him properly. Any farm that has a bunch of roosters keeps them all in separate cages. If you spend time with chickens you will learn that they are really dumb assholes that modern technology still cannot prevent from pooping up into their own water feeders. Their existence pretty much depends on humans to keep them alive, as they have been bred to be more docile, less intelligent, and less athletic than their wild jungle fowl cousins over thousands of years.

Before the event parents holding little kids were told this. They lost it! Arguing and yelling, saying not fair etc. So the organizers, volunteers, gave up and let these parents with tiny kids line up. The other parents, off to the side, as a group, got mad and started cussing and grumbling. But things held tight and the hunt was counted down. 10-9-8-7-6-5 bam! some parents with the little ones thought they'd get a head start on the pack of older kids. The countdown never made it to 3 as all hell broke loose. Still not a crisis but controlled chaos. Until... one parent tried to stake a small area for his twin toddlers to 'find' eggs. Of course kids are running everywhere for eggs and jackass ends up holding out arms to stop the kids. That was it. The sideline parents rushed the field to 'help' their children. What a disaster. Parents were at each other's throats. I'm not exaggerating a bit. \nMy friend and his kids just weren't prepared and his kids were too scared to even line up.

My son is 6. I asked him to please run to the trees (which were about 15 feet away) before picking up eggs. That way, the little kids could get some. He and his buddy both ran to the trees first and then got a bunch. Most of the kids weren't in a big rush, and it took a little time for them to get all the eggs. Right at the starting line, there were about 10 eggs that all the kids had somehow skipped over. A kid who was about 3 was very timid and didn't want to leave his mom's side. We talked to him a little about the eggs and told him he could go pick some up and put him in his basket. It took about 5 minutes, but he finally wandered over and picked up a few. It was nice. All the kids had a good time, and then they gave out little packages of goodies (hard-boiled eggs, jelly beans, and tooth brushes) to all the kids on their way out to make sure every kid got something.", "id": "d1ersyh"}, {"comment": "> Like are you really that desperate as a parent that you need to take away from another kids good time.\n\nYep, people are self absorbed assholes quite often unfortunately.

Before the event parents holding little kids were told this. They lost it! Arguing and yelling, saying not fair etc. So the organizers, volunteers, gave up and let these parents with tiny kids line up.

The countdown never made it to 3 as all hell broke loose. Still not a crisis but controlled chaos. Until... one parent tried to stake a small area for his twin toddlers to 'find' eggs. Of course kids are running everywhere for eggs and jackass ends up holding out arms to stop the kids. That was it. The sideline parents rushed the field to 'help' their children. What a disaster. Parents were at each other's throats. I'm not exaggerating a bit. \nMy friend and his kids just weren't prepared and his kids were too scared to even line up.

It usually includes a combination of vacuum aspiration, dilation and curettage (D&C), and the use of surgical instruments (such as forceps).\n\nAn ultrasound is done before a D&E to determine the size of the uterus and the number of weeks of the pregnancy.\n\nA device called a cervical (osmotic) dilator is often inserted in the cervix 24 hours before the procedure to help slowly open (dilate) the cervix. Dilating the cervix reduces the risk of any injury to the cervix during the procedure. Misoprostol may also be given several hours before surgery. This medicine can help soften the cervix.\n\nD&E usually takes 30 minutes. It is usually done in a hospital but does not require an overnight stay. It can also be done at a clinic where doctors are specially trained to perform abortion. During a D&E procedure, your doctor will:\n\nGive you a first dose of antibiotic to prevent infection.\nPosition you on the exam table in the same position used for a pelvic exam, with your feet on stirrups while lying on your back.\nInsert a speculum into the vagina.\nClean the vagina and cervix with an antiseptic solution.\nGive you a pain medicine injection in the cervical area (paracervical block) along with a sedative. If the procedure is done in an operating room, you could receive a spinal anesthesia injection into the fluid around the spinal cord. This numbs the area between your legs. Or your doctor may use general anesthesia, which makes you unconscious.\nGrasp the cervix with an instrument to hold the uterus in place.\nDilate the cervical canal with probes of increasing size. An abortion in the second 12 weeks will need the cervix to be dilated more than required for a vacuum aspiration.\nPass a hollow tube (cannula) into the uterus. The cannula is attached by tubing to a bottle and a pump that provides a gentle vacuum to remove tissue in the uterus. Some cramping is felt during the rest of the procedure.\nPass a grasping instrument (forceps) into the uterus to grasp larger pieces of tissue. This is more likely in pregnancies of 16 weeks or more and is done before the uterine lining is scraped with a curette.\nUse a curved instrument (curette) to gently scrape the lining of the uterus and remove tissue in the uterus.\nUse suction. This may be done as a final step to make sure the uterine contents are completely removed.\nGive you a medicine to reduce the amount of bleeding from the procedure.\nThe uterine tissue removed during the D&E is examined to make sure that all of the tissue was removed and the abortion is complete.\n\nDoctors may use ultrasound during the D&E procedure to confirm that all of the tissue has been removed and the pregnancy has ended.\n\n**End**\n\nWhere in that does it mention cutting anything?", "id": "d92pex1"}, {"comment": "As someone who actually works in the medical field, but specifically as a N.P. to an Ob/gyn, there is an important detail that everyone seems to be missing, including Wikipedia.  \n\nPretty much a late term abortion can't be performed unless the fetus is already confirmed dead in most cases (if you want me to explain more what the line there is I can).  This is due to the partial-birth abortion ban act of 2003 which actually would offer the physician removing the live fetus in the manner seen in OP's picture a few years of jail time.  This law was even upheld in the Supreme Court by Gonzales v carhart in 2007.\n\nTo get around this, physicians must use what is called a feticide to first kill the baby before extracting it.

Discusting."], [3, "Actually it might be indicative of a lead in voter enthusiasm among Trump voters vs. Clinton voters, which would actually be very important in the outcome of an election. \n\nThe challenge that get-out-the-vote efforts constantly face is that election day voting (which is the day most people vote) is a massive inconvenience. Poll lines can take hours to get through. You have to register to vote and have an understanding of how the process works. And most people are fully aware that their vote will quite literally not matter in the slightest. \n\nSo how do you get people to vote? Mainly, through a sense of community (or, for the cynical among us, peer pressure). Mail campaigns that \"threaten\" to expose one's failure to perform their civic duty to their neighbors are much more effective at getting people to vote than appeals to them personally as a citizen. On the flip side, if you can create a sense that an individual is part of a larger, meaningful movement by voting, that can also be effective in driving turnout, even though the person still knows in the back of their mind that their individual vote will not meaningfully contribute to the outcome. \n\nHow does this relate to Facebook and polls? One thing that I think has been criminally underexamined in this election cycle has been \"shy voters\" and  enthusiasm on the part of Trump's supporters.\n\n Donald Trump received 5 million more primary votes than any other candidate in the party's history. He routinely draws 15-20,000 people to his rallies. This isn't happening in a vacuum. These people are going back to their communities and advocating for Trump. Driving through Ohio this weekend, I must have seen two dozen Trump/Pence signs. Clinton signs? Four or five.\n\nFacebook is a similar animal. The vitriol and ridicule that Trump gets from articles produced by the journalist intelligentsia are nonstop, and these articles frequently are shared on Facebook. Speaking for my own friends list, FB is an \"unsafe space\" for Trump supporters. I suspect that's the case for many other people. Yet Trump still has that many likes. Why is that the case?\n\nNow, on to polls. In case you weren't aware, polls are not just calling random people and tallying what they think. There is detailed methodology and weighting applied to the raw results. In many cases, the sample of voters is weighted to the turnout demographics  of the 2012 election. As anyone with half a brain is aware, these are not anywhere near the same circumstances.\n\nWhat pollsters are failing to account for IMO is the level of Trump enthusiasm that is motivating people who have not voted for years, if ever. Pretending like the electorate is going to vote the same way it did in 2012 (\"balancing\" the results accordingly) given the results of the campaign so far is idiotic and arrogant at best. At worst? I wouldn't be surprised if pollsters are intentionally weighting polls to craft a narrative that Trumps campaign is in freefall and can't make up the gap. \n\nThat's just my takeaway. Believe what you will. But ask yourself: do you think this election will have the same kind of turnout as 2012, when an incumbent president ran against a conventional politician? \n\nDo some digging and you might find this election is a LOT closer than you're being led to believe.

Discusting.", "id": "d8uiia8"}], [{"comment": "Actually it might be indicative of a lead in voter enthusiasm among Trump voters vs. Clinton voters, which would actually be very important in the outcome of an election. \n\nThe challenge that get-out-the-vote efforts constantly face is that election day voting (which is the day most people vote) is a massive inconvenience. Poll lines can take hours to get through. You have to register to vote and have an understanding of how the process works. And most people are fully aware that their vote will quite literally not matter in the slightest. \n\nSo how do you get people to vote? Mainly, through a sense of community (or, for the cynical among us, peer pressure). Mail campaigns that \"threaten\" to expose one's failure to perform their civic duty to their neighbors are much more effective at getting people to vote than appeals to them personally as a citizen. On the flip side, if you can create a sense that an individual is part of a larger, meaningful movement by voting, that can also be effective in driving turnout, even though the person still knows in the back of their mind that their individual vote will not meaningfully contribute to the outcome. \n\nHow does this relate to Facebook and polls? One thing that I think has been criminally underexamined in this election cycle has been \"shy voters\" and  enthusiasm on the part of Trump's supporters.\n\n Donald Trump received 5 million more primary votes than any other candidate in the party's history. He routinely draws 15-20,000 people to his rallies. This isn't happening in a vacuum. These people are going back to their communities and advocating for Trump. Driving through Ohio this weekend, I must have seen two dozen Trump/Pence signs. Clinton signs? Four or five.\n\nFacebook is a similar animal. The vitriol and ridicule that Trump gets from articles produced by the journalist intelligentsia are nonstop, and these articles frequently are shared on Facebook. Speaking for my own friends list, FB is an \"unsafe space\" for Trump supporters. I suspect that's the case for many other people. Yet Trump still has that many likes. Why is that the case?\n\nNow, on to polls. In case you weren't aware, polls are not just calling random people and tallying what they think. There is detailed methodology and weighting applied to the raw results. In many cases, the sample of voters is weighted to the turnout demographics  of the 2012 election. As anyone with half a brain is aware, these are not anywhere near the same circumstances.\n\nWhat pollsters are failing to account for IMO is the level of Trump enthusiasm that is motivating people who have not voted for years, if ever. Pretending like the electorate is going to vote the same way it did in 2012 (\"balancing\" the results accordingly) given the results of the campaign so far is idiotic and arrogant at best. At worst? I wouldn't be surprised if pollsters are intentionally weighting polls to craft a narrative that Trumps campaign is in freefall and can't make up the gap. \n\nThat's just my takeaway. Believe what you will. But ask yourself: do you think this election will have the same kind of turnout as 2012, when an incumbent president ran against a conventional politician? \n\nDo some digging and you might find this election is a LOT closer than you're being led to believe.

There are different styles, and the way you were taught could be different, but this style *is* correct as well.\n  \n\"wr\" and \"ur\" do look similar; with perfect handwriting, \"wr\" should be identifiable in that the \"r\" lacks an upstroke on the left-hand side, and begins from the \"tail\" at the end of the \"w.\"  \"ur,\" by comparison, should have complete versions of both letters (which you can see in the first line in the word \"cursive\").\n  \nDoes that make sense?  I'd toss up some images to illustrate my point but it turns out that searching for the word \"handwriting\" in a specific style of handwriting is a difficult task~\n  \nEDIT: also, I meant to mention earlier, but as a handwritten style, the quality and clarity of the script various greatly between individuals, which further clouds things.

I didn't realize you meant two different stores, because honestly, I'd not have found that facepalm-ey. I guess I just figured it was the same store, hence my earlier comments. I don't think this type of price difference is all that uncommon among different stores, for any number of reasons.  I live near a \"big\" city, and prices there tend to be higher I imagine due to higher taxes, loss (theft), and other overhead costs.

I personally find white people feeling sorry for me more demeaning than \"apparently blatant racist things\". But most of my people disagree with my perception. Most of the stuff in the photo only really looks to be exaggerated mockery; although doubtless that people will be offended by the color of their skin. White people did take many things from natives, but most of what was lost was more because Indians are stupid lazy fucks than anything.
