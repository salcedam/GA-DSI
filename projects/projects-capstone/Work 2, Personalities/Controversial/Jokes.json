There is an interesting debate in this [Askhistorians post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hn2eh/askhistorians_consensus_on_mother_theresa/).\n\nThere seems to be little consensus on how culpable Mother Teresa was in the lack of provision of appropriate healthcare. She was not medically trained, nor were any of the nuns who ran the hospitals. they offered *only* a place to die for people who had nowhere else to go, and these places, despite their inability to medically treat people, were still seen as beneficial by a great number of people who flocked to them in masses. The nuns had neither the knowledge, or resources with which to provide medical care though and never pretended otherwise. But still they did what they could to help the poorest and most despised members of society.\n\nThe biggest criticism seems to be only that with the large amount of funding MT ended up with, she should have invested it in building and providing medical facilities. But then you could say that about lots of people who have lots of money and don't use it to build free hospitals for the poor. Mother Theresa may have failed to do more than she did for those under her care, but there is no evidence that she did so through malice or being 'a horrible person'. \n\nThe other criticisms are that there were simple cost-effective or cost-negligible measures she could have put in place that would have alleviated suffering, and yet she didn't. There seems to be little evidence for this either way, though lots of people claim one thing or another.

She was a charity black hole, and the management of the massive amount of money she received was suspicious at best. She neglected to perform basic sanitation practices that probably literally everyone in this thread knows about (Don't just rinse off a needle with warm water and stick it into someone else). She didn't distinguish between curable and incurable patients, so people who would have had a chance had they gone elsewhere died due to infection or not being treated. If she had used the massive amount of money she received effectively, she could have had provided a much much higher level of care to people.\n\nIf you judge her based on her philosophy, still comes across as a not so great person. Certainly against abortion, contraception, and divorce, but I'd be surprised if she wasn't honestly. Rather her view on suffering is what I think makes her terrible. You can easily read direct quotes from her that spell her position out clearly: that poor people suffering is good. Did it come from a bad place? Probably not, she expected it to make them closer to God. But if you were looking for a place for your terminally ill parent or SO, and the hospice director's mission statement was to encourage suffering, would you drop them off proudly? If you had the option to donate to that hospice rather than somewhere else, would you?\n\nWorth pointing out that when she was sick and dying, she received the best care available.

In fact, in the second set of lyrics it points to joe having been the singer's slave, so the cotton-eyed part being a black man with very light blue eyes would be more accurate there. \n\nThen there is the Rednex version, and this changes a lot. I had always figured cotton-eyed meant dreamy or attractive because of the first verse: \n\n*He rode through the fields, so handsome and strong\nHis eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun* \n\nBUT what I never payed attention to was the second verse:\n\n *He brought disaster wherever he went\nThe hearts of the girls was to Hell, broken, sent\nThey all ran away so nobody would know\nAnd left only men 'cause of Cotton-Eye Joe*\n\nThat one could point at him giving them some sort of disease, or having taken their virginity and left so they were so ashamed they ran. One online source said *according to The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, the term describes \"prominent whites of the eyes.\"*.

I believe that needless wars (and all since WWII are needless) the biggest piece of corruption we need to deal with. Bernie has voted against war.

But there's no evidence of him being a sexual predator.\n\nWorse, we know that Gennifer Flowers made big bank (over half a million dollars) via the coverage of her affair with Clinton, and we know that certain conservative forces were paying large amounts of money for muckraking on Clinton, often of dubious veracity at best.\n\nThe three women in question were:\n\n**Juanita Broaddrick:** Big problem here is that she alleged the incident happened in the 1970s when she was a volunteer for the campaign, but only actually made the claim in the late 1990s (1999, to be specific). There are a *lot* of problems with her account - she has signed a sworn deposition that she never had sex with Bill Clinton, for instance, and after the alleged rape she continued to support Bill Clinton and appear with him, despite later claiming it was \"the most horrific event of my life\". Moreover, the people who claim that she had told them about the event were also people who were upset at Bill Clinton - namely, for him commuting the sentence of the man who murdered their father.\n\n**Kathleen Willey:** Made the claim that Bill Clinton groped her in 1993... in 2015. Linda Tripp - the woman who taped the Monica Lewinsky call - said that Wiley was lying - she had sexual contact with the president, but it was consensual - she had been flirting with him, and was happy and excited following it. Notably, Ken Starr did not feel there was anything to follow up on there.\n\n**Paula Jones:** Part of [The American Spectator's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Spectator) \"Arkansas project\" funded by the conservative Bradley Foundation, she claimed that Bill Clinton had propositioned her and exposed himself to her. These allegations are pretty much forever tainted by her association with these people, and the fact that they came out in conjunction with the \"Troopergate\" scandal - where Arkansas State Troopers were said to have acted as enablers of consensual affairs for Bill Clinton.\n\nThis came out from the reporting of David Brock - a man who later admitted that he was engaging in smearjobs against the Clintons on behalf of the American Speculator (something we actually know to be true - the Arkansas Project is well-documented, and millions of dollars were involved). The American Speculator and the Arkansas Project are also responsible for the utterly insane Vince Foster conspiracy theory.\n\nThe rampant dishonesty of those around the whole thing, combined with large sums of money being thrown around, has always drawn these things into question. The fact that people simply made up insane bullshit and promulgated it as the truth is hugely problematic for these claims.\n\nWhether or not he sexually harassed Paula Jones, we'll never know.\n\nBut there's very good reason to be skeptical of these people.", "id": "d8joiek"}, {"comment": "Thought Bill's sexual misdeeds count was up to 17 women, some of them recanted, others paid off, several humiliated:\n\nJuanita Broaddrick, \nKathleen Willey, \nPaula Jones, \nDolly Kyle, \nGennifer Flowers, \nMonica Lewinsky, \nEileen Wellstone, \nElizabeth Gracen, \nSally Perdue, \nConnie Hamzy, \nLencola Sullivan, \nChristy Zercher, \nRegina Blakely, \nSandra James, \nKathy Bradshaw, \nBetty Dalton, \nDenise Reeder.\n\nEdit: Formatting", "id": "d8jlvm6"}, {"comment": "Hillary Clinton attacked all women who accused Bill of rape or sexual assault.", "id": "d8jmkqj"}, {"comment": "My Reddit crashed as soon as I clicked controversial.

But apparently feminists are another species for even bringing this up...", "id": "d7eqz18"}, {"comment": "This is gonna be a little long, but bear with me. Being honest for a minute here, I used to consider myself a feminist. For me, it seemed to be obvious. \"Duh, we can see that women don't get the same treatment as men in some respects, we can fix that.\"\n\nBut the people I found myself discussing issues with began to seem less and less like \"down to earth people who just want equality\" as time went on. They began to become an echo chamber, dialogue seemed to wash away.\n\nI slowly felt pushed out of the movement. First it was a minor disagreement between peers, then it become attitudes about men and generalizations, then in-fighting about issues like Trans-excluding radical feminists and politics in general.\n\nAs I became less bipartisan in my attitudes (shifting to my current stance as independent without party affiliation), I became more excluded from being offered input. Eventually, it hit a point where my arguments weren't even being considered anymore. Someone could simply point out that I was a straight male and that was the end of the conversation, as if my opinions simply didn't count because I have a penis (a factor I cannot control). It didn't matter that I'm Afro-Latino, that wasn't enough of a \"minority card\" to make my opinion worth listening to.\n\nI began to see an unsettling trend in attitudes among feminists my age or younger. A recent example of something that has become not unprevalent is this attitude that voting for someone BECAUSE of their gender is acceptable. For example, look at [this](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/if-its-truly-progressive-labour-will-have-voted-in-a-female-leader-regardless-of-her-policies-10496237.html) article and [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jillian-gutowitz/im-voting-for-hillary-clinton-because-shes-a-woman_b_8684910.html) one.\n\nThe movement doesn't seem to resemble the one that I knew previously. Emma Watson's speech at the UN almost made me want to identify as a feminist again, as I thought the winds might be shifting to a more acceptable climate. But it's been nearly two years, and her speech has been all but forgotten by feminists by and large. I still don't see a larger conversation about the ways men are injured by gender roles, I still don't see a welcoming attitude for men to be part of the discussion. How can I identify as a feminist when my opinions are all but silenced on account of my sex and gender each time I dissent?\n\nThe whole movement has become unwholesome to me, and something I could no longer identify with or support. That's why I dropped the title. For me and others like Christina Sommers, feminism has been hijacked by a new wave of individuals who aren't truly looking for equality, but use the concept to mask their own biases.\n\nSo I don't think it's as easy as people getting in a tizzy. As Watson said, it's become something of a \"dirty word\", and I think feminists at large need to recognize the cancerous attitudes growing within the movement before they expect the world as a whole to adopt it.\n\nI WAS a feminist. I didn't leave of my own volition, and I wasn't dragged out kicking and screaming by outside forces or \"patriarchy\". I was pushed out from within, and I think modern feminism needs to acknowledge that I am not even CLOSE to being the only one this happens to.

He had tractor models, tractor wallpaper, remote control miniature tractors, tractor board games, even some tractor porn(which is not easy to find mind you). The only thing that even came close to his love for tractors, was the love he felt for his wife. His high school sweetheart, who didn't mind his infatuation with tractors one bit. She didn't even mind the role play where she would dress as a tractor, he would dress as a farmer, and he would take her for a \"ride\". Sadly his wife was struck one day, a tractor fell off the back of a transport truck. She didn't die until he was at her side in the hospital. Her dying words \"don't blame the tractor honey\" and with that she headed to the big farm in the sky. Sadly, he did blame the tractor, he hated them now with all his mind, body, and soul. He went home and destroyed ALL his tractor related items, the toys, his wifes tractor suit, and even his collection of tractor porn. He put it all in a pile and burned it in the yard. What ever didn't burn enough to his liking was thrown into a woodchipper. He then went inside, rarely leaving his home, for 8 years. Finally on the 8th anniversary of his darling wifes death he decided it was time to get back out in the dating world, plus the cute cashier at the grocery store had been asking him out for a while now, he called her out to dinner. The restaurant he choose ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that his date, being an asthmatic, was having some trouble breathing. After noticing her displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the dining room, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he rejoined his date she asked \"how on earth did you do that?\" to which he replied, \"I'm an extractor fan.\"\n\n"], [392, "Knew it as soon as I started reading :\\"], [275, "http://i.imgur.com/xMiLJx9.gifv"], [38, "[Spoiler](http://eleventyone.done.hu/fyoop/metalfan.jpg)"], [31, "Where is the greentext?"], [29, "I saw this on 4chan like 5 years ago"], [16, "1125 is pretty good, but 953 is better"], [16, "Jesus christ, fuck yourself with those edits"], [9, "I appreciate that humble brag about having a previous gold post, well done.

He went home and destroyed ALL his tractor related items, the toys, his wifes tractor suit, and even his collection of tractor porn. He put it all in a pile and burned it in the yard. What ever didn't burn enough to his liking was thrown into a woodchipper. He then went inside, rarely leaving his home, for 8 years. Finally on the 8th anniversary of his darling wifes death he decided it was time to get back out in the dating world, plus the cute cashier at the grocery store had been asking him out for a while now, he called her out to dinner. The restaurant he choose ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that his date, being an asthmatic, was having some trouble breathing. After noticing her displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the dining room, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he rejoined his date she asked \"how on earth did you do that?\" to which he replied, \"I'm an extractor fan.\"\n\n", "id": "d994epy"}, {"comment": "I know someone who told a much shorter version of this joke in a context in which it made sense:\n\nA guy is a massive tractor nerd and goes on about them for ages.\nFriend: So I used to like tractors too, but I don't anymore - I'm an ex-tractor fan...\nGuy does not get it and is quite offended.\nFriend has waited his whole life to tell that joke in context and the one guy who really likes tractors... doesn't get it.", "id": "d9963hv"}, {"comment": "This is only amusing if you have some prior association with the term \"extractor fan\".

A friend told it to me a little while back, but this version, which was the first one I found when searching, was copy pasted from Tumblr...\n\n\n\n\nMallory and Mark Kensington were two star struck lovers who had been married for 12 years. Mallory was a commercial airline pilot and Mark was the captain of a nuclear submarine. They were both very responsible with their money, lived simply, had no children, and no vices. The only exception to their frugality was their dog Max whom they doted on at every possible occasion. Unfortunately for Max, fate had terrible plans in store for him. One dark August day, Mallory and Mark were both at their respective jobs and in a cruel twist of fate suffered major mechanical failures at the same time. In a million to one oddity, they both perished in the astonishing first-of-its-kind airplane/submarine accident.\n\nThe funeral was a simple affair, but it was the reading of the will that shocked the attendees; everything they owned had been left to Max. The Kensington family was understandably upset about this, and within a few months time, the lawyers had finagled their way through to screwing Max over with little thought to his feelings. Shortly thereafter, unloved, unwanted, and alone\u2026 Max had been cast out onto the streets of New York penniless. As you can imagine, this was a real hardship for Max.\n\nMax, destitute, wandered for weeks before he finally settled down on the corner of 5th and Main. He found a \u201ccomfortable\u201d cardboard box to live in, and his friend Hobo Jones was relatively sane. Now for Max, this whole new life was a real hardship, and difficult to adjust to but\u2026 he persevered. A few months later, while talking to Hobo Jones, he learned that there was a dog show in town. While an unattended dog at a show may be slightly unusual, Max thought it just might be possible for him to improve his lot in life\u2026 there was a cash prize!\n\nAt the dog show, Max was suitably impressive. He had bathed in the local gutter with Hobo Jones\u2019 help, and positively glowed with a hint of the radiance that he once had under the care of the Kensingtons. The judges muttered among themselves every time they saw him and to a man they decided to award Max first place. Ecstatic, Max approached the judges\u2019 panel. Unfortunately, dog show judges aren\u2019t the most scrupulous of people, and they kept the money, only giving Max his trophy. What dog can complain about being cheated? Faced with yet another hardship, Max lugged his trophy home, whilst the judges had a wild night on the town with the cash that was supposed to go to the winner.\n\nHobo Jones comforted Max when he got back. \u201cMax, it\u2019s OK. I know you got screwed, but hey you got this really neat trophy and at least you\u2019re qualified for the city-wide dog show! Maybe the judges will be better there, and you can really move up.\u201d\n\nMax considered this good advice, and while his hardships seemed overwhelming at times, Hobo Jones had made a fair point. For the next month, Max trained himself like never before. He exercised regularly, worked his fur into a grand sheen, and all around just persevered. The day of the city-wide show came around and he was excited. He trotted down to the performance hall, and quickly impressed everyone in attendance. By time the second round of judging had occurred, he was considered a favorite to win, and by the final round of judging, he was the clear victor. Ecstatic, he rushed to claim his prize.\n\nI don\u2019t wish to dishearten you or cast a pallor on the integrity of dog show judges everywhere but\u2026 Max was just cursed by hardships. The judges at this particular show were, if anything, more corrupt than the previous judges. Max received his trophy, and accolades rang from all but the cash was sadly lacking. These judges liked Vegas more than they liked dogs, and the prize money that no human could claim would get them there in style. Max, heartbroken, trudged home through the pouring rain dragging his (rather large) trophy behind him.\n\nTo the rescue came Hobo Jones. Max\u2019s distressed demeanor was lightened by his antics and encouragement. After all, it was true that he had qualified for the state championships. Besides, Max was practically creating a name for himself in the dog show world\u2026 two overwhelming victories with no owner? Almost preposterous! So, that night, Max curled up around his two trophies and considered that maybe his hardships were coming to an end. He wagged his tail a bit before he fell asleep.\n\nThis same sorry state of affairs continued for Max through State, Regional and even the National dog show. When Max had just won the national dog show, he should have been living the good life, the $10,000 prize would have bought him quite a bit of comfort. Unfortunately, plagued by hardships and corrupt judges, Max had nothing but his five trophies to keep him warm at night. With a frustrated shake of his head, Max decided to simply focus on how he would get to the international dog show in Paris at the end of the year. He decided to see if he could get passage on a ship.\n\nAfter spending an entire day begging every captain he met on the pier to take him along, Max was beginning to despair. Nobody seemed to want a dog underfoot, regardless of how useful he may be. Luckily though, he decided to try one last ship. It was an old thing, and looked like it had come straight out of a story book. It was a ship that had clearly seen better days, and was in fact astonishing for it\u2019s incongruity amongst other more modern ships\u2026 it even had sails! Max trotted up to the grizzled old sea captain and bade him good afternoon. Astonishingly, Max\u2019s luck seemed to take a turn right away for the captain immediately lit up and started chatting like they had been old friends his whole life. Within an hour, Max had secured passage to Paris (provided he work during transit) and had found a new friend.\n\nThe following morning, Max took his leave of Hobo Jones and boarded the ship. For many months they sailed and had many grand adventures, but this story is not about those. Suffice it to say that the captain and Max grew very fond of one another, and they shared many stories of hardships that each at faced. When they finally reached Paris, the captain promised to wait for Max, and wished him good luck at the show.\n\nThis was it! The international dog show that Max had been preparing for for so many months. He strutted in confidently and was greeted with uproarious applause\u2026 he was practically famous now! The dog with no owner, the champion extraordinaire. Round after round of judging, dog after dog was eliminated. Finally, it came down to just two dogs, Max and another Yorkshire named Augustus Winthrop the Third. The judges whispered amongst themselves for an eternity.\n\nAs you well know, the prize for the international dog show is nothing to sneeze at. It well exceeds thousands of pounds, and could set all of Max\u2019s hardships aside for the duration of his life. Unfortunately, human greed being what it is and Max\u2019s lack of human company being what it was\u2026 he never had a chance. With yet another cruel laugh from the fates, the judges awarded Max the title of champion dog, the trophy, the accolades, and\u2026 not the money. Max faced with yet another hardship, lugged the huge trophy back to the ship, and sadly went to his bunk. Tired out, and depressed, he promptly fell asleep. The captain, knowing what had occurred the moment he saw Max arrive, decided to leave immediately and cursed the judges heartily as they sailed out of port.\n\nSeveral hours later, a freak storm blew up. Sailors were cursing, the captain was wide-eyed with stress, and Max was awoken by the noise. He scampered to deck just in time to notice a sailor caught in the rigging trying to bring down one of the sails. Without pausing a moment to think, Max bounded up the rigging and immediately helped the sailor free, chewing through the ropes that had ensnared him. He let the sailor down first and was about to follow suit when a sudden wave rocked the ship violently and the worst happened. Max lost his grip.\n\nMax fell.\n\nMax hit the deck.\n\nMax didn\u2019t move.\n\nIn one of those weird little moments of life, the sudden fury of the world paused. The sailors all gasped, shocked. The captain turned his eyes towards Max. Nobody moved. Nothing moved. They all prayed silently for the poor dog, hoping against hope that he would rise once more. The spell was broken by the first mate who took a step forward, then another, another\u2026 tears were appearing in his eyes. Then, miracle of miracles\u2026 Max got up. He was fine! The sailors all cheered, shouting for joy. The first mate, astonished, turned to the captain and said,\n\n\u201cCaptain, how could Max survive a fall like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d said the captain, unsurprised in the least, \u201che was used to hard ships.\u201d\n\n", "id": "d99hjv4"}, {"comment": "http://i.imgur.com/3CsFHYm.gif", "id": "d99i2n5"}, {"comment": "Way to fucking long.

I guess classics never die!"], [685, "Did it make him cum harder than ever before?"], [293, "I always liked this version more, though it is longer.\n\nThere was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, \"Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. \"Except what?\" the man asked. \"Nothing, nothing.\" \"C'mon, tell me! I need something!\" \"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'\" \"So what's up with this voodoo dick?\" he asked.\n\nThe old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said \"Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\" The old man replied, \"But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.\" He pointed to a door and said \"Voodoo dick, the door.\" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said \"Voodoo dick, get back in your box!\" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. \"I'll take it!\" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say \"Voodoo dick, my pussy.\" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.\n\nAfter he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \"Voodoo dick, my pussy!\" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.\n\nThe officer looked at her for a second, and then said \"Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!\""], [246, "Best dildo joke ever"], [163, "He knows exactly how it works. Why do you think he dumped her?"], [65, "OP's name is strangely fitting"], [43, "Great magic dido, op's ass!"], [30, "A girl has no dildo."], [22, "Relevant Username"], [23, "Sure, it is hilarious thinking about a guy getting accidentally butt fucked by a magical pink dildo... but there are a lot of plot holes in the story that I would like to address.  \n\nThe relationship between this girl and her mother is unhealthy. I understand that some women (I am a man) have very open relationships with their mothers, and will tell them anything.  But it makes no rational sense to open the conversation with her concerns about having sex again. Clearly the girl has emotional detachment issues, and only looks at the opposite sex as a means of sexual satisfaction.  This trait was likely inherited from her mother. Instead of trying to comfort the girl on an emotional level, the mother quickly responds by presenting her with a magical sex toy. The mother, like her daughter, has let carnal pleasure become her number one priority in life, and when there is no man to fill that void, she wastes no time to satisfy her cravings by other means.  Her lack of focus on the emotional issues that likely caused the separation is likely the reason why we don't see a father figure in the joke, which brings me to my next point. \n\nMost people automatically assume the boyfriend is the 'bad guy' for dumping the girl. At the end of the joke we realize the magical dildo is going to penetrate his rectum, and we get some sense of satisfaction that \"justice is served\". This preconceived notion is unwarranted.  We have already established the girl suffers from male emotional detachment.  More than likely the boy dumped the girl because he is a more mature individual, who understands that there is more to a relationship than just sex. He doesn't seem like a bad guy at all. In fact, when he hears something going on in his ex-girlfriends room, he comes \"barging in\" to see if she is okay. Why did he go back to his ex-girlfriends house?  Why does he come barging in after he hears noises that are either sexual or painful in nature?  You know why. He still has an emotional attachment to the girl, and needs to know that she is okay. As his conversation begins with \"Hey listen, I want to talk to yo-...\",   we can see that he would like to begin what looks like a conversation to reconcile differences. Maybe he wants to see if the girl would be willing to attend couple's therapy to address her extreme emotional issues because he loves her, and an afternoon without her is too much to bare.  The boyfriend is the 'good guy', which leads me to my last point. \n\nWhat the fuck is up with this magical dildo? What dark magic was used to create this phallus. From magical myth, we know that nothing can be created without something being taken away. Is this Satan's dick itself?  All that aside, should we assume the sodomy that is about to ensue upon the bewildered boyfriend will be unpleasant? The only thing we know about this dildo is that, \"it will do the job\". Maybe in the boyfriend's situation, the dildo slowly takes off his pants and carefully caresses his rim before inserting itself.  Maybe the dildo realizes the boyfriend needs more than physical satisfaction to achieve orgasm, and begins a month long courting period to connect on an emotional level before getting into his pants and touching is A-spot.  \n\nAt the end of the joke, I am not laughing at the fact that the boyfriend is about to get anal raped, I am laughing at the girl. I am laughing because she will never get the dildo back, and she doesn't deserve it. She will have to live out the rest of her pathetic life knowing that she will never again experience the pleasure she felt that day, and the boyfriend she pushed away now has the only thing she cares about. I am laughing at her pain.\nEdit: Conclusion"], [20, "> She lies down on the floor holding the dildo\n\nI thought it was going in another direction at that point:\n\n> That's when the dildo got up and left because she is too clingy"], [17, "This is actually a sad ending. The dildo goes into the guy's ass and pleases him so much that he becomes gay, dumps the girl, moves to the bay area and ends up in an abusive relationship with a drug dealer named Pepe. He gets AIDS from Pepe, since Pepe is addicted to Heroin and used the wrong dirty needle. Meanwhile, the girl has spiraled into depression at the loss of her love (and magic dildo). She can't hold a job and is forced to turn tricks on the street for money. She loses the will to live while she accepts whatever someone pays to put into her mouth. One night after a violent customer, she jumps off the tallest bridge in town and hits the water with just enough force to break her neck and paralyze her, but doesn't die. The guy visits her just weeks before dying of AIDS. Down to 98 pounds and full of open sores, he weeps openly with her amidst apologies.

She was slick with sweat, she wore shorts and a tank top, both were ragged with the tiny lacerations from the various barbed plants that infested the jungle.\n\nHer eyes widened as she looked upon that which stood in the glade, that which she had toiled for months to find, poring over volume after volume of forbidden lore in dusty old books, seeking out the ancestors of the indigenous aztec tribes of deepest south america and losing three guides to dyssentery and one to a Jaguar that she had to strangle to death with her last thong. \n\nBut after days of following these ancient, lost paths, she had found it; the ancient shrine of Quetzalcuclitlol. The Aztec goddess of pleasure. \n\nShe stumbled forward, grasping at the edge of one of the overgrown fountains that dotted the glade and drank deep of the cool waters that bubbled forth.\n\n After drinking her fill she crept forward, remembering from the old texts that she still faced two challenges. One of the mind and one of the soul. \n\nThe young woman saw no sign of danger so rushed towards the great statue that stood at the centre of the clearing, it was that of a ten-foot woman, beautifully rendered in stone, curiously free of vines, her legs were spread wide and the mythical prize she dearly sought was buried deep inside her: the magical dildo of Quetzalcuclitlol.\n\nSuddenly she heard a rustling and before she could react, an old woman burst from the dense scrub that surrounded the shrine. The woman was dressed in the garb of a shaman, her hand was outstretched and the young woman found that she could not move, let alone speak! The shaman's voice croaked: \n\n\"I am the high priestess of Quetzalcuclitlol and you must answer me these questions three:\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\nShe felt the grip on her throat slacken.\n\n\"Marianne Summers!\"\n\n\"What is your quest?\" \n\n\"I seek the magical dildo!\"\n\n\"What is the name of the german gynecologist who discovered the supreme erogenous zone?\" \n\n\"Ernst Graphenberg!\"\n\nThe old woman began to laugh and threw her hands into the air\n\n\"Your mind is worthy, now go and test your soul.\" And with that she turned to smoke and shadow which swirled back into the jungle.\n\nMarianne fell to her knees, her throat felt bruised but she pushed herself to her feet and rushed towards the statue, as she came before the holy vagina, the ancient, foreign text of the plaque carved into the base translated itself before her eyes:\n\n'Only she who is pure of soul and who seeks pleasure beyond reckoning can take up my dildo. Anyone else will surely die.\"\n\nHer hand, quivvering reached out and grasped the exposed, thick base and she pulled with all her might. Throughout the glade came the almighty sound of deep and sultry moaning as if a dusky woman were rapt in the throes of supreme pleasure. The ground began to shake and the trees began to shudder and as the dildo began to come free the moaning grew louder until all marianne could hear was the orgasm of the ancient god.\n\nAnd then all at once, with a shout and a sigh she fell backwards, in her hands she clutched the artifact of her desire. Looking up she saw that the statue of Quetzalcuclitlol had changed. She now reclined as if in repose and Marianne could swear that the smooth features of her stony face were blushing.

He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, \"Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. \"Except what?\" the man asked. \"Nothing, nothing.\" \"C'mon, tell me! I need something!\" \"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'\" \"So what's up with this voodoo dick?\" he asked.\n\nThe old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said \"Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\" The old man replied, \"But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.\" He pointed to a door and said \"Voodoo dick, the door.\" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said \"Voodoo dick, get back in your box!\" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. \"I'll take it!\" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say \"Voodoo dick, my pussy.\" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.\n\nAfter he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \"Voodoo dick, my pussy!\" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.\n\nThe officer looked at her for a second, and then said \"Yeah, right..

I understand that some women (I am a man) have very open relationships with their mothers, and will tell them anything.  But it makes no rational sense to open the conversation with her concerns about having sex again. Clearly the girl has emotional detachment issues, and only looks at the opposite sex as a means of sexual satisfaction.  This trait was likely inherited from her mother. Instead of trying to comfort the girl on an emotional level, the mother quickly responds by presenting her with a magical sex toy. The mother, like her daughter, has let carnal pleasure become her number one priority in life, and when there is no man to fill that void, she wastes no time to satisfy her cravings by other means.  Her lack of focus on the emotional issues that likely caused the separation is likely the reason why we don't see a father figure in the joke, which brings me to my next point. \n\nMost people automatically assume the boyfriend is the 'bad guy' for dumping the girl. At the end of the joke we realize the magical dildo is going to penetrate his rectum, and we get some sense of satisfaction that \"justice is served\". This preconceived notion is unwarranted.  We have already established the girl suffers from male emotional detachment.  More than likely the boy dumped the girl because he is a more mature individual, who understands that there is more to a relationship than just sex. He doesn't seem like a bad guy at all. In fact, when he hears something going on in his ex-girlfriends room, he comes \"barging in\" to see if she is okay. Why did he go back to his ex-girlfriends house?  Why does he come barging in after he hears noises that are either sexual or painful in nature?  You know why. He still has an emotional attachment to the girl, and needs to know that she is okay. As his conversation begins with \"Hey listen, I want to talk to yo-...\",   we can see that he would like to begin what looks like a conversation to reconcile differences. Maybe he wants to see if the girl would be willing to attend couple's therapy to address her extreme emotional issues because he loves her, and an afternoon without her is too much to bare.  The boyfriend is the 'good guy', which leads me to my last point. \n\nWhat the fuck is up with this magical dildo? What dark magic was used to create this phallus. From magical myth, we know that nothing can be created without something being taken away. Is this Satan's dick itself?  All that aside, should we assume the sodomy that is about to ensue upon the bewildered boyfriend will be unpleasant? The only thing we know about this dildo is that, \"it will do the job\". Maybe in the boyfriend's situation, the dildo slowly takes off his pants and carefully caresses his rim before inserting itself.  Maybe the dildo realizes the boyfriend needs more than physical satisfaction to achieve orgasm, and begins a month long courting period to connect on an emotional level before getting into his pants and touching is A-spot.  \n\nAt the end of the joke, I am not laughing at the fact that the boyfriend is about to get anal raped, I am laughing at the girl. I am laughing because she will never get the dildo back, and she doesn't deserve it. She will have to live out the rest of her pathetic life knowing that she will never again experience the pleasure she felt that day, and the boyfriend she pushed away now has the only thing she cares about. I am laughing at her pain.\nEdit: Conclusion", "id": "d3lyqlo"}, {"comment": "This is the best thing I've read in a long time", "id": "d3lzged"}, {"comment": "...

The teacher asks Mr The Great if he would like to lead the discussion of the word \"tragedy.\" So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stands up and offers: \"If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway ox comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy.\" \"No,\" says Mr The Great, \"that would be an accident.\" A little girl raises her hand: \"If a school chariot carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.\" \"I'm afraid not,\" explains the exalted conqueror. \"That's what we would call a great loss.\" The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Mr The Great searches the room. \"Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?\" Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: \"If a private chariot carrying you was struck by a catapult and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.\" \"Fantastic!\" exclaims Mr The Great, \"That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?\" \"Well,\" says the boy, \"because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either.\"\n\n\nThere, now they have\n\nedit: put it in Greek too.", "id": "d920zuy"}, {"comment": "I was going to blindly comment about the technology differences but decided to read first.\n\nGood thing I did.

IMO, it's not the number but the attitude of a person about their sexual health. By all means, do and be with whomever, just be safe and sane about it. That and is it sex they're truly wanting?--I've come to realize that many people like and go about sex for the wrong reasons (think attention seeking, self-esteem, etc).\n\nI'm less apt to think its the efforts you mentioned that sets tone as to why it is the way it is. I think slut shaming/name calling is more based on what the activity is more or less intended for: reproducing. \n\nThe greatest filter we have from keeping idiots and weak genes from reproducing is   each other--if people are indiscriminate of scrubs then natural selection has failed. Men are \"studs\" because 'they have the greatest to gain from sex--they \"succeeded\" in passing their genes (not to say she didn't pass her genes too but c'mon ya'll, it's a man's world). Somehow, some way, they were judged worthy enough to get it in and keep it (their genes, legacy) going. Men* don't care what you call them; that won't ruin the drive. Women* on the other hand, not so much--they balance each other out.\n\nWhen someone calls someone a slut I hear \"They lack a sense of quality.\" Whereas when I hear a person is a stud, I hear \"They are virile and sexually established.\"\n\nYou mention that women have the 'pick of the litter' and thus just nearly need to breath to be a prospect. While I see some truth in that, if men never approach, that's kind of a null point. It may beg the question why more men don't trust women who pursue sex? (what she's after is not sex is he mindset).\n\nEnough with the ramblings--I agree with you but figure it to be more than just what each party is expected to do vs their role in sex.\n\n", "id": "d53fxzx"}, {"comment": "Yeah makes sense.

He was an extremely introverted, highly fat and unhealthy nerd, but he was an awesome guy who had a lot of talent, and we loved him all the same. We'd still hang out for a few years after high school, but eventually we went separate ways. \n\nOne day, out of the blue, \"Jennifer Wise\" sent a request on facebook (Jeremy *loathed* social media). She was very fit and obviously a happy, active, and social person judging by her pictures. She had a striking similarity to Jeremy's face, so I came to the conclusion that she was his cousin or something. I told her so. Oops, strike one. Then I thought back to his type of humor... \"oh, he's just pulling one of his super bizarre pranks; he got fit and stuffed his shirt.\" I said so. Strike two. It was honestly a huge shock that it was real, and was almost impossible to comprehend. Luckily, Jennifer found it all hilarious. We continued to talk until the day I deleted my facebook account, and that was that. The point I'm trying to make here is that our group of friends had a lot of problems with past and present tense names and pronouns, and it's still a challenge talking about her. It feels even weirder because Jeremy and Jennifer are two entirely different people; one was a depressed, horribly obese outcast (who harbored identity issues unknown to family and friends), the other is a very active and fit social butterfly who now programs for a certain well-known social media site.\n\nThe hormones changed the brain as much as the body, and the results were 100% positive, except for us, the old crew.

I appreciate the link and all.  But Feminist (like Socialist and Libertarian) carries a very different connotation in other cultures.  More or less it goes by the 'equal opportunity' or egalitarian definition not an insulting pejorative one.\n\nThe site doesn't say that all men are rapists or something.  For various reasons most rapes are done by men against women.  Encouraging men to be vocally anti-rape and pro-consent isn't demonizing them as a whole but is a proven and practical way to reduce other men from crossing that line by ensuring it's more clearly drawn and uncool.  This approach is the norm from college campuses to military units.  \n\nSource: Worked as a licensed Sexual Assault Survivor's Advocate.", "id": "dai32a2"}, {"comment": "Have you considered that the reason that you rarely hear about men being raped/sexually assaulted by women is that there is no advantage for a man to report such a rape/assault?\n\nThey won't be believed.  They'll certainly be blamed and shamed.  They'll probably be arrested for \"making it up\".  They won't be protected if the rapist retaliates for the allegation, and besides, the law imposes no meaningful penalty on female rapists.\n\nPromoting the notion that abuse is something that can only be done by men and to women  (and never the other way around) is evil.  I don't mean to take anything away from the women who've been attacked -- they've endured horrible trauma, and seen the face of evil -- but to pretend that men cannot be victims, and that all women are helpless and cannot be perpetrators is not helping.", "id": "daifci9"}, {"comment": "I haven't seen any mainstream scientific or social services pretend men can't be victims.  In male dominated settings like most militaries, most rapes are actually male-perpetrated on males.  Male non-reporting of rapes, including when done to them by other men or by women, is indeed quite high as you suspect.  At the very least though, men can report rapes and should in some way especially if they will benefit from the support services--which mostly being used by women tend to have front-ends focusing on that (sadly to detriment of male survivors).  But the support isn't itself gender-biased.  Someone feeling they have been assaulted should always be met with empathy and a presumption they're telling the truth--it's doubly traumatic to not be believed.  That doesn't mean we need to assume the whole story and condemn anyone we're peers with, only that we provide support to those who may be hurting.\n\nAnd let alone males, most rapes are difficult to prosecute.  Most cases not being physically violent and done by those well-known by the \"survivor\", the most common types of rapes are essentially coercion or psychological force.  Add that to the inherent difficulty to presume consent or intent for an event that happened in the past and it's a thorny issue.  There are surely cases where someone was negligent when they should have noticed their partner felt threatened and couldn't properly respond (some traumatically realize they *have raped* years beforehand), but most rapes seem to be by repeat perpetrators who get off on it.\n\nSadly, when something bad is happening people often freeze up and this fight or flight response has a different bell curve between men and women when being assaulted, which affects who gets targeted.  Nature or nurture, that and strength are issues.  A chronic rapist usually tends to prefer being stronger than their target, which also affects the somewhat more gender-balanced reports of perpetrators of sexual abuse of minors.\n\nWell, this is all heavy stuff.  Anyhow you've got a good head on your shoulders so just be cautious when figuring out the tone of these things since it's got so many layers.  Documents are often about male perpetrators and female survivors because that's what we mainly see reported, but a that we often generalize it unnecessarily dissuades some men from getting support.\n", "id": "daiqoh5"}, {"comment": "Sadly you are asking for all people to be rational and open to opposing world views.

The exchange the futures were traded on got record fines for allowing the deals to go through.  TravelGate where she decided before moving to Washington to replace the White House travel office with one of her cousins.  When the existing employees who aren't political appointees and are permanent staff complained about being sacked she accused them all of fraud and assassinated their characters.  Eventually they were all cleared of any wrong doing but three years after they were sacked they got a lengthy audit from the IRS.\n\nThe list of offences goes on and on whether it's deliberate mus-reporting of election expenses such as during her New York Senate run a private businessman paid for a fundraising dinner worth $1.5 million.  Hillary to reduce her reported campaign spending booked it as being worth $500,000 for which she got fined $50,000.\n\nIn Bill's last day as President he pardoned 450 people by far and away the highest number ever pardoned by any out going president including drug dealers, members of the Columbian cartels, tax evaders, ponzi scheme runners etc.  Hillary's brothers received $400,000 for lobbying for those pardons.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation doesn't report accurate statements about how much it raises or spends.  It's in breach of local, state and Federal law.  It's whole purpose seems to be to get publicity for the Clintons and to turn foreign donations into money that can be used to improve the Clinton's quality of life eg. hiring private jets for them or for spending on political campaigning.

Vauxhall Elementary*, a bitterly divided court issued a 5-4 opinion authored by Justice Kennedy (with Justices Scalia **and** Thomas both seeing fit to weigh in with separate dissents), reversing the 9^th Circuit Appellate decision (*en banc*) and remanding the case to the trial court with instructions to issue a judgment in accordance with their holding, that \n\n>third grader Timmy Rosecrantz was indeed \"out\" of the game of Musical Chairs, despite the fact that he had firmly grasped the chair before classmate Arturo Garza, because he nonetheless failed to secure his position by making buttocular contact with the seat portion of the chair. \n\nIn a surprising break from what was generally thought to be well-settled law, the court ruled that the lateral sliding maneuver employed by Master Garza,\n\n> while not preferred and which made \"a little too rough\" contact between the boys' hip and thigh regions, thereby blocking Master Rosencrantz's *[sic]* achievement of a \"safe\" position upon the cessation of the music, was nevertheless binding upon the parties.\n\nThe late Justice Scalia was enraged at this outcome noting,\n\n> the majority  disingenuously disregard[ed] the finding of fact by the trial court, verified by the testimony of multiple witnesses, that the classroom teaching assistant, Mrs. Schlobaum, had pressed the pause button twice, and then a third time, causing a rapid stop, start, stop of the music and imposing an unfair disadvantage upon Timmy. \n\nAt the very least, he seemed to plead, \"there simply must be a redo.\"\n\nThe majority addressed Scalia's concerns in the main body of the opinion, first by citing other credible testimony found in the record showing that Timmy had not been playing within the spirit of the game:\n\n> . . . [B]y \"hovering\" over and placing his hand on each chair he passed while the music played, Master Rosecrantz was engaging in a blatant attempt to gain an advantage both in terms of obstructing the other players and by effectively reducing the distance required for him to attain a seat [once the music was] paused.\n\nAnd then by noting that although the notion of a \"redo\" seemed to have some merit, it was impractical, as some time had passed since the events in question and Timmy was currently on deployment in Afghanistan, while Arturo had suffered a football neck injury that left him partially paralyzed below the waist. The whereabouts of the other participants were unknown and in any event, the record was unclear as to who else was still \"in\" at the time of the incident.\n\nJustice Thomas concurred with Scalia's dissent but went further by stating that, from his understanding of how the game had historically been played dating back to the 1700s, \n\n> departure from the long-standing rule preventing utilization of grossly aggressive physical contact would have serious repercussions on a national scale. \n\nIn a rare showing of emotion, Justice Thomas related his own story of how, after his father had left his family and their house burnt down, he was sent to live with his grandparents in Savannah, Georgia. As the \"new kid\" at school, a similar incident had transpired, yet his teacher \"had the wherewithal to enforce the rule and call the other boy out.\" He went on to say this demonstration of the \"rule of law,\" in an otherwise unjust South, inspired him to become a lawyer and set him on the path to a seat on the SCOTUS.\n\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\nTl;dr - the Supreme Court doesn't fuck around when it comes to Musical Chairs", "id": "d20vw64"}, {"comment": "You put a lot of effort into this", "id": "d21008k"}, {"comment": "[Let's watch](https://media.riffsy.com/images/0243ae470d6447909876993fadcf8841/raw)", "id": "d202c19"}, {"comment": "http://i.imgur.com/tZm0J19.gifv", "id": "d20385u"}, {"comment": "[dis](http://i.imgur.com/J6BcVPF.gif)", "id": "d203haz"}, {"comment": "[mmmmm](http://i.imgur.com/AEvUG.gif)", "id": "d204kmi"}, {"comment": "[Popcorn time](https://media3.giphy.com/media/ffPjsPLnTCmxa/200w.gif)", "id": "d204jw6"}, {"comment": "[Popcorn?](https://media.giphy.com/media/TlK63EF1YdizKTfdYic/giphy.gif)", "id": "d20jz6m"}, {"comment": "It never occurred to me until your question mark right now that Terrell Owens probably didn't realize that was popcorn in that cup.

No trial, no appeal, nothing.  Feminism says women are people, but people often lie and women never do, apparently.  Nevermind the Duke lacrosse and UVA rape hoaxes, among others and countless false allegations that don't make the news.  Rationality has no place in feminism.\n\nVAWA, based on the Duluth model and pushed into legislation by feminism, requires the police to arrest the man in domestic violence disputes, no matter what.  Nevermind that women commit domestic violence at the same rate as men, nevermind if the man in a given DV call hasn't touched the woman - he gets arrested no matter what thanks to feminism and as usual, she gets the r/pussypass.\n\nUpon entering university, we are taught by feminists not to rape in compulsory consent classes.  In other words we're told that being born male makes us such horrible people that we need specialized training by people who hate us or we'll egregiously harm other people.  The equivalent would be if all women were required to be taught by MRAs not to abuse their children.

There is nothing ambiguous about it, there is exactly one side of the debate who are twisting the truth and shouting down any who dissent.  The remaining 5-6% can be any number of factors, not the least of which being that men tend to negotiate their wages more, and tend to negotiate more favorable outcomes, and spend more time at work.

I also take issue with the social agenda, which seems to lose sight of the difference between women being systematically fucked over and things generally not being perfect for everyone. Feminists claim that women are objectified for their appearance, but men are objectified just as much, and for traits far more out of their control (e.g. height, baldness, penis size). They complain that men give them unwanted attention, and sometimes equate it to sexual assault, but never consider that women's unwillingness to approach men or more importantly their unwillingness to advance things physically necessitates risk taking on our part, and often those risks won't be well-received. \n\nFinally, I cannot stand that *most* feminist complaints and ideals draw primarily from outcomes rather than circumstances. Essentially they are fighting for equal results instead of equal opportunity. Feminists will point to STEM fields and say, \"Where are all the women?

Regardless, the situation of violence against women, the suppression of women's rights, how women are treated in their homes and outside is abysmal around the world. \n\nBy comparison,  ~~twitter~~ pop feminism seems so incredibly superficial and sometimes just thinly disguised misandry. One of the interesting things I've noticed from the various documentaries, books, and articles I've read about regarding women all over the world in these countries is how non-hostile women are toward men. They don't hate the men, rather, they hate the culture that has driven them to such lows. It's the difference between hating \"The Patriarchy\" and just hating men.\n\nI'm by no means an expert, and perhaps I'm suffering a bit from the Dunning Kruger effect, but it seems to me that feminism in the U.S., at least in the online sphere, has become so fickle and spiteful as to lose all credibility and indeed hurt the movement. \n\nAn example is the 76% earnings meme that goes about everywhere. 76% is what happens if you add up women's earnings and mens earnings and then look at the resulting percentages of contributions.

Just because someone claims to agree with you doesn't mean that they hold the same views on the issues. \n\n[This Stanford study from 2014](http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2014/why-does-john-get-stem-job-rather-jennifer) found that, for identical resumes, a male candidate was offered the job at a higher salary more often than the female candidate in a STEM field.

I went through a box plant in Louisville and watched two or three guys standing below a female tech on a scissor lift openly staring at her butt. I really should have said or done something, but I was going to have to work with them for a few days and I didn't want to make the work difficult by having them hate me. That was how *I* felt about speaking up as an outsider with the benefit of not having that happen to me-- it must have been way worse for that poor tech to have to put up with that nonsense. \n\nAnd that's far from the only story of this I've heard. Sometimes it's someone who thinks he's being funny saying stuff like, \"stop worrying about the math and make me cookies, I'm sure you're better at that,\" sometimes it's more open-- asking why a woman was assigned to their work group when \"we all know this isn't a woman's job.\"\n\nBut let's leave the workplace and look at love lives. I'll preface this by saying: there are male victims of rape and there are false rape accusations, and both are horrible and both need to be addressed. That doesn't go away, but the numbers still show that [20% of women (1/5) can expect to be raped in their lifetime as of 2013.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-16192494). Conversely, a 2010 CDC study found that [male rape was around ~~1 in 71~~ 6.2% when accounting for forced penetration.](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf). That doesn't suddenly mean that the men who have been victims of sexual assault don't matter, but it shows that this is something that disproportionately affects women.
