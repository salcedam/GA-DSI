Always look for skincare products without alcohol and without fragrance if possible. Also, check out reviews online at sites like Beautypedia to see if the AHA/BHA product you're using has an adequately low Ph as their efficacy goes down if the Ph is not at the correct level. \n\n Another good tip is to avoid the sun and always to wear sunscreen if you're going to be exposed to sunlight - even on cloudy days.
