This makes you look self-motivated and turns a negative (lack of exp) into a positive.  Waiting tables looks better than being unemployed, but having a 9-5 (if thats relevant to your field) looks better than waiting tables.  Do what you need to do. \n\nYou need to be *and act* hungry when you get out of school.  There is a ton of competition.  Employers will always, always go for someone with relevant experience if it's possible.  College does not give you job experience.  That's why it's best to just get a real job ASAP and not be picky fresh out of school.\n\nEdit:  If you have to be unemployed... Learn a language.  Learn how to use computers well.  Learn a trade.

Mike Shinoda (emcee/secondary vocals/pianist/back-up guitarist) wrote Breaking The Habit WITHOUT the influence of Chester Bennington (lead vocals/back-up guitarist). Interestingly enough, when Chester first read the lyrics he was so overwhelmed that it brought him to tears because he could relate to it so much. In fact, for a long time he struggled to play the song live because of the emotional stress it put him through. He has cried several times during live performances of BTH.\n\n>Memories consume / like opening the wound / I'm picking me apart again\n\nClear nod toward mental illness. His thoughts are running wild and he is tearing himself apart for it.\n\n>You all assume / I'm safe here in my room / unless I try to start again\n\nMany people who are battling mental illness tend to lock themselves away and be reclusive, which often leads to self-harm (or relapse)... however, this also applies to drug addicts.\n\n>I don't want to be the one / the battles always choose / 'cause inside I realize / that I'm the one confused\n\nVery heavily leaning toward mental illness due to the wording. He is sick of fighting battles with himself, battles that his own mind creates.\n\n>I don't know what's worth fighting for / or why I have to scream / I don't know why I instigate / and say what I don't mean\n\nConfusion on whether or not he has a reason to live. Also touches on the fact that mentally unstable people often have outbursts that hurt those around them.\n\n>I don't know how I got this way / I know it's not alright so I'm / breaking the habit / I'm breaking the habit / tonight\n\nConfusion on how he became addicted/mentally ill. Understanding that he has a problem and declaring that he is waging a war with himself to cure himself.\n\n>Clutching my cure\n\nCure being either a self-harm implement (knife/razor/lighter/what-have-you) or his drug of choice.\n\n>I tightly lock the door / I try to catch my breath again\n\nMaking sure that no-one is able to see it happen and dealing with the physical (and mental) pain of his relapse.\n\n>I hurt much more / than anytime before / I had no options left again\n\nHis relapse was so powerful that he went above and beyond his usual \"fix\", whether that be drugs or self-harm. \"Had no options\" meaning that he struggled with the battle, and lost.\n\n>I'll paint it on the walls\n\nOne of a few things: declaring his suicide attempt, saying that he will spill his own blood; OR writing a suicide note OR becoming open about his weakness\n\n>'cause I'm the one at fault\n\nAddicts, self-harmers and the mentally ill often blame themselves.\n\n>I'll never fight again / and this is how it ends\n\nEither declaring that he has lost his battle, or that he has won.\n\nThe song is not necessarily about addiction, nor is it necessarily about self-harm. The song is extremely vague, but it absolutely is about self-destructive tendencies... Just like Given Up:\n\n>Wake in a sweat again / another day's been laid to waste / in my disgrace\n\nPeople who suffer from depression and anxiety often experience severe nightmares/night terrors, and are known to spend their entire day locked in their room, alone, hating themselves and their lifestyle. However, addicts often wake in a sweat because they need \"their fix\", and, especially those addicted to downers such as heroin, often become couch potatos and regret their addiction after the come-down.\n\n>Stuck in my head again / feels like I'll never leave this place / there's no escape\n\nCould be a reference to the fact that mental illness feels like a trap, or it could referring to the addiction being psychological and entrapping.\n\n>I'm my own worst enemy\n\nAgain - the writer could be his own worst enemy because of his self-loathing caused by his mental illness(es), or because he is the one that feeds his own addiction.\n\n>I've given up / I'm sick of feeling / is there nothing you can say? / Take this all away / I'm suffocating / tell me what the fuck is wrong / with me\n\nThis SCREAMS mental illness. The writer is so over his emotional instability that he begs to never feel emotion again. He asks for help (is there nothing you can say?), and death (I've given up / take this all away), and blames himself for his illness.\n\n>I don't know what to take / thought I was focused but I'm scared / I'm not prepared\n\n50/50. \"I don't know what to take\" could be confusion on what drugs the writer should (ab)use, \"thought I was focused but I'm scared / I'm not prepared\" heavily implies that he is trying to fight the illness/addiction but is overwhelmed by it.\n\n>I hyperventilate / looking for help somehow, somewhere / and no one cares\n\nThis, again, screams mental illness. Even in today's society, many people misunderstand mental illnesses and ignore those who suffer. That being said, it could well be uncertainty of who to speak to about addiction.\n\n>God! / put me out of my misery / put me out of my misery / put me out of my / put me out of my fucking misery\n\nBegging to a higher power for death - common among both the mentally ill, and drug addicts. \n\n\nLinkin Park are renowned for their powerful lyrical intricacy (inb4 HURR DURR CRAWLING circlejerk), and the relatability of their lyrics.\n\n**Excuse the horrifically long comment.

The 500 million is based off trumps personal estimates, so for consistency we can look at his personal estimates now which is 10 billion. Forbes put his value at 200 million then and currently puts his value at around 4.5 billion. Lets go with the two forbes numbers.\n\nSo 200 million, 36 years, in safe long term index funds which have an average return rate of 7% (the long term stock market average), that would make his net worth around 2.2 billion today, well less than the 4.5 billion forbes says he's now worth. That means he more than doubled the market, not an easy thing to do. It gets worse though, because his 4.5 billion is after paying taxes every year between 1983 and now. The only fair way to compare the two numbers is to look at how much he would have if he had been paying taxes every year between then and now. Long term capital gains tax rates are 20%, so that 2.2 billlion would go down to 1.76, less than half of what his net worth is.\n\nBut hey, Trump said his net worth was actually 500 million in 1983! We've got him in a trap, either he was lying then or hes not a very good businessman! Well if you want to use his estimate then, its only fair to use his estimate now. Post tax, 7% return, 36 years later, his income would be 4.56, again less than half of what he managed to earn on his own.

The guy already had a ton of money when he started and would have basically been able to be pretty wealthy regardless of what he did, unless he fucked up majorly or got very unlucky.

And I agree that being born rich and using that money to make yourself more rich isn't as huge an accomplishment. But I don't know enough about economics or Trump's specific business history to definitively say that the guy didn't make *any* smart business decisions to get where he is today. That is probably an oversimplification. So I bet, in addition to being born rich, he did at least few other things right.

In order for a bill to become law, the President needs to sign it. Stacking bills is a euphemism for accumulating a lot of money, but an additional meaning could be bragging at how many laws were passed/impact on the nation. Bill is also his name.\n\n2) **Impeach Me** The Republican held House of Representatives impeached Bill Clinton for lying about his affair and interfering with the investigation.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton\n\n3) **Head of State** The President is the Head of State meaning they are the official representative of the United States to other countries and are expected to host other heads of state. Also likely refers to Monica Lewinsky allegedly giving Bill Clinton a blow job (head) in the White House.\n\n4) **First Lady (Second Hoe)** Hilary was the First Lady, but other women were in his life. I actually think a better title would've been First Lady (6th Hoe) or some other variation to reflect Bill Clinton's perceived reputation as a womanizer\n\n5) **The Fifth (I Plead) ft. 2Termz** The fifth amendment to the constitution is protection from self-incrimination, meaning a person can refuse to answer questions that might make them seem guilty. May also just be as simple as the 5th track.\n\n6) **Budget Cuts (Bush & Barack Diss)** Bill Clinton oversaw a large budget surplus during his second term whereas George Bush and Barack Obama have overseen deficit spending. Technically Congress holds greater responsibility for the budget, but you could see this as bragging about how poorly the other two presidents manage their money.\n\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/\n\n7) **Capitol Punishment** Capitol Punishment refers to the death sentence. Besides Washington DC being the capitol of the nation, I don't really see any additional meaning.\n\n8) **M-O-N-I-C-A** Would be interesting to see what the acronym Monica stands for, but reference to Lewinsky again.\n\n9) **Electoral Tokes (Green Party)** During the campaign Bill Clinton was asked if he smoked marijuana. His response was that he never inhaled, but in 1992 that was a minor controversy. Electoral vote are what a President needs to get elected.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3wfm-pwH4k\n\n10) **Rogue Scholar Freestyle** Bill Clinton is famously a Rhodes Scholar, a prestigious award for students to travel and study at Oxford.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship\n\n11) **The White Hoes** A clever pun with the White House and all of the women that have claimed Bill Clinton had an affair with them (all white I think).\n\n12) **Sixteen-Hunnid Bars** Probably a reference to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the address to the White House.\n\n13) **Spare Change Freestyle (Barack Diss)** Obama's main campaign slogan was \"Change You Can Believe In\"\n\n14) **Put Me On (Tha Hundred Dolla Bill)** Seems like straight forward wordplay with Hundred Dollar Bill Clinton, laws, or money. Bill Clinton also does give a significant amount of speeches to audiences so that could also be a reference.\n\nCorrect any of this if it is wrong or feel free to add.", "id": "d5it0np"}, {"comment": "Lol even though like I said I understood some refrences I appreciate you breakin it down real good, especially the ones I didnt know.

Obviously not all people get upset about it, but some do.  That's enough to make it something I don't want to talk about.\n\nAs a father of a mixed child, I worry about what struggles she'll face. Her mother's community won't treat her as one of their own(they are 1st generation immigrants.) She might expect me to have a parallel community as her mother, but there is no equal. I hope she can understand why and not feel alienated. Kind of like feeling rejected by a group of people who don't exist. \n\nAnyway thanks for sharing your experience.

It's unfair to use the term \"white guys\" because it includes plenty of white guys who are sympathetic to minorities. We shouldn't lump them all together.\n\nYou might notice that people tend to mainly call out racism when the person making the racist statement is white. A black person might say something racist, and people will usually voice disapproval but not to the same amount they would if it was a white person saying that. That might seem unfair but there's a good reason for it.\n\nWhite people make up 80% of America, and the vast majority of people who control entry into desirable institutions are white. That is almost everyone who in charge of making decisions like hiring, or who gets admitted to a college, or who gets cast for a movie are white. Your boss is probably white. The cop that pulls you over is probably white. So when white people are racist it affects us to a far greater degree than when non-whites are racist. I mean what institutions are controlled by mainly black people? You could maybe argue the NBA or the hip hop industry but even that is very debatable. What institutions are controlled by mainly Asians or Indians? Maybe a few tech companies here and there but it's still rare for Asians/Indians to be in positions of authority.\n\nI mean this is why it's such a meme for people to sarcastically say that \"only white people can be racist.\" No reasonable person actually believes that only white people can be racist. But in terms of prioritizing, it goes a lot further to call out and criticize white people for being racist.\n\nBecause of all this I actually believe that in America white people are probably the best at being accepting of race. It's just that even if only 30% of white people are racist, that's more racist white people than there are of all other minority groups combined.\n\nThe other part of that is that racism isn't an on/off switch. It's very rare that somebody is just a straight up racist. A lot of the racism that we're struggling with these days is subconscious racism. And I believe that almost everybody is at least a little racist in their subconscious.

An electromagnetic field tells you how a charged particle will behave at a certain point in an area, and the wave equation just tells you how certain areas in the field change over time.

So just as physical objects are made up of microscopic atoms bouncing around, light itself can be thought of as many individual little packets of light flying around bouncing off stuff, being absorbed, etc. These little packets of light are called photons.\n\nNow way back in the 1800s a dude name Maxwell figured out how to describe light also as acting like a wave, too, even though it was sometimes observed to act like a bunch of particles. An ocean wave is a wave in water. Light, it turns out, is a wave in the electromagnetic field. An electromagnetic field is just an area where at every point, electric and magnetic forces will act on an electrically charged particle in a certain way. The \"field\" is kind of like what strength and direction of those forces will be at that point in space. And so light could be thought of as just a \"wave\" through that field. A little more abstract yeah, because now instead of water being disturbed you have quantities at a point in space being disturbed. But it still produces an observable thing, namely light. This is what is sometimes referred to as the \"be-able\" of the field, that is after you have done all the math, what will it \"be\"? What will it look like? The \"be-able\" is light, or maybe you say the \"be-able\" is a charged particle moving in a certain way.\n\nNow it turns out all elementary particles have this \"wave-particle duality\" property. Photons, electrons, neutrons, quarks...all of them, sometimes are observed to act like waves and sometimes act like particles. So Schrodinger decided to come up with an equation for the \"wave\" that could apply to the properties of any particle, not just light. He made an educated guess that kept the general structure of Maxwell's equations, but had different quantities filled in, including complex numbers, which do not exist in the real world.  And it turned out that when you did basically the same thing to his equation that you did to Maxwell's equation, square the absolute value, it gave you a probability of a particle of that kind having a certain value. Just as Maxwell's equations, when manipulated in a similar way, they told you about the properties of light as a particle, and gave you probabilities about how many particles would do what. \n\nYou might be thinking, well, okay you have ocean waves and electromagnetic waves, but what kind of wave does the Schrodinger equation describe? That's the thing nobody really knows. It tells you the probability of a property for a particle when manipulated appropriately...but what is the \"wave\" moving through? We know it's described by numbers, and particularly by numbers that don't seem to exist in the real observable world. At best we can say the medium of the wave is something like \"probability field\". We don't know what the \"be-able\" of this probability field, or maybe it is more accurate to say, all the properties of all particles are the \"be-able\" of the probability field, since the Schrodinger equation can apply to any particle. \n\nSince the Schrodinger equation makes accurate predictions, most scientists aren't much bothered by what the \"be-able\" is, in fact, some say there is no point in even thinking about that. And so for decades, scientists have been generally satisfied with not knowing what the equation \"means.\" In science, accurate predictions provide the only meaning one can have. So they leave it alone. But some scientists have over the years offered various interpretations of what it means, and the jury is still out.", "id": "cxuifzr"}, {"comment": "Math is hard", "id": "cxug9qq"}, {"comment": "This sounds like both the dumbest and most amazing class ever ", "id": "cxubpvd"}, {"comment": "Its hard to teach something no one actually understands yet", "id": "cxuch7s"}, {"comment": "Why is it taught?

Then I learn from one of my boys, she got together with the person she cheated on her ex with but they broke up because she slept with another guy. She slept with a further two people I think. I'm still salty because this girl wasn't just flirting with me; she was on some mad pda shit sitting on my thing, inappropriate touching etc... but all I ever got was a kiss on the cheek.

That means recovery by the plaintiff is reduced in proportion to the plaintiff's fault in causing the injury. Maintaining an enclosure that is so compromised as to allow a four year old to easily enter into it sounds much more negligent to me than whatever the mother did. Though, it would probably depend on whether the enclosure was set up like similar enclosures of most other zoos of comparable size.\n\nMaybe the zoo could bring a claim for trespass to land, but a child's liability is almost never imputed to the parent. So that's probably a non-starter.\n\nThe zoo is much more likely to be liable for negligence as a host for failing to remedy the dangerous condition on their premises (the breach in the enclosure). There's also probably an argument that this was an attractive nuisance, which would make the zoo almost strictly liable if the child suffered some harm. But it doesn't look like anyone besides the zoo suffered any damages, so there would be no point in bringing such a claim.\n\nThis is an unfortunate situation, but it probably doesn't have any legal ramifications unless the child was injured, or the child or an onlooker manifests physical symptoms as a result of the emotional distress they experienced because of either the zoo's negligent maintenance of the enclosure, which led to the shooting of the gorilla, or the shooting itself.", "id": "d3qvpvy"}, {"comment": "Well, it's intentions are a whole 'nother thing.

It allows whites to view themselves as\r\nunique and original, outside of socialization and unaffected by the relentless racial messages in the culture.

Another commenter replies and basically says \"FYI you got shadow banned for saying this.\" Dude gets banned from /r/me_irl. \n\nSo he comes into /r/bannedfromme_irl (heretofore called \"banned\") and tells his story, posts some screens. It struck me because I recalled seeing a mod of /r/me_irl literally do this same thing. So I looked through my comment history and sure enough there it was. A mod of /r/me_irl on /r/me_irl telling a commenter they were shadow banned in reply to their bannable comment. \n\nSo back over in the \"banned\" sub I posted a link to this mod's comment basically highlighting the hypocrisy that a random commenter gets banned for doing something a mod had done a couple months earlier. \n\nThe mod comment stayed up and the /r/me_irl mods were silent. \n\nBasically my call-out comment jumped to the top of the thread and I believe even got posted on some of the aggregator subs like srd and bestof. The brigading was real. \n\nSo the /r/me_irl mods bitched a ton to the admins and sure enough the evidence was there. People were coming from the \"banned\" sub, some creating new accounts to circumvent their /r/me_irl bans and ripping into the hypocrite mod. So the admins banned the \"banned\" sub. \n\nI guess that's their prerogative. They have no policies that say you can't be a tucking cunt with how you run your community. But some of the stuff that happened in the wake of me calling that mod out were overtly against reddit site wide rules. To my knowledge, the \"banned\" mods didn't condone or participate in the brigading.

My inbox is full of angry people lol\n\n> To be fair tho, if a white person said they're pro white, they'd be labeled racist\n\nWhy is white pride seen as bad while our black pride is seen as good? There are two main reasons. The first, I believe, is the most important. Pride in your heritage and having white pride are not and never truly will be seen as the same thing. Having \u201cIrish Pride\u201d is not the same as having \u201cWhite pride.\u201d\n\nThe confusion comes in when people see \u201cBlack Pride\u201d and feel that the situation is unfair. As I\u2019ve stated before, the reason Black Pride and white Pride are not the same is sadly because the ability to trace your \u201cHeritage\u201d is very different for the two groups. A white person is much more likely to be able to trace their heritage, down to the letter, than a Black person is. Because many of our ancestors came here as mere cattle, we often have nothing more than a receipt. Tell me, when you bought your lawn mower, did you maintain the records of its creation, trace it\u2019s route to get to you and maintain a paper trail of the metals and parts used to create it in the first place? Not likely. That is how many Black people were entered into this country, as machinery.\n\nBecause of this, many of us know nothing more than\u2026\u201dBlack.\u201d\n\nWhite people on the other hand, are much more likely to know their heritage. Even those that don\u2019t know the names of their Grandmothers or Grandfathers can often tell you that they are Irish, German, Swiss, etc. This is where the very stark difference between Black pride and white pride can be found.\n\nA person saying they have pride in their Irish Heritage is never going to be seen the same way someone saying they have white pride will.

Deporting people isn't easy, it takes time, especially if you're trying to do it humanely. \n\nRefugees and legal immigrants are not a problem. The problem arises when you have a large amount of people waiting on deportation who can't work and don't have anything to do all day, with a few other factors (i.e. some Bosnians and Georgians coming through specifically to burgle, which is a problem). It's why as the pour of refugees (some legitimate, some not) slows down, crime numbers are evening back out to what they were. \n\nThis isn't a religion problem, it's not a culture problem, it's not a 'some races are just worse!' problem. It's something that has lead to a large increase in crime in every country ever: a very large group of people who just have no prospects and are waiting around. A great example is the explosion of hooliganism in England during the 80s, when you had, well, a bunch of people just hanging around because the economy was in the total shitter. It's a problem that goes all the way back to Ancient Rome and beyond.

Does that mean we should automatically assume if you're white that a black person is less intelligent than you? Should we put them in different schools?\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that you can cite statistics of crime and likelihood that an individual will do something all you want, but it doesn't really do us any good as a society.

I was a soldier in Iraq during the drawdown. EOF and Rules of Engagement(ROE) are the two most important issues a soldier deals with in a policing environment. Due to that I have a very keen respect for exactly what it means to police a community.   \n\nEOF is a way of working up an entire chain of different stages (voice signaling, hand signaling visual/audible warning, less than lethal means, lethal means) before lethal means(I.e.guns) are used. Of course, I can skip steps if need be, but the important part is that the appropriate amount of force is applied in any given situation. \n\nI am also aware of the training that is compressed into a police academy class situation. It's much the same as military boot camp. A LOT of information all at once. Here in lies one major concern dealing with this topic.  Cops are taught how to immediately suppress an escalating situation without being taught how to try and de-escalate things first. \n\n*Quick zap with a tazer in the back in a completely controlled environment while two buddies lower you onto a padded mat* \"So it's basically like that except for an extended period of time.  Good job. Now go to the next station.\"\n\nIn the military you are held to such a high degree of responsibility that even under the orders of a 4 star general and threat of death, your own moral decisions determine your legal fate. EOF is hammered into your head because as a military power that engaged in a quite a few conflicts, we know the price of collateral damage and misuse of force. \n\nGoing overseas soldiers hear horror stories of going to Leavenworth, which is the U.S. Military prison. Adding to that, there's frankly no motivation to be overbearing or overly aggressive. No good comes from that. We don't need to fill up our spare barracks with prisoners and we don't need a judicial after action review. It's a scary thing to think about.  Hell, if you run a camel over in Kuwait you're legally obligated to pay for it and its potential offspring even if you were in a military convoy.  So when you do have to make a decision normally you are motivated to de-escalate the situation as much as possible, because you fill like your ass is constantly on the line. No pun intended. \n\nThe reason EOF is not used properly by our police force is because they have no motivation to use it properly. They are motivated monetarily to police you by their own rules.  Legislation like civil asset forfeiture has taken away the moral motivation that used to be associated with police officers. See [Peelian Principles, Policed by consent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles). \n\nRelevant text:\n&gt;In this model of policing, police officers are regarded as citizens in uniform. They exercise their powers to police their fellow citizens with the implicit consent of those fellow citizens. \"Policing by consent\" indicates that the legitimacy of policing in the eyes of the public is based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so.[5]\n\nThis is not how we are policed now. Essentially they are taught in a quick rundown style of how to go to through the motions without learning the reasoning behind each motion. Which saves their ass on paper but applied in some particular context, just doesn't make any moral sense. This extinguishes the very reason they are employed as officers. \n\nThe training is just a means to an end, which is you(the civilian) being completely submissive to the officer in any situation. Even if you're the victim. Even if under blind dominance. Even if under complete and utter lack of any civilized Justice. \n\nFor instance its not ok to hit an old lady with a baton just because that's your normal first course of action when someone doesn't get on the ground. But on paper the only thing that matters to the bureaucrats is that she didn't get on the ground. It's also not ok to taze a subdued individual just because they are allegedly/apparently \"resisting\" or \"noncompliant\" but you did lean out of the car. The only person who heard the exchange was you and the rookie. It basically never took place.\n\nThis type of behavior has lead to a despicable misuse of force on the part of the U.S. Police force.  Police officers and their direct superiors are personally profiting off the systematic churning of our civilians through the judicial process which is fed by a self fulfilling prophecy. [Civil Asset Forfeiture](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/asset-forfeiture-abuse), prison system expansion and domination of the civilian population is the intrinsic goal of our judicial system now.  \n \n\nEdit: I find it funny that the only people who had an issue with this post were all cops.\"\n", "id": "d5367cx"}, {"comment": "My understanding that there wasn't a universal mandate to track that stat prior to some year, which is why that prior to 2009 number is so misleading.

Or is his income tax thing like Romney's where he isnt paid an \"income\" thats very large but instead gets a massive bonus that is treated differently by the irs?\n\nI know one of the arguments one of his people made was that \"he\" paid taxes for payroll and sich but isnt that something that comes exclusively from the company and not himself?  \n\nIs his ability to claim the losses for a personal income tax credit because the shares of the company that he owns as CEO/member lost value?", "id": "d8e5nva"}, {"comment": "I don't know enough about his organization to give a definitive answer. He operates an LLC, which I've noted and is easy to source: his Bloomberg page says as much\n\nIn some cases an the ''natural person' that formed the LLC would use the companies filing as their own. Based of the way he's being criticized this seems to be the case, but I haven't verified it for certain. \n\nIt seems he's the sole proprietor of about 500 companies, which means that he doesn't have share holders. His bankruptcies appear to be linked to rapidly changing rates in the bond market in the 90s.\n\nIf you are raising money for a business you can either issue bonds or issue shares of stocks.\n\nBonds are supposed to be a guaranteed stream of income from a business, but have no voting rights. You might tell an investor Give me 100K now and I'll give you $100 a year for 30 years and then I'll give you the 100K back. Its a lock for the investor *unless the business goes bankrupt.*\n\nIf you issue common stocks/shares you are giving voting rights to your shareholders in return for their money. Voting rights gives them the power to elect or remove people from the board, among others privileges. They can trade the shares on stock market for financial gains and losses and make money that way, or they can hope the company pays dividends. A company is not compelled to issue dividends.\n\nThen there is preferred stock, which is a mix of bonds and common stock. No voting rights, the dividends are semi-guaranteed. If a dividend is issued it has to meet the running obligation of the preferred stock holders before the common stock holders get any. Preferred stock can build dividends in arrears. \n\nThat's my best shot of describing how I think his business works.", "id": "d8e70f9"}, {"comment": "Issue me some bongs (nice post btw.)

Pulled up in a jacked up truck, gun rack in the truck with guns, etc. Usually dudes from the country would throw hands before pulling a gun but still, ain't worth it over some meet me booty. He ended up calling his best friend who was like, call the white boy so then he called me. Drove me ass like an hour there to get his dumb ass.

Aka feelin like a bitch but it's funny and it works better than me doing shit. \nI got with this light skinned girl who was bad as fuck. both parents were black. They fucking hated me. Would say shit like I don't want you dating a white boy and im just sitting on the couch like, fuck. Alright. Idk what to say so ima shut my mouth. Dudes in school were hating bad. Back then, racial tension in school was always high. I'm 27 now. This was in middle school. I didn't care about all the hate I was getting because they were just talking at this point. But I got shit from both the white side and the black side and the Mexicans usually just cracked jokes at both the whites and blacks with me as their center, but never said anything bad about me. Usually along the lines of black man can't please their women so they getting white boys and white girls can't please their men so they jumping to black girls and a bunch of other shit. Mostly dumb shit but whatever, 2 sides hating is enough. \n\nOne day someone comes up and starts saying shit to my face. We get into and and fight. No real winner but of course I lost to them. Whatever. I'm hot though cuz I'm young and dumb. Dude gets the message to me we can have a rematch. Tells me to meet him in the locker room after gym. The whole time In gym we're both talkin shit. Im Surprised it didn't pop off in there. After class I'm the first one in the locker room. Usually it's a sea of people but this time I'm the only white boy in the whole room. I already knew what was going down. 10th Street jumps everybody. That's how we were raised. He didn't want to take any more bruises or lose any more blood even though the fight we had we were both bloody and banged up. I won't lie, that first fight was a good fight. Shit was fun and nobody jumped in except to break us up before they let the teachers thru so nobody got suspended. We broke cameras before we fought so they never saw shit. \n\nAnyway, I knew I was about to get my ass fucked up. He said some shit like, what you wanna say now, ain't talkin shit now huh? Fuck no mother fucker, I'm trying to find the exit and catch you another time. So I did the only thing I could do and hit whoever I could and plowed they the crowd takin hit after hit. I was taller than most kids. I'm 6'2, 200 pounds now. I was probably 5'10 or so then. Idk, been a long time ago. As I was making my way thru the crowd bleeding like crazy, I felt someone grab me up and pull me to the side Of the wall. Though racial tension was high it wasn't like my friends stopped being friends. They were there too but knew fighting wasn't gonna solve shit in there. So the 3 of them got me out and it ended there for the time being. Had to go to the nurse and shit. \n\nAnyway to end this quicker, I had my people go with me to meet this dude at his mom's house after school. He got on MySpace and the phone and had some people meet up so he knew for a fact he wouldn't get jumped. He wasn't about to try to jump me again though. His mom said he better handle this like a man or she's gonna beat his ass herself lmao. Yall know how that goes. His momma coaching him on got him feeling powerful. But I'm heated, I'm making sure you look like you got jumped. It was a other good fight and the next day his face was fucked. Mine was already kinda fucked from getting jumped but I've always been hard to fuck up. Never been knocked out, I've been jumped way worse, including when I got jumped into GD when I was in boy school for 2 years shortly after all this happened. Been hit with a bat a few times. Only once in the head tho, didn't go down. Was stabbed with a mother fucking fire poker. The thing with the hook on the side and the pointy edge. Fucking thing went into my neck right next to my jugular and some main shit I guess, and the pointy part got me on my face damn near on my ear. Like, right where the top of your ear is in your face. Thought he punched me until I saw a chick freaking out and saw blood squirting out my fucking neck. For real thought I was gonna die. Fucking faggots uncle was a cop, he called him and got completely out of it the cop tried arresting me and my people cuz of some bullshit and said if we talked we were going down too. So being like 18 at the time I didn't push it. Didn't know better. Idk why the mother fucker brought a god damn fire poker to a fight any fucking way. Preppy white boy idea for sure. They were just mad my buddy stole dudes bitch and we're trying to jump him. \n\nI'm rambling way too much. A little fucked up. The last bit I meant to say was how I handle it now. Every black girl who fucks with white boys is for sure gonna say something when someone's talking shit about it. Before I tried to be all hard and stand up for myself. Now I let her say every damn thing she feels like and make sure their feelings are hurt cuz she's gonna say some cold blooded shit. If they shut up which mostly happens then I don't worry about it. Naturally if they say some dumb shit to her then I say something. Kind of a bitch move to let your lady clown on em but it's effective and keeps my ass from fighting too much.

I also made sure to clown every chance I had. Told my baby momma she should fuck some more of my friends, It got me a nice TV and some games and shit. Just typical shit really.

Really done up chick that will cry easily but isn't really that upset she just can't help it, good chance she does anal.\n\nIn my experience, white girls are either boring as fuck or straight freaks, more so than any others. Younger chick's are boring. Chick's in their mid to late 20s are usually a bit more open, knowledgeable and know what they want. Bad bitches usually don't try as hard and are high maintenance, average chick's are usually the best all around. Bigger girls, like thick chick's, are usually try hards. They'll do whatever and give the best head. I cant remember exactly how the saying goes, but marry down never frown, except I heard it differently originally or the song from the 60s that says \n\n\"If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life, Never make a pretty woman your wife. So from my personal point of view, Get an ugly girl to marry you.\"\n\n The songs \"If You Wanna Be Happy\" by Jimmy Soul. \n\nAnyway, that shit only goes so far though. Life makes em who they are. They're stereotypes which usually have a little bit of truth in them but are by no means guides. My buddy is average and doesn't make the best money ever. He's got probably the hottest girl out of any one of us, she's super chill, is an amazing wife and they never really fight. But he's an amazing dude too. He treats her right and she treats him right back. I'm not the greatest looking dude but I'm decent. I've got game and can make them laugh and know when to approach and all that shit. Most of the women \"out of my league\" I've been with said they didn't really look at me like that until they talked to me. I was cute but there were cuter. I just make sure I get a chance and go from there. I also learned the hard way how to be a good boyfriend since I spent some time in boy school from 14 to 16 then 6 months house arrest, then went straight to acting a fool and skipping relationships.
