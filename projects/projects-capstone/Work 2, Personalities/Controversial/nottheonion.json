In 1992-3, at the height of the AIDS epidemic, the European Commission was obliged to set a common European standard for condoms that, inter alia, required setting standard dimensions, thus establishing a size for the average European male member that condoms are intended to fit.\nAt the time, all member states agreed on a length of 152 millimeters, but the Italians objected that the proposed girth of 55mm was too large, suggesting not more than 54mm. This intervention took place in a midweek hearing in Brussels and was met with incredulity, laughter \u2013 the story then circulated in various in-house newsletters of EU staff by that Friday and was reported many in many ribald press articles around Europe over the weekend (often conjoining the words \u201cItalian,\u201d \u201clovers,\u201d \u201clothario\u201d and \u201csmall.\u201d) The following week the Italians withdrew their objections, anecdotally blaming the Commission\u2019s interpreters\u2019 \u201coutrageous\u201d mistranslation of the Italian representative\u2019s statement for the \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d\nYears after EN 600 was adopted, the issue was apparently revived as Germany asserted that the condom size adopted was about 20% too large, arguing that earlier surveys had been incorrect because the male participants had mostly lied. This issue appears to have not been seriously pressed by German authorities, perhaps because of the bemused commentary it would likely attract\n                                                          \nNope, European condoms are just based on self reported size.

And with a time-gap that wide, it's impossible for *anyone* to form a defense. \n\nMy family didn't take sides, thankfully. Parents paid for one of the best criminal defense attorneys in the county. Unfortunately, and I didn't find this out til later, turns out the attorney and the prosecuting attorney trying my case were golf buddies and went to college together, same frat. Now, I've no evidence or anything to go off of here, but I can't help but wonder if the PA asked my attorney for an \"easy win\", since...\n\n... My plea bargain, in a case that had zero evidence to convict me, her word against my own, was cop to guilty and get two 4th degree gross misdemeanor assault charges (Down from Rape of a Child I) and serve no jail time, and not be on any registry, with a chance to get it expunged in seven years (THIS year, actually). \n\nOr prison.\n\nI went with the deal because I was fucking stupid, terrified, and thought I could trust my attorney.

Recently I was prevented from having a family with my high school best friend of 12 years and her little girl because of the fear my past and priors would endanger her custody battle with her shitstain baby-daddy.\n\nWhy did my sister do this to me?\n\nBecause she got grounded, you see, grounded from her computer, her cellphone, seeing her friends outside of school, talking on the house phone, basically all forms of communication, when she was fifteen. One day, my mom heard her in her room talking to her neighbor friend via walkie-talkie, and my mom went ballistic on her. How did my sister deflect and keep herself from getting in MORE trouble and save herself from an ass-whipping?\n\nBy coming up with the most outlandish, most vile, most repugnant thing she could, and shifting the blame onto the family black sheep, me.\n\nFucking bitch. I still won't look her in the eye or acknowledge her presence during family events.

So many Caucasian people of means either a) can provide their kids with better opportunities, such as tutors and tend to have more free time to spend with their children, so they test in to more exclusive public schools (which is just a crazy system - basically the kids who are the most \"promising\" test into super exclusive public high schools, which end up being disproportionately white and children from families with money - these high schools are amazing and test well, while the rest of the city schools lag behind and are failing) or b) simply pull their kids out of public school and put them in private school. In my city the percentage of white kids in public school is way off versus the percentage of white people who live in the city as a whole.

The relevancy here being that what Christ's apostles taught universally is indeed as much a part of the Christian religion as what Christ taught in the Gospels, and that what the apostles taught can only agree with, extrapolate upon, etc. what Christ taught. After all, St John ends his gospel by explicitly stating that it doesn't address everything Christ taught. So, what the apostles taught and believed is not proof of anything *from a \"society believed x so x must be true\" standpoint* but to prove a) it's as much a part of Christian dogma as explicit teachings from Christ in the gospel and B) to illustrate that it's silly to claim Christ was OK with sodomy when all of his disciples, historians, contemporaries, etc, who accurately represent him in every regard, clearly treat sodomy as an evil. \n\nI need to stop posting from my phone. \n\n", "id": "d1dbxfq"}, {"comment": "Yes, he did actually.

Shows that the South wasn't afraid to use federal gov't and that the divide wasn't all about states' rights as some people claim\n\nLate 1850's, tense border skirmishes between pro-slavery and anti-slavery states, notably between pro-slave Missouri and free-ish Kansas. Idea of popular sovereignty introduced, in which a state could vote on the legality of slavery when entering the union.\n\n1860. Abe Lincoln elected president, rich southerners feared for the right to own slaves (which was unwarranted, Lincoln said he wouldn't touch slavery laws where they already were. Even though he was personally against slavery, he was pragmatic and realized what could happen.)\n\n1861. S Carolina's slaveowners believed that their rights to own slaves and economic interests were being threatened by the industrialized north. S Carolina seceded in January, the other states soon followed, forming the CSA. S Carolina attacks the federal fort in Charleston Harbor, Ft. Sumter, signaling the start of the war. Poor, white southerners follow leadership of the wealthy plantation owners, even though the plantation owners' slaves directly hurt the poor white farmers economically by out competing with cheaper labor. (Kind of reminds me of something happening today.)  Abraham Lincoln, federal gov't believed that you couldn't just leave the Union whenever a state wanted, which could severely weaken the nation and be a dangerous precedent and for other states. The United States stood as the only continuous democracy at the time, and Abe Lincoln also believed in Democracy. A split to the Union could show weakness in democracy. The south brings along with it most of the elite officers, leaving the north without much military leadership. The 1st Battle of Bull Run occurs, showing that the war wouldn't be over quickly.\n\nWar- Washington DC turned into a fortress, as right across the river was the most powerful southern state, Virginia, and was surrounded land-wise by the slave state and border state but not confederate state of Maryland. Massive amounts of US troops also required to man forts on the Western Frontier against natives. The bloodiest war fought in US history, much more massive in scale than other conflicts at the time, such as the Franco-Prussian war. The N didn't actually have as much of the popularly believed advantage, numerically speaking, because it had to fight against the natives as well as the south while also having to commit troops to occupy captured territory. Some in N called for peace, making a quick victory that much more important. N came up with the Anaconda Plan, in which the northern navy would rapidly increase production and \"strangle\" the South's primary source of income: cotton. Northern leadership constantly being replaced due to poor performance. On the western front (Mississippi  River valley area,) not far west,) Ulysses S Grant, a former poor general store clerk and future president, continuously wins battles. The South's Robert E Lee was regarded as the best general, at the time, constantly winning for the south in the East. Ulysses S Grant promoted to the head general of the US army. Lincoln passed the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing slaves in the south (even though he didn't control it) and allowed the enlistment of black soldiers. Southern army invaded the northern state of Pennsylvania to attempt to make northerners sue for peace. A small confrontation with Calvary ended up snowballing into the largest and most important battle of the war: Gettysburg. A southern victory meant the north would likely give up next election cycle and the country would be split. The north barely won the battle, with huge losses on both sides. With the South's invasion repelled, the north would eventually cut huge swaths of territory through the south, destroying the southern economy in order to stop war production. \n \n1865, Lee outsmarted by Grant. S Armies surrender, leaving the north victorious. Slavery abolished nationwide. Technological advancements became abundant due to the war effort. The US's economy catapulted to the largest in the world not longer after the war, and federal gov't established that any act of secession would be illegal and force would be used, if necessary  \n\nHoly shit that took a long time to write\n\nWow, thanks for the gold!

In \"the killer angels\" (historical fiction) a comment is made about how the North gets all the best students from West Point.  I would agree that the North had a run of terrible generals commanding the army of the potomac and that eventually it was shown that the south had better leadership, but it was not believed at the outset that there was a leadership deficit in the North.  Sherman and Grant were highly effective.\n\n2) the north didn't have as much popularly believed advantage - I'd say this is a huge stretch. Money, people, industry, larger Navy are huge trump cards in war.  The south did have some advantages in fighting on home soil defensively, and only needing to draw out the war, not necessarily win it, but these are small compared the advantages of the North.\n\n3) Lee outsmarted by grant - not to take anything away from Grant, he fought the obvious war that the army of the Potomac should have fought all along. When you have vastly superior numbers and superior arms you press your enemy with the full might of your Army. But it was more of a case of crushing the enemy than of outsmarting the enemy.

But then I remembered how articles tend to butcher out all the details. \n\nHere's the [actual paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142200)\n\n>we describe and examine three new theoretical accounts of geek culture related to the cultural trends above, which we refer to as the **great fantasy migration hypothesis**, the **belongingness hypothesis**, and the **desire for engagement hypothesis**. These theoretical accounts are not considered to be mutually exclusive\u2014participation in geek culture is almost certainly determined by multiple factors and several of these hypotheses share predictions. This research is designed to be the first rather than last word on these hypotheses.\n\nOf the three, narcissism is touched upon in the great fantasy migration hypothesis.\n\n>n US society, inflated self-esteem and narcissism\u2014which have increased steadily over the past few generations\u2014are being met with a harsh reality of low youth employment and high debt loads [6,12,13]. Separate from Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), narcissism is a normal personality trait characterized by a grandiose sense of self as well as efforts to maintain that sense of self in the face of reality [14]. Narcissists can be charismatic [15], confident [16], or even emerge as effective leaders [17], but when faced with failure or criticism, narcissists tend to protect their sense of self through such strategies as discrediting the source of the criticism [18] and withdrawing from challenging tasks in favor of easier routes to self-enhancement [19]. In the United States, narcissism has been increasing since the 1970\u2019s, while traditional ways of supporting narcissism such as prestigious jobs and credit (e.g., the debt bubble collapse) are becoming less viable for the majority of Americans. The result for individuals is discomfort (or cognitive dissonance [20]) with the incongruence between inflated sense of self and deflated reality [13]. One solution for resolving this dissonance is to migrate into a fantasy world via role playing games, fandoms, and fantasy media. These hobbies present opportunities for living out a grandiose self (e.g., by role playing a powerful or charismatic character) that might not be possible in the non-fantasy world. And, of course, in some cases success in fantasy (e.g., tournament gaming, achieving cosplay fame) can lead to real world success. In addition, it is easier to obtain expert status and admiration for one\u2019s knowledge of geek subjects (e.g., Star Trek trivia) because credentials such as education and certification are not required. Thus, narcissistic individuals who are unable to receive the admiration and praise to which they feel entitled (whether because of failure, or because their grandiose fantasy is impossible to live out in the real world) may turn to a fantasy world where such praise is more easily obtained.\n\n>If the great fantasy migration hypothesis is correct, we should see a correlation between narcissism and participation in geek culture, and perhaps more strongly to the more roleplaying and immersive elements of geek culture. We should also see higher levels of fantasy proneness, a personality trait associated with elevated fantasizing and magical beliefs [21], among individuals engaged in geek culture. Fantasy proneness can be defined as a tendency to have intense daydreams, to have difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, and to have magical or pseudoscientific beliefs. Although fantasy proneness has typically been associated with dysfunction, recent work has shown it to have two factors: a factor associated with strong imagery and strange beliefs and a factor associated with daydreaming and enjoyment of fantasy [22]. While the former factor is associated with dysfunction, the latter is not. Thus, normally occurring levels of fantasy proneness may positively predict geek engagement even in normally functioning individuals. Finally, to the extent that individuals participate in geek culture we should see reduced civic engagement and less engagement in real life goals, such as career aspirations and raising a family, as these would likely be less viable sources of praise and esteem and thus would be less rewarding to narcissists than geek culture activities.\n\ntl;dr: Narcissists can be fully functioning parts of society, but what happens when they are confronted with failure/criticism? Narcissism has been on the rise in the U.S. since the 1970s. The Dream ideal of getting a prestigious job is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. This results in cognitive dissonance. So what may individuals do when confronted with failure/criticism? Turn to a fantasy world where praise/success is more easily obtained."], [74, "ITT: people confirming the notion"], [73, "Look at how angry all these narcissists are when they get called out....smh"], [55, "Everyone in this thread is so special"], [55, "wow reddit's gonna love this"], [48, "#"], [36, "> The research was conducted across 2,354 people attending a science fiction and fantasy convention in Georgia.\n\nGee, I wonder which fire-breathing reptile-based convention THAT could be.\n\nI wouldn't call this study terribly surprising though.

Without the explosion of geek culture in recent years, Star Wars wouldn't be nearly as mainstream as it is.\n\nThat being said, the linked study is a rather interesting read as far as studies go and you two are exhibiting a pretty good example of the belongingness hypothesis outlined in the study.

This shows some basic disconnection between the scientists and their objects of study. This is a huge problem in social sciences and something that really always has to be looked at carefully.\n\n3) This is meta-analysis. Meta is nice in hard sciences, but in social ones it is extremely unreliable, to the point of rarely being relevant. It is an ever-present problem in all fields of science where even when everything is documented thoroughly, still the results are possibly unreproducible. \n\n4) **The range of \"geek culture\" from \"posting on Reddit\", through \"creative writing\", towards \"theater\" and \"independent films\", taking a sharp turn to \"paganism\" and ending even on \"BDSM\" and \"polyamorism\".** This is casting so wide a net, I expect there to be references to studies which show the number of narcissists in a random group of people. Not only that, but there are so many radically different interests and aforementioned wide net, that there comes a question - is it just that people who actively pursue any interests more likely to be narcissists compared to those that prefer a life of work/home with family only; or have hobbies which don't include any kind of creative aspect or participation - being passive observers? \n\n5) Furthermore, most of the studies are self-reported. It's not a stereotype for no reason that \"geeks\" and \"nerds\" are shy and asocial. It is less so nowadays due to, well, **these interests not being obscure anymore** and a large pool of people taking part, but even so, guess who would be more likely to participate - outgoing, charismatic, social people. As such - more likely to be narcissists.\n\n6) Does not help that a good part are also online surveys.

But then I remembered how articles tend to butcher out all the details. \n\nHere's the [actual paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142200)\n\n>we describe and examine three new theoretical accounts of geek culture related to the cultural trends above, which we refer to as the **great fantasy migration hypothesis**, the **belongingness hypothesis**, and the **desire for engagement hypothesis**. These theoretical accounts are not considered to be mutually exclusive\u2014participation in geek culture is almost certainly determined by multiple factors and several of these hypotheses share predictions. This research is designed to be the first rather than last word on these hypotheses.\n\nOf the three, narcissism is touched upon in the great fantasy migration hypothesis.\n\n>n US society, inflated self-esteem and narcissism\u2014which have increased steadily over the past few generations\u2014are being met with a harsh reality of low youth employment and high debt loads [6,12,13]. Separate from Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), narcissism is a normal personality trait characterized by a grandiose sense of self as well as efforts to maintain that sense of self in the face of reality [14]. Narcissists can be charismatic [15], confident [16], or even emerge as effective leaders [17], but when faced with failure or criticism, narcissists tend to protect their sense of self through such strategies as discrediting the source of the criticism [18] and withdrawing from challenging tasks in favor of easier routes to self-enhancement [19]. In the United States, narcissism has been increasing since the 1970\u2019s, while traditional ways of supporting narcissism such as prestigious jobs and credit (e.g., the debt bubble collapse) are becoming less viable for the majority of Americans. The result for individuals is discomfort (or cognitive dissonance [20]) with the incongruence between inflated sense of self and deflated reality [13]. One solution for resolving this dissonance is to migrate into a fantasy world via role playing games, fandoms, and fantasy media. These hobbies present opportunities for living out a grandiose self (e.g., by role playing a powerful or charismatic character) that might not be possible in the non-fantasy world. And, of course, in some cases success in fantasy (e.g., tournament gaming, achieving cosplay fame) can lead to real world success. In addition, it is easier to obtain expert status and admiration for one\u2019s knowledge of geek subjects (e.g., Star Trek trivia) because credentials such as education and certification are not required. Thus, narcissistic individuals who are unable to receive the admiration and praise to which they feel entitled (whether because of failure, or because their grandiose fantasy is impossible to live out in the real world) may turn to a fantasy world where such praise is more easily obtained.\n\n>If the great fantasy migration hypothesis is correct, we should see a correlation between narcissism and participation in geek culture, and perhaps more strongly to the more roleplaying and immersive elements of geek culture. We should also see higher levels of fantasy proneness, a personality trait associated with elevated fantasizing and magical beliefs [21], among individuals engaged in geek culture. Fantasy proneness can be defined as a tendency to have intense daydreams, to have difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, and to have magical or pseudoscientific beliefs. Although fantasy proneness has typically been associated with dysfunction, recent work has shown it to have two factors: a factor associated with strong imagery and strange beliefs and a factor associated with daydreaming and enjoyment of fantasy [22]. While the former factor is associated with dysfunction, the latter is not. Thus, normally occurring levels of fantasy proneness may positively predict geek engagement even in normally functioning individuals. Finally, to the extent that individuals participate in geek culture we should see reduced civic engagement and less engagement in real life goals, such as career aspirations and raising a family, as these would likely be less viable sources of praise and esteem and thus would be less rewarding to narcissists than geek culture activities.\n\ntl;dr: Narcissists can be fully functioning parts of society, but what happens when they are confronted with failure/criticism? Narcissism has been on the rise in the U.S. since the 1970s. The Dream ideal of getting a prestigious job is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. This results in cognitive dissonance. So what may individuals do when confronted with failure/criticism? Turn to a fantasy world where praise/success is more easily obtained.", "id": "cyb56ly"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cyb5jg5"}], [{"comment": "ITT: people confirming the notion", "id": "cyb580j"}], [{"comment": "Look at how angry all these narcissists are when they get called out....smh", "id": "cyb4caz"}, {"comment": "ITT: \n\nTHIS IS BULLSHIT IT DOESNT MAKE ME A NARCISSIST IF I ACTUALLY AM BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE ESPECIALLY THE STUPID OUT OF TOUCH IDIOTS WHO WROTE THIS", "id": "cybaruk"}], [{"comment": "Everyone in this thread is so special", "id": "cyb5enl"}], [{"comment": "wow reddit's gonna love this", "id": "cyb554l"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cyb5d9m"}], [{"comment": "#", "id": "cyb5oyr"}], [{"comment": "> The research was conducted across 2,354 people attending a science fiction and fantasy convention in Georgia.\n\nGee, I wonder which fire-breathing reptile-based convention THAT could be.\n\nI wouldn't call this study terribly surprising though.

In addition, we wanted to further validate geek engagement as a construct by testing whether it was observable to na\u00efve strangers. Studies have shown that outside observers can accurately perceive individual difference variables from photographs, [61] especially when the subject of the photograph has some control over the picture (e.g., pose, outfit, smile). If geek engagement is a valid construct, we can expect individuals higher in geek engagement to appear \u201cgeekier\u201d than individuals lower in geek engagement in photos. Therefore, we took a photograph of each participant to examine whether observers\u2019 perceptions of their appearance are consistent with their geek engagement score.

It was just him, a Tiffany lamp, and a smelting factory in that Silicon Valley apartment. During this process, Jobs and Wozniak used an early voice recognition system they stole from Xerox PARC. (A controversial statement, some say they \"borrowed\").\n\nBecause of the limited nature of the early voice transcriber, and the cacophony of noise from the metal refinement plant would whisper ones and zeros to Wozniak, who would then make whistling sounds indicating what number Jobs said. Some say that this makes Wozniak the read coder behind Apple ][, Mac OS, and the failed [Mac Bart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa). This is patently false, it was Jobs saying the ones and zeros while disposing of slag.

He then got fired by an increasingly conservative board who didn't cotton to his hippie ways like his all Fruity Pebbles diet.\n\nAfter landing a job at Pepsi Next and there was a period with something about POGs and messiah Bob Saget made everyone's House Full. Can't remember much.\n\nThen Apple hired him back, and Jobs used the secret blend of fructose from his old company to make new colors never seen by the human eye, just for Macs. Ever the environmentalist, the new Macs recycled NHL pucks for the mouses. Using an open source satan, he made some big cats which became Mac OS X. \n\nRumor has it Jobs himself threw up metal all over the first release of the OS. Probably on account of illness from the time he had a metal processing plant in his apartment a few decades before.\n\nFinally, Jobs opened the shoebox of iPhones he made by his own hand in the 1980's and started handing them out.

There is now so much invested in the current scientific paradigms that to reveal new ones would upset far more institutions than they would relieve.\n\nAnother less known example of this is the often cited \"critical thinking\" focus in education, but without a reference to formal logic, what is this? Often it truly is *propagandistic* in its assumption that certain *conclusions* are more valid than others regardless of the methods of arriving at them. The necessity of Intellectual courage is rarely taught, and as long as people toe the dominant ideological lines, they will not be bothered, even when sincere inquiries can lead them beyond it.\n\nAll of this leads to the fact that in a certain sense, much of our education system *does* constitute a \"what to think, not how to think\" that rightfully rouses suspicion.\n\nFor example:\n\n- [There is no single \"scientific method,\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/46huxx/how_do_we_know_if_the_information_we_get_from/d05f7y4) but this is taught everywhere.\n\n- [A political viewpoint interferes with our ability to do math](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/new-study-politics-makes-you-innumerate) when the results contradict our political beliefs, yet the emotional nature of reasoning is hardly ever addressed in a formal educational context. If you have the \"right\" opinion (i.e., the popular one among a powerful group) curiosity with regard to other answers and empathy for people who hold them tend to be seen as unnecessary. This makes intellectual pursuit fundamentalist and adversarial rather than mutual and arising from natural curiosity and desire for progress. (See /r/Festinger for more on this)\n\n- The word \"rational\" has been hijacked to mean \"agrees with me,\" rather than \"logically consistent given a set of maxims.\" It is incredible how much is called \"rational\" and \"rationalist\" that objectively defies the standards that give that word its elevated status. This indicates that people are more interested in *appearing* rational than *being* rational. What truly rational people must do is stand up to this.\n\n- Peer-review itself is called into serious doubt by none other than the [Chief Editors of the New England Journal of Medicine](http://www.globalresearch.ca/editor-in-chief-of-worlds-best-known-medical-journal-half-of-all-the-literature-is-false/5451305), among [others.](http://www.csicop.org/si/show/science_scientism_and_anti-science_in_the_age_of_preposterism)\n\n- Moreover, [suppression of dissent in science](http://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/#science) is a [documented phenomenon](http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/16hai/Delborne.html).\n\n- All in all, **it seems a substantial threat to intellectualism is mild intellectualism**, which strives to appear intellectual and gain many of its social rewards, but without practicing its principles, let alone yielding its results.\n\nPerhaps the worst thing about the \"anti-intellectualism movement\" is *the degree to which it is justified*, given the wide gulf between intellectualism and what is called intellectualism today.\n\n>*In any case, anti-intellectualism is not the creation of people who are categorically hostile to ideas. Quite the contrary: just as the most effective enemy of the educated man may be the half-educated man, so the leading anti-intellectuals are usually men deeply engaged with ideas, often obsessively engaged with this or that outworn or rejected idea.... These spokesmen are in the main neither the uneducated nor the unintellectual, but rather the marginal intellectuals, would-be intellectuals, unfrocked or embittered intellectuals, the literate leaders of the semi-literate, full of seriousness and high purpose about the causes that bring them to the attention of the world.*\n\n>--Douglas Hofstadter", "id": "d5lkeq0"}, {"comment": "Thanks for convincing me that intellectuals think way too much about being intellectuals ", "id": "d5ll5zh"}, {"comment": "No -- most people who call themselves intellectuals don't think nearly *enough* about what it means to be an intellectual.

Using General Relativity we can estimate how much mass there should be in particular areas. To keep the stars/clusters in the distribution we observe.\n\nOn the other hand, we can estimate the mass of said stars/galaxies by looking at how much light they emit and its spectral distribution. E.G. for a star to emit X amount of power in particular spectral lines it must have Y mass. \n\nThese two ways of estimating mass are essentially independent and it turns out that the amount of mass you estimate by looking at emission spectrum is quite a bit less than the amount of mass you estimate by applying GR to get a particular spatial distribution. This additional mass is \"dark\" (we don't see spectral signature of it) and we don't know exactly what it is made of.\n\nWe can model galaxies by taking into account the star weight + adding dark matter. To get in our models the spatial distribution in galaxies that we observe we must let the dark matter be distributed continuously throughout the galaxy (ie there is dark matter everywhere, it's not just concentrated all in the center). This suggests to scientists that there are particles of dark matter everywhere but they only interact via gravity and not via other processes (which is why we can't detect them easily on earth, since presumably they are everywhere on earth as well). \n\nThis experiment was aimed at trying to detect dark matter under the assumption that dark matter particles had some particular characteristics. It turns out that we didn't find dark matter particles in this experiment, but it doesn't change our view that there IS dark matter (since it's a astrophysical observation), simply a particular set of theories we had about dark matter are wrong. It is not particularly surprising that they are wrong since we know so little it would be unlikely that our early theories about something we don't know proved true.\n\nEdit: there are also some more exotic theories such as abundance of mid-sized black holes (this got additional attention in the media recently since LIGO experiment detected two mid-sized black holes merging), or that there is an abundance of cold brown-dwarves. There is a variety of reasons to think that these possibilities are unlikely, however, if they are true, then there is no dark matter on earth.", "id": "d5lkm2z"}, {"comment": "failed? ruling stuff out is important, they're working on big problems not looking for their keys", "id": "d5lkowd"}, {"comment": "It is significant news in the scientific world!

Heck, there are physicists who spend their entire careers working on \"null tests\" - improving the precision with which we measure things we're almost certain are zero. For instance, the physicists who are looking for the electric dipole moment of the neutron (which should be zero, as far as we know) know there's a minuscule chance that they will find a dipole moment. If they found one with significant statistics, that would be new physics!

(1) on its own isn't a problem as that sort of thing is what leads to major discoveries.

The lesson, though, was that elaborations on the standard theory could explain the empirical anomalies, but at the price of 'ad-hocness', while Einstein's theoretical insights leading to SR did the job much more naturally.

The school made you sign a contract that you couldn't get any of your money back, so it was too late to back out. They broke every promise that they advertised, made my class the guinea pigs for the 1 year program and cut out vital classes like restaurant rotation. They said there would never be more than 15 students per class. We never had less than 30. There was never enough product, cookware or production space. They even gave the culinary knife kits to the baking students and never bothered to fix the error so we had to supplement half our own things. To which we had chefs telling us we couldn't use any tools from home. So when one chef told us we'd be deboning fish with our fish tweezers, I spat back at him what tweezers? We didn't even have tourne or boning knives, since the bakers had our kits. That same chef told us we weren't Allowed to take any of the food we cooked home, or out of the classroom. So we either had to scarf down entire fish, rabbits, pots of stews, etc in the three minutes before cleanup or we had to throw it out. Keep in mind that every production day we made at least six different dishes. So that was a massive amount of waste, since there was never enough time to eat, even if we could eat that much at once. That entire system was just a huge scam. Even worse was the day we \"graduated\" they announced they were bringing back the associates degree, and always knew they'd be bringing it back. So we were lied to at every step of the way. I should have known they are a scam when I showed up to my entrance interview with a shitty make shift portfolio and they were shocked and amazed at how \"advanced\" I was. Or when I saw that there were classes with deaf people and interpreters...because that's super safe, having someone in the kitchen that can't communicate hot/sharp/other hazards. Half way through my year there, they finally started admission testing before you were accepted. They didn't do that for my group. We had so many people who couldn't even write a basic sentence or use a computer. I regret ever going there. Now I'm 21k in debt.

After instruction, Euathlus decided to not enter the profession of law, and Protagoras decided to sue Euathlus for the amount owed.\n\nProtagoras argued that if he won the case he would be paid his money. If Euathlus won the case, Protagoras would still be paid according to the original contract, because Euathlus would have won his first case.\n\nEuathlus, however, claimed that if he won, then by the court's decision he would not have to pay Protagoras. If, on the other hand, Protagoras won, then Euathlus would still not have won a case and would therefore not be obliged to pay.\n\nThe question is: which of the two men is in the right?\n\nThe story is related by the Latin author Aulus Gellius in Attic Nights.[1]\"\n\n\n", "id": "d186z1e"}, {"comment": "It doesn't matter who's right because that student was clearly a legal genius on a Saul Goodman level of assholery", "id": "d18p5k8"}, {"comment": "Savage.", "id": "d17humb"}, {"comment": "Article says she graduated with honors and passed bar on first attempt.

There are problems with either way. To charge the refinery allows importing fuel which then counts against the destination country. If the origin country doesn't do anything, then refiners can simply put refineries in tax havens. Also, it seems the cars are accessed for efficiency rather than miles - drive your car more, and you effectively pay less.

That's still fucking retarded.\n\nHaving read the paper, it's actually just a bullshit meta analysis  of people who have written about glaciers and is trying to depict the usual patriarchy nonsense in science.\n\n>It asks how glaciers came to be meaningful and significant (through what ontological and epistemological process), as well as trying to destabilize underlying assumptions about ice and environment through the dismantling of a host of boundaries and binaries. The feminist lens is crucial given the historical marginalization of women, the importance of gender in glacier-related knowledges, and the ways in which systems of colonialism, imperialism, and patriarchy co-constituted gendered science. Additionally, the feminist perspective seeks to uncover and embrace marginalized knowledges and alternative narratives, which are increasingly needed for effective global environmental change research, including glaciology (Castree et al., 2014; Hulme, 2011). A combination of feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political ecology provide the intellectual foundation for feminist glaciology.\n\nIs taken directly from the study and is a classic example of post-modernistic bullshit that exists in the feminist camp.\n\nIt's main assumption is simply patriarchy exists in glacial science and then goes on to talk about crap like \"manly masculanised glacial scientists\". As if working in a frozen environment where you can DIE if you don't have the right equipment is somehow conducive to someone who has very little body fat or ability to grow a beard etc. I mean really... if you're gonna accuse people who are naturally equipped to handle extreme environments, a waif female researcher with no head for heights is not going to be one of them. I think that might explain the \"patriarchy\".\n\nThere is no way this study had any money thrown at it though. This was just Carey writing a set piece for his own personal conscience because for some reason he believes this crap.\n\nBut then that's like saying a religious guy can't be an evolutionary scientist.

As per Clinton's memoirs (yes, this claim comes straight from CLINTON HERSELF, so is based on her *honesty*).... she was requested by a judge to defend a man accused of rape. After declining, the judge ordered her to do so. Due to scientific forensic testimony by an expert, the evidence in the case was called into question, and the prosecutors agreed to a plea deal. The defendant pleaded guilty to \"unlawful fondling of a minor\", and was sentenced to a year in prison and 4 years of probation. Many years after these events, while being interviewed regarding her book, Clinton laughed about the accuracy of polygraph tests and how a prosecutor illegally withheld evidence from her defense.\n\nSo well done, /u/SerJohrypants. I count at least five different false statements in that single sentence! Indeed, the only thing that doesn't seem to be wrong is that the girl was little.

Hillary has discussed flaws in the criminal justice system, while addressing potential fixes. So, Clinton is certainly the superior candidate, in that she has addressed these problems.\n\n>The girl is now a drug addict, probably from the trauma she experienced,\n\nIt's sad that attention placed on women by such trials and the media coverage often end up victimizing women even more than the crime itself! So, Clinton is certainly the superior candidate, in that she has addressed mental health care and assistance for drug addicts.\n\n>and I'm sure Hillary said some pretty disgusting dehumanising things to her that I cannot remember, \n\nSee above. Clinton is the only one offering help for people like yourself who have hallucinations or delusions of having witnessed or even perpetrated events that you actually only read about on the internet.\n\n> It doesn't matter if she asked to be removed. Its extremely bad taste. \n\nIt's true that in the U.S., rape victims can request to not testify in a trial, and then be charged with a crime if they refuse. There's no indication that this girl actually stated requested not to testify, and she obviously never testified in an actual trial, what with no trial even taking place. Despite that, Clinton is the superior candidate, since she is the only one addressing reform to the criminal justice system, as well as women's rights in general.\n\n> If you were raped by a priest and you heard the person who was defending him, laughing about details of your case years later, and this person was going to be president, how would you feel?\n\nI assume you are referring to personal experience. You have my condolences not only for having been raped by your priest, but also for past presidents not having helped you (though that may be due to you not living in the U.S. - just a thought). We really need better options for president, but Clinton - being the one that addresses these issues - is still the superior choice between the available options.\n\nJust FYI, I personally think a laughing rapist priest would make a worse president than Trump. I would feel bad is a laughing rapist priest ran for president... But probably even more so, if I was had been raped by that priest/presidential candidate.\n\n> It doesnt matter of she says she asked to be removed, we can't verify that, and it's coming from the mouth of someone who got away with having a top secret database in her basement she leaked filed from and didnt even get punished. \n\nAs per above, it's true we can't verify much of the things you are saying, including whether the girl asked to be removed from the trial. But blaming the victim, even with outlandish, potentially hysterical and delusional accusations like leaking a \"top secret database\" is never the answer. Despite being pure speculation on your part, women are often blamed for being the ones raped, and it's just not right. Clearly, Clinton is the superior candidate, due to her strong positions on women's rights, to empower women.\n\n>Its crazy.\n\nSee above.

Well hold the phone, why's that? Funny thing, my quran actually had the notes in the side.

His context was something like \"If it's a man and a women, they might get married, then corroborate against the deceased.\".

I have to look it up give me a minute.\n\nAlright, here it is\n\n> If you fear highhandedness from your wives, remind them [of the teaching of God], then ignore them when you go to bed, then hit them. If they obey you, you have no right to act against them. God is most high and great.\n\nFucking what? And the dude in the peanut gallery tried to defend it.

If they obey you, you have no right to act against them. God is most high and great.\n\nFucking what? And the dude in the peanut gallery tried to defend it.

And you will fast, mother fucker. You will fast and pray and believe and be generous and make it to mecca at least once in your life. Or else you're fucked. God damn you're so fucked. You eat that piece of pork? You have a drink? Damn I wouldn't want to be you. You'd better fucking hope and pray and shake in your god damn boots because the fires of hell and damnation are coming for you and they're coming right now and you're so fucking fucked, you'd better get your head on straight maggot and you'd better shape up and you'd better get down and pray at these times in these places in this direction every god damn day for the rest of your life *or else*.\n\nIt's a big fucking difference. And unlike the bible, there's no wiggle room. The bible is a collection of stories, and the few rules that are in there are old covenant shit. The shit we *didn't* follow, so God struck us a deal. Believe, sprinkle water, feel bad. That's it. So now, anything else in the bible is \"You should probably\" or \"This is sort of like...\"\n\nThe quran lays down the fucking law.\n\nNot all holy books are the same, not all religions are the same, and the only people who actually believe they are the same are people who *haven't actually read the fucking books*.\n\nYou want to have an opinion? Read the books. Seriously, read the fucking books.", "id": "d6qke36"}, {"comment": "So to clarify, the bible is more logical because God sends out his rules and you guys keep failing to follow them, and then suddenly Jesus comes so you all ignore the previous rules (yet still keep them in the book) and that makes sense somehow? \n\nAlso, you understand that Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are called the abrahamic religion because they all believe in the same God right? The Jews stopped on early. The Christians went to Jesus and stopped. The Muslims went to Mohammed and stopped. The Muslims by definition believe in Jesus. \n\nAlso, the Bible is pretty crazy as well in the new testament. John makes it clear several times that only Christians can be good and that everybody else is wicked. Predestination is also stated by Peter which damns us all to a fate when we are born. Your book states that God is going to burn all of us (i.e. non-believes such as myself) up when he ends the world. Peter also orders for subjection of females to men. Homosexuality also gets condemned in the new testament and those who practise it as sinners. \n\nThat isn't to say that the Koran isn't crazy. I've read an arabic translation of it and there are definitely things I don't agree with. But those are ignored by almost everybody who believes in the faith, just like the inconvenient truth of your religions are also ignored. \n\nAlso, the old testament is part of the bible so we should include it. Which includes all the baggage that comes along with it. You can't just pick and choose. Also, your friends, the chosen of god, the Jews? They don't believe in the New Testament so you must abhor Judaism right? At least Muslims by definition accept the word of Jesus. ", "id": "d6r7wj5"}, {"comment": "I never said the bible was more logical. I gave you my opinions on the two books. I'm an atheist as well, not that that should matter. And yes, that's the actual story. God gave out a bunch of rules, we couldn't follow them, he sacrificed his son so we wouldn't have to. Doesn't matter if it's logical, it's religion, logic doesn't enter into it. That's the honest to goodness story. The reason the old testament is included is because it's the explanation of why Jesus came and died.\n\nI understand that both are Abrahamic religions. But when was the last time a Muslim quoted the new or old testament? Probably the last time a Christian Scientist quoted anything but Mary Baker Eddy.\n\nAnd this is all just opinions anyway, so there's no way for me to prove anything 100%... Alright the bible is anti gay. Fine. But the bible is anti-divorce. And anti jewelry. And anti lust. And anti porn. And anti coveting other people's shit. All those sins are serious bad things, but Jesus came, so while we should feel bad for doing them and try hard to avoid them, it's not eternal damnation. Christians covet and divorce and wear jewelry and think about fucking other women all the damn time. All those \"stone the gays\" verses in the old testament, that's all old testament shit. That agreement is no longer in effect. So the story goes.\n\nThe quran is anti-gay as well. \n\n> For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)\n\n> If a man who is not married is seized committing sodomy, he will be stoned to death.\n\n> Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Loot, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.\n\nAnd yeah, quote me some Leviticus, it sounds the same, but that's the old testament. The old agreement. If we go back to old testament laws, we're all fucked. There is no \"breaking of the agreement, all sins forgiven\" in the quran. Those are the real actual laws that you *will* follow *or else.*\n\nOh, and one last major thing. *Muslims are currently killing gays*. Did I forget to mention that? It's fucking happening right God damn now. So until the Jews or the Baptists or the Buddhists start bombing French restaurants or chopping the heads off homosexuals, lets just consider the Muslim religion to be a bit different.

That completely destroys any chance that Cosby will see the inside of a prison, because it's the only public admission he ever made to drugging women, and it's only valid within the borders of the state wherein he made it, and it just so happens that that is the state that agreed his statements could not be used in a criminal case.\n\nThe reason it took so long to come out is because the agreement was made while the prosecutors office was under the administration of a predecessor. The current DA wasn't aware there had been a formal agreement until his retired predecessor called him up and warned him. I'm sure he's scrabbling to find a way to nullify it, but I doubt it'll happen. More than likely they will just wait for the situation to... go away.

Only thing that prevents them from doing so is hope that they do proper business and that credit card companies have means of punishing such vendors which prevent a company who want a long lasting relationship from abusing it.

It's a technical difference of who initiates the transaction. You send money to them rather than them asking for the money. Merchants have no way of requesting money from the system, they can only request the money from you. So you pay only when you intend to pay.

This sort of shit is considered a big scoop, and combined with corporate media's mission to not be \"biased\" (which, except for a handful of people that know what that means, ends up often meaning 100% acritical, which is awful), things fall apart quickly. It inevitably gives, you know, maybe 1%-5% of Americans who harbor these views a disproportionately large percentage of screen time. This *normalizes* it. It takes away shock value every time CNN broadcasts it. And CNN probably thinks it's okay because by showing it people will be naturally disgusted. And obviously many are, at least at first. But the more this sort of stuff is broadcast, if you're racist but not *foaming at the mouth racist* you're going to hear them out, if you're not racist but not anti-racist you're going to tolerate it, and if you're anti-racist you're not going to watch CNN.

Combine small skin cuts and conductive water (pool chemicals) and 12V can sometimes get enough current through you to kill you.  Granted, you won't cook like a hot dog, but it's possible.  The key here is the conductive water.  12V has killed.  It's done that in pretty contrived circumstances - directly across a chest.  But the conductive water makes the circuit path to and from your body very unpredictable and can include any path at all.\n\nIn fact, if the supply has enough current capability there isn't really a lower limit other than 0 volts.\n\nAlso, some failures can cause more than 12V to appear on the LVDC conductors.  Attempts are made to limit this, but a power supply located in the wrong place can bridge line voltage to the LVDC rail.  If the LVDC happens to be isolated, there would be nothing to keep that voltage from being full line with respect to ground (or the water).\n\nTo me, the thing here is it's a pool.  Lots of conductive water.  Usually there would not be a need to be very paranoid about changing light bulbs in a dry place, but it's a pool.  Because of that I'd probably first try to find multiple places to disconnect the power first - breaker AND unplug (if possible).  And I'd try to schedule it when someone else was around.\n\nI'm an R&D engineer and I'm 62.  I have been messing with electricity since I was 5.  I deal with everything; 2.7 volt logic, 480 volt 3-phase, 30kv/500mA CRT to name a very few so it's kind of important for me to get this right so I can do things without fear but still survive them.\n\nYou didn't ask, but the way I do this is not by being a safety nazi, which it could easily look like from my comments.  What I do is I make sure I have 100.00000% control over things I am doing involving dangerous stuff (electricity is just one of them).  If I can't get that control, I make sure I KNOW what's there before I'll get near - not touch - get near it.\n\nSimple example.  Do I worry about getting killed by a 12V car battery?  Not at all.  But...I don't go out on a rainy wet day and open up my car hood and then lean shirtless over electrolyte-smeared battery terminals to reach something - which, by the way, is the formula for death by 12V battery.\n\nEdit:  Boy, did that ever get wordy.

So the two, who have already been released, have to go back to prison.\n\n\n----\n\nActually, the father and his son were charged with nine charges after their multiple fires ended up endangered several firefighters and they attempted to bribe one of the firefighters.  \n\n---\n\nThe first fire in 1999 burned federal property and were informed that it would be considered a fire trespass in the future.  \n\nIn 2001, the father and son killed several deer and then lit multiple fires on federal property in Harney County, Oregon.  The fire was only around eight to ten miles away from Frenchglen,\nOregon.\n\nIn 2005, the father denied the government access to their lands to combat fires on federal property.  The father then within a week set his own fire next to land owned by a neighbor and damage their land.\n\nIn 2006, the son and father were disappointed in how late a prescribed burn would be to them.  They failed to get the burn to occur sooner.  Lighting caused a small fire near  Lower Bridge Creek that was put out by firefighters.  After the father and son were done moving cattle through the already burned area, they set multiple fires on federal land just nearby that resulted in $1,000+ in damages.  \n\nThat same day in 2006, about ten hours later, they set more fires near Krumbo Butte while firefighters were nearby for fire suppression.  Again, these fires resulted in damages of over $1,000.\n\nThe following day in 2006, possibly just after midnight, they set another series of fires, this time at Bridge Creek Road.  This time the series of fires were behind and infront of a group of firefighters.  They ended up driving around the fire engine and the firefighters that were within the area.  They were confronted by firefighters on the southern portion of the road and told to stop as they might end up killing someone.  In response, the son told the firefighters \"that maybe you guys had just better clear out.\"  \n\nThey then set another fire nearby and were told to halt by the same firefighters.  The son attempted to convince the firefighters not to report them to law enforcement.  After being allowed to leave, the son started another fire just behind the firefighters and left the scene.  Then they started yet another fire on the east side of Bridge Creek road.  Yet again, this fire damaged the property of the same neighbor as the 2005 fire.\n\nThe following day as the Bridge Creek fires in 2006, the father and the son found and destroyed evidence that they were at Bridge Creek Road the previous day and then the father threatened a firefighter that if they wanted to be a part of the community, they would make the issue of the fires go away.  If the firefighter did not, then the father would use his position to claim that the firefighter had started the fires.\n\n---\n\n* Count 1 was for CONSPIRACY for the father and son \"knowingly and willfully combined, conspired and agreed to commit [multiple offenses] against the United States.\"\n\n* Count 2 was for the USE OF FIRE TO DAMAGE AND DESTROY PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES with regards to the 2001 Hardie-Hammond Arson where they attempted to light multiple fires with the help (and forceful cooperation) of others to hide the deer killings.\n\n* Count 3 was for the USE OF FIRE TO DAMAGE AND DESTROY PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES with regards to the 2006 Lower Bridge Creek Arson where they set fires to attempt to burn the land of vegetation.\n\n* Count 4 was for USING FIRE TO CAUSE MORE THAN $1,000 OF DAMAGE AND DEPREDATION AGAINST PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES with regards to the 2006 Lower Bridge Creek Arson as it caused damage of over $1,000 to the area.\n\n* Count 5 was for the USE OF FIRE TO DAMAGE AND DESTROY PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES.  This time it was for the 2006 Krumbo Butte Arson where they lit fires while firefighters were nearby involved in fire suppression by watching for fires caused by lighting.\n\n* Count 6 was for the USE OF FIRE TO CAUSE MORE THAN $1,000 OF DAMAGE AND DEPREDATION AGAINST PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES with regards to the 2006 Krumbo Butte Arson.\n\n* COUNT 7 was for the USE OF FIRE TO DAMAGE AND DESTROY PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES AND CREATING A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF INJURY TO ANY PERSON with regards to what was referred to as the 2006 Grandad Arson.  These are the fires around the Bridge Creek Road area.  For the full definition: \"along and near Bridge Creek Road in the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Area.\"  Additionally, this fire was considered severe enough to endanger the lives of at least four firefighters.\n \n* Count 8 was for the USE OF FIRE TO CAUSE MORE THAN $1,000 OF DAMAGE\nAND DEPREDATION AGAINST PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES with regards to the 2006 Grandad Arson.\n\n* Count 9 was for TAMPERING WITH A WITNESS at the Frenchglen Hotel.  As quoted by the son to one of the four firefighters that were endangered: \"*This could get ugly and could be a sticky situation. You know management cycles through here all the time. I know that you want to be part of this community. If you want to stay here, you will make this go away. If I go down, I'm taking you with me. * * * You lighted those fires, not me.*\" \n\n---\n\nAdditionally, the issue with the sentence was that the father and son made an appeal to the court that the law on a mandatory minimum sentence for arson was unconstitutional. They won in the lower courts and were sentence well below minimum standards.  (15 months combined out of what would have been 120 months.)\n\nThe prosecution then appealed the ruling of the lower courts to the circuit court while the lowered sentence was being served.  The prosecution won that case since arson is a serious enough crime that the minimum should be at least five years.  The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court.  The court declined to hear the case, basically upholding the circuit court.  \n\nThus, they were forced to be resentenced as their initial appeal failed in the end.  However, they had already served time from the lowered (and now illegal) sentence.  That did counted.  So, basically here is the formula for what the sentence is:\n\n    Recent sentence (Five Years) - Illegal reduced sentence (Father - 3 Months; Son - 1 year and 1 day) = What is left to serve (Father - 4 years, 9 months; Son - 4 years minus 1 day)\n\nSources: \n\n*[Father - 3 Months; Son - 1 year (Technically 1 year and a day.)](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/01/01/oregon-ranchers-may-return-to-prison-in-land-fight-with-feds.html) \n\n*[Same, but a state source](http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2014/02/harney_county_rancher_and_son.html)\n\n*[A different type of source about during the case](http://www.opb.org/news/article/hammond_witness_describes_setting_fire_in_2001/) \n\n*[A source about the resentencing process that references the witness in the prior source](http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/33587326-75/federal-judge-in-eugene-returns-ranchers-to-prison-in-arson-case.html.csp) \n\n*[UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v.

THC and CBDs also interact with each other. Get really baked on a high THC/no CBD strain and then take a few good hits of medical strain like Ringo. You'll find your high immediately changes (a high cbd strain can actually bring you back down if you're too stoned and start panicking).\n\nTHC and CBD are the obvious and most noticable chemicals that have different effects but there's also mounting evidence that terpenes also have a very real effect on your experience. The terpenes are what give your weed it's various smells. However you absolutely need to have a legal dispensary to have any hope of understanding how different terpene profiles impact you.\n\nOn top of all the, not only do you have a range of different chemicals that affect you differently, they all tend to interact with each other.

This federal regulation also required speedometers to have a special emphasis on the number 55 (the national speed limit at the time).\n> \n> Limiting speedometers to 85 mph, even though most cars could go much faster, was in response to America's energy crisis. It was an attempt to slow cars down, and in doing so, save gas.\n> \n> The speedometer limits certainly didn't govern the speed of the car, and the 85 mph max looked pretty silly on cars like the Pantera and the Porsche 928. Some car manufacturers got around the rule by ending the numbers at 85 but leaving lines beyond that to show higher speeds.\n> \n> In reality, the 85 MPH speedo mandate did little to change the driving habits of most Americans. While government officials hoped gasoline consumption would fall by 2.2%, actual savings averaged less than 1%.\n> \n> \n> National Maximum Speed Law\n> \n> Back in 1974, part of the government's Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act prohibited speed limits higher than 55 mph across America. This National Maximum Speed Law (NMSL) was in response to oil price spikes and supply disruptions during the 1973 oil crisis. With fewer people driving, government officials started noticing highway deaths dropping and mistakenly associated it with speed. However, there was no proof that the lower speed limit was actually a factor.\n> \n> The mandatory 55 mph law was set about to be a fuel-saving measure but was widely disregarded by motorists, with many states opposing the law. Congress repealed the National Maximum Speed Law in 1995, returning speed limit settings to individual state governments.\n> \n> The 85 mph speedometer mandate ended in 1981 after much debate and little proof it actually did anything to change driver behavior. President Ronald Reagan, who campaigned on a pledge to end excessive government regulation, helped repeal the law. There has never been any data showing that the 85 mph speedometer saved lives.\n> \n> Porsche was one of the first manufacturers to switch back, offering recalibration and retrofit dials for their cars produced during 1979-1982.\n> \n> Many cars kept 85 mph speedometers for several years until they were redesigned. A mid-80s Buick Riviera with full digital dash would flash \"85-85-85\" when exceeding that speed, despite having the extra \"1\" for the hundreds digit (necessary for kilometers).

Then about a month before college ends and everyone goes their separate ways me and this other girl basically start being friends with benefits(and sleeping over almost daily because there was only like a month and a half worth of classes left), only thing is we never had just straight up sex and I never came because I couldn't get hard enough basically(not gonna complain though, I enjoyed the cuddles and it forced me to learn how to use my hands and mouth). \n\nIt took about two weeks before she could even touch me because it was waaaaaaay too ticklish to be enjoyable, it was like my dick was going \"WHHOOOOOh boy, not normal! something's wrong dude! intruder intruder\", and it wasn't performance anxiety[(And I know what anxiety feels like, honest to god didn't feel any kind of pressure to from her or myself)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjQMJ8fvQe4), me and her basically spent every time together with the attitude of  \"hey if it gets up it gets up and if not no biggie just cuddles\". \n\nBut after that month and a half that's when it kinda hit me that I'm a 23 year old guy, no outstanding health issues, in pretty good shape(not an olympian but but I went for 6m runs every other day on top of other exercises), and I was having a problem that affects 50 year olds but I put it out of my mind, I had school n shit to take care of.  \n\nFast forward about a month and a half in summer, I and a girl start seeing each other, third time seeing each other SHE can't get me hard(I belive experience with other girl let me get past the \"ticklish\" stage faster since I had something to draw from). She(after about 2months of consistently sleeping with each other every other night if not more) finally gets me to cum but still no intercourse because I still wouldn't be hard enough to even put the condom on.\n\nHonestly at this point I was starting to question whether or not if I was gay, I mean hey if you're dick basically failed on you enough times when you try to have sex with women and you're a virgin you start thinking stuff too. Finally force me to admit the fact that I have some form of ED. \n\nLooked around the internet, tried some supplements, then found the whole yourbrainonporn thing, and in my head it just kinda clicked. I realized there wasn't a single time that I had jacked off where there wasn't some form of video porn involved, and I didn't remember the last time I had some form of morning wood. So for the most part I decided that i just wasn't gonna use porn anymore and decided on masterbating only when I was naturally hard instead of if I was bored or something. And honestly it's interesting, I'm slowly getting normal erections again(morning wood and NARBS) along with some other details I won't bother you with.\n\nBut yeah, for me, I don't really think there was a point that I was ever addicted in a classical sense, but there was definitely a point where it came back and bit me in the ass because I was conditioned to it.", "id": "daoalmu"}, {"comment": "I'm not a professional, so I could be totally wrong.\n\nWhat you have is like you said, you accidentally conditioned yourself.

An accidental conditioning like this should be able to be reversed a lot easier than porn addiction. Tell your girlfriend to work with you. Stop watching porn an masturbating (for now, once you've corrected it shouldn't matter unless you do develop an addiction).

On the other hand, some scholars point to a radically lower estimate of only 108,000 annual defensive uses based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (Cook et al., 1997). The variation in these numbers remains a controversy in the field. The estimate of 3 million defensive uses per year is based on an extrapolation from a small number of responses taken from more than 19 national surveys. The former estimate of 108,000 is difficult to interpret because respondents were not asked specifically about defensive gun use.\n\nFurther: \n\n> A different issue is whether defensive uses of guns, however numerous or rare they may be, are effective in preventing injury to the gun-wielding crime victim. Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was \u201cused\u201d by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies (Kleck, 1988; Kleck and DeLone, 1993; Southwick, 2000; Tark and Kleck, 2004).

", "id": "d9yr9bm"}, {"comment": "I'm happy they made the decision they did, but their logic to do it was shit.\n\nBasically they said the right to marry whoever you want falls under the 14th Amendment's \"equal protection under the laws\" segment. The fist problem, is that the politicians in the 1860s *certainly* did not intend to legalize gay marriage whit their words. So what they intended the law to mean is not what the modern court meant. Take an example; If I wrote a biography and said I bought a watch \"becasue it looked cool\", I clearly mean the word in the modern slang equivalent of \"fashionable\". If someone in 150 years reads the book, they might think I meant \"cool\" as in \"low temperature\". But to do so would completely miss what I meant to communicate about the watch. In the same way, to understand a law's meaning you have to look at what the original writer's intended it to mean. This is what the court did in the Obamacare ruling- they knew what the writers meant, so rightly ignored what he literal text of the law said in favor of the intent. Yet with gay marriage, the intent of the writers was ignored in favor of the literal text. Justice Roberts was one of the few who sided with 'intent\" on both of these cases, which to me makes his dissent the best read regarding the gay marriage ruling\n\nBut most importantly, the modern court pretty much had to say that wanting a gay wedding is the same as being black, or a woman. The 14th was meant to protect people from discrimination about who they are, ie segregation and gender discrimination are not allowed, as they discriminate against people based on who they are.\n\nHowever a progressive tax system is not against the 14th amendment becasue it applies to everyone, even though it winds up affecting some races and genders more than others. Drunk driving laws are also not discriminatory, even though they only affect those who would drive while intoxicated. Gun laws are not discriminatory, even though they only harm people who like guns. A law saying marriage is between a man and woman is not discriminatory, because it affect all people regardless of gender or race or economic status, equally, although like the other laws it only affect certain people. If the marriage laws were \"marriage is between a white man and a white woman\", then that would be discriminatory. If a tax law was \"Asian people must overall pay more of their income than whites do to taxes\", then it would be discriminatory. Yet because the tax system applies to everyone equally, it isn't discriminatory even though it affects some groups more than others.\n\nEven though as a libertarian I do want gay marriage legalized, the logic the court used is off. Read Robert's dissent for a better explanation \n\nEDIT: For the record I'm not a lawyer, so I recommend that you read the majority and dissenting(s) opinions on the case. Or at least look up a left and right wing summation of the 2, and decide for yourself from there.

As of 2009 the treatments were unsuccessful, and attracted criticism as both scientifically unsound and dangerous.[23] The United States Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have rejected malariotherapy and, along with health professionals and advocates for human rights, consider the practice \"atrocious\".[24][25] The Heimlich Institute, a subsidiary of Deaconess Associations of Cincinnati, conducted malariotherapy trials in Ethiopia, though the Ethiopian Ministry of Health was unaware of the activity. Reportedly the trials were supervised by Mekbib Wondewassen, an Ethiopian immigrant who works as a car rental agent in the San Francisco area.

They'd go report it to different people, then compare stories after the observation is reported to see if their reports match.\n\nMost episodes, they were so good at this that they didn't find anything. In a sense, it was a very unexciting show- watching noobs bump around in the dark and have nothing to show for it. Then, after some long stretch of nothing, orbs, or EVP that prove little-to-nothing in their eyes- they'd get something kinda big.\n\nI mean- maybe they faked that stuff for ratings.

That'd kind of be up your underwhelming/bullshit zone. Then, ~1/10 of those, they'd catch something *huuuge*. Something that shook your faith in the world a little. And when they did catch something really cool, they'd always try to recreate the effect, and sometimes they couldn't even get close. What crazy phenomena they'd catch might actually lead them to say \"the H-word\" (which the main guys used *very* sparingly). That was exciting.\n\nThe second kind of investigation they did would be at a residential or business location. Not gonna lie- investigations at businesses almost always sucked, especially if they ran long. Supposed \"hauntings\" at businesses are usually people with over-active imaginations blurred with bar-lore. \n\nPrivate residencies, though- people's homes- were usually more interesting.

They'd explain-away rattling pipes, weird noises, and other weird shit. \n\nFor example: One investigation dealt with a kid being woken and hurt in his sleep.

Honestly, he's a nice man and judging by all the correspondence, studies, interviews etc., that I read while processing, cataloging and promoting that collection he's been a nice man with good intentions for most of his career. He had a number of really good ideas in his early career. The Heimlich maneuver is the most famous but he also developed techniques to help stroke victims relearn how to swallow, the Heimlich lung valve, the Heimlich micro-trach, the Heimlich suction sponge and a few others. These developments were genuinely great. They gave him significant notoriety and as a result people became \"yes men\" around him. If he had had more people around him willing to say \"no\" or to question him in any way his malariotherapy projects would probably have gone differently or wouldn't have been undertaken at all. I don't claim to know the man that well as I've only met him a handful of times, but I can generally glean a lot about a person when I have unfettered access to their lifetime's work for a year. IMO, he's a good man who was trying to help people and lost the plot somewhere along the way.

Everybody loooooooves to hate the spandex.\n\nWe're just out to ride our bike, not get drenched in sweat (which in the summer is annoying, and in the fall/winter can be hypothermia-inducing) and not have out perineum area get chewed up from chafing. Ever gone for a ride in jeans, or running/basketball shorts in the summer? Noticed your crotch was feeling kinda raw after you were done, and that your clothing was pretty wet?\n\nNow consider that properly fitting shorts prevent chafing for dozens, if not a hundred, miles. Riding a bicycle long distance in clothing not designed for it, is like hiking for hours in poor fitting shoes - there's going to be sadness, tears, and blood. And you know what area is probably the worst place to have raw, bleeding skin? That's right, your crotch!\n\nYou think a snug jersey is us trying to be obnoxious? You've never finished a several hour long ride with jersey that has been loose and flapping in the wind, rubbing against your skin. Go ask a friend who runs marathons about \"nipple chafing.\" Do it in person so you can see the wince. Maybe you're a runner, and you know how much it sucks to run against a headwind. Well, consider that a regular, fit cyclist can be doing upward of 20mph. So maybe that snug clothing that doesn't catch a lot of wind doesn't seem so stupid after all, huh?\n\nDone up like billboards, you say? Some of us ride in clubs or teams that get some free or discounted things in exchange for having their logo on the kit. Or some of us have done a charity ride and raised boatloads of money for a cause, and the advertisements on the jersey were from companies that donated services or money to that charity. Some of us do in fact race (or just ride hundreds of miles a week), and even if *we* can afford it, some of our team members might *need* those discounts/gimmies in order to ride/train/race. Riders come from all economic backgrounds, but sure, go on thinking they're all rich doctors.\n\nSome of the people you see out on the road are in fact professional riders, shockingly. It seems to baffle Americans in particular that a professional cyclist might be on the road with them; where do you think they train? The moon? The pay for a pro cyclist is shit, so they actually *do* depend on the stuff their team receives for sponsorship, which it receives in exchange for putting stuff on the jersey.\n\nSome of us might be fans of particular teams, companies, riders, or a famous race series. My friend gets challenged for \"thinking he's Lance\" when he's out for a ride in a replica kit, but you put on a jersey, head do the local bar, drink beer, and scream things at a TV about a sport you've probably have little personal experience with - does anyone accuse you of thinking you're a professional hockey/baseball/football/soccer/cricket player? Go to a NASCAR race and everyone's wearing their favorite driver's number. How many of those people \"think they're a race car driver\"? How many of those people have driven a race?\n\nSome of us **may** be concerned about whether we look good, and find that there are plenty of people who find a fit, muscular person of their desired gender in tight clothing to be very attractive. We're dating or married to many of them, and many of them look rather fabulous themselves because they get a lot of exercise as well. And two people in great shape have pretty fantastically amazing sex. Go ask in /r/fitness if you don't believe me. And the endorphins make us pleasant people for our partners to be around.\n\nOr perhaps you mean the bright yellow, reflective clothing some of us wear? The clothing that we're told we have to wear because otherwise drivers might have a hard time 'seeing' us, because by and large society feels that we bear primary responsibility for our safety?\n\nSo, yeah. You're absolutely right. Most of us don't care about **how you think** we look. We're trying to get where we're going, comfortable, alive, uninjured - and if possible, enjoy the journey.\n\nEdit: maybe I sound \"defensive\" because this is the thousandth time I've read people (who know nothing about cycling yet feel qualified to comment on it) whinging/joking about cyclist clothing (or how we are \"self-entitled\", deserve to be hit/killed, all break the law, yadda yadda) and I'm tired of all the hatred and bigotry and asshole-y behavior I receive while riding on the road, and from being hit by people busy doing everything except driving their car. You know who has unresolved issues and is entitled? The asshole in the bro truck who feels it necessary to scream \"FAGGOT!\" out his window while slamming the accelerator to \"roll coal\" as he drives past a complete stranger who was doing absolutely nothing to him other than requiring him to slightly shift his steering wheel to one side and then back again.\n\nAlso: thank you, I am aware that you do not need to wear spandex to ride a bicycle.  I was explaining why cyclists DO wear spandex, not saying it's impossible to not do so. I usually put about 100 miles a week on a transportation bicycle, my primary way of getting around. I dress for what I'm going to, and the weather - but I do have to be careful about things like my underwear choices, or I'm going to regret it.

Naturally, it's frustrating for people in cars and don't lie and pretend like it isn't if you've seen this done. I always look out for cyclists and am respectful. But, I feel like, if you are one, you're not really doing yourself any favors by riding in the middle of the lane and dodging between them, which I've seen many, many cyclists do, too.

So if the cyclist feels that they are safer to take the whole lane then they can. There is no minimum speed. Just like grandma can ride 10 miles an hour in her caddy down the road so can a cyclist.

I bet death threats would drop pretty quick after that."], [32, "Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of cream pie, you don't get any. So you say \"I should get my fair share.\" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, \"everyone should get their fair share.\" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!\n\n\nThe problem is that the statement \"I should get my fair share\" had an implicit \"too\" at the end: \"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else.\" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant \"only I should get my fair share\", which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that \"everyone should get their fair share,\" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.\n\n\nThat's the situation of the \"clown lives matter\" movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society.\n\n\nThe problem is that, in practice, the world doesn't work the way. You see the film Nightclowner? You know the part where Bongo Bonzo tells Dazzle Jumbo that she doesn't want footage of a clown or jokester person dying, she wants news stories about affluent normal people being killed? That's not made up out of whole cloth -- there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are normal) can identify with. So when a young clown person gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered \"news\", while a middle-aged normal person being killed is treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate -- young clown people are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don't treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don't pay as much attention to certain people's deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we don't treat all lives as though they matter equally.\n\n\nJust like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase \"clown lives matter\" also has an implicit \"too\" at the end: it's saying that clown lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying \"all lives matter\" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means \"only clown lives matter,\" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying \"all lives matter\" as a direct response to \"clown lives matter\" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.\n\n\nTL;DR: The phrase \"Clown lives matter\" carries an implicit \"too\" at the end; it's saying that clown lives should also matter. Saying \"all lives matter\" is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to."], [31, "How many *actual*, *document* cases of bad guy clowns?"], [29, "As a Yuropean I don't get this clown thing at all.\n\nI mean, what's so scary about them?

So you say \"I should get my fair share.\" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, \"everyone should get their fair share.\" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!\n\n\nThe problem is that the statement \"I should get my fair share\" had an implicit \"too\" at the end: \"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else.\" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant \"only I should get my fair share\", which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that \"everyone should get their fair share,\" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.\n\n\nThat's the situation of the \"clown lives matter\" movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society.\n\n\nThe problem is that, in practice, the world doesn't work the way. You see the film Nightclowner? You know the part where Bongo Bonzo tells Dazzle Jumbo that she doesn't want footage of a clown or jokester person dying, she wants news stories about affluent normal people being killed? That's not made up out of whole cloth -- there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are normal) can identify with. So when a young clown person gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered \"news\", while a middle-aged normal person being killed is treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate -- young clown people are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don't treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don't pay as much attention to certain people's deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we don't treat all lives as though they matter equally.\n\n\nJust like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase \"clown lives matter\" also has an implicit \"too\" at the end: it's saying that clown lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying \"all lives matter\" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means \"only clown lives matter,\" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying \"all lives matter\" as a direct response to \"clown lives matter\" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.\n\n\nTL;DR: The phrase \"Clown lives matter\" carries an implicit \"too\" at the end; it's saying that clown lives should also matter. Saying \"all lives matter\" is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to.", "id": "d9bj1ys"}, {"comment": "That comment was a long walk in big red shoes", "id": "d9bkbo1"}], [{"comment": "How many *actual*, *document* cases of bad guy clowns?", "id": "d9bflz4"}], [{"comment": "As a Yuropean I don't get this clown thing at all.\n\nI mean, what's so scary about them?

However Oceania was not always at war with Eurasia, but the history books are re-written every time the war changes (A triangle of wars between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia). So when people are using it in terms of Trump, it's the blind following of his supporters, that he can say whatever he wants and the people believe him.\n\nIn the book, people were alive when Oceania and Eurasia allied (during what was WW2) however Big Brother assures them that for eternity Oceania and Eurasia were always at war. Due to constantly being told, and past evidence being destroyed, that this is the truth, even the people alive during different times start to doubt themselves and follow along. It sort of links to a quote I posted recently, saying \"Who controls the past controls the future, Who controls the present controls the past\" which is also from 1984. Saying whoever is in control now, can control how the past is perceived. This is what Trump is doing, despite Californian's downright knowing there was a drought, he just says there wasn't (and isn't), and those of him that support him just blindly agree.\n\nHope this clears it up.

If you are a large company, especially a very large national or multi-national company that has to enforce policies across the board and knows you will have to deal with potential employee issues and even maybe lawsuits if you treat employee A different from employee B, C or D, then you need a hard line in the sand and to enforce it the same every time.  \n\nAnd the biggest reason for this is because people are idiots who take advantage every time.  \n\nMy wife works for a giant insurance company as a customer service manager.  And previously was with one of the giant telecom companies.   I have also worked in the corporate world and hired/managed up to hundreds of people at a time in various professional capacities.  \n\nAs soon as you allow say, open toed shoes, or any type of yoga/stretch pants, or whatever clothing option COULD be work appropriate if done property, but could also be very inappropriate if done the wrong way, you have a can of worms that is not worth your time and effort to police.  People simply cannot behave like adults and be trusted to make responsible decisions when you are dealing with that many of them.  \n\nAnd as soon as one person gets away with shoes,clothes,language, etc.. that is even slightly inappropriate, someone else uses it as an excuse to do something far more inappropriate because it is \"the same thing\".  \n\nSo the only \"fair\" and more importantly, efficient and legal way to deal with it is to have a rigid and obvious policy.  \"No open toed shoes\" for example so people don't show up in flip flops.    No shoulders exposed, so people don't wear inappropriate tank tops or \"club wear\" type stuff.  And so on.  \n\nThese types of policies aren't there so that the stuff that IS appropriate but technically violates the guidelines can't be worn.  But so that the people who would use that stuff to push the envelope and wear stuff that is inappropriate can't use it as an excuse.  \n\nIn today's world, there has to be a hard line.  You can't say, even though it's obvious, \"yes, Jen get's to wear open toed shoes and show her shoulders because she is wearing nice pumps and a professional blouse and looks like a business person and you are wearing 10 year old Crocs and a Juicy shirt two sizes too small and look like something out of a Worldstar video.\"\n\nYou have to take all subjectivity out of it.  And since you can't trust adults to act like adults and be professional.  It has to be cut and dry language.  And in order to enforce it for the clear (and usually deliberate) violators, you have to enforce it for the slight (and often accidental) violators.

I **did** get told that if I worked hard and did well I would 'earn' myself a professional job, though.\n\nThis is one thing baby boomers really don't seem to understand. When they were teenagers, getting a first class degree really was a ticket to something. I graduated top of my school at university, worked part time from the age of 14 for \"job experience\", and when I went into the workforce was told I could expect no more than minimum wage and the exact same job as I could have got if I had left school at 16 and not spent an enormous amount of money going to university.\n\nMy parents and their ilk were confused about that. And I was **bitter** - enormously bitter, for a while. I really thought what the fuck was the point in trying so hard? \n\nNow fair enough, I did a course according to my interests. I wanted to work in the media so I did a humanities based course, which seemed to make sense to me. And it's more difficult to get a job with a humanities degree because it doesn't lend itself to anything in particular. And to get into the media you need to do \"free work experience\" for a while (with *whose* money?!) \n\nHonestly, if you don't want millenials to be bitter, just tell them more realistic things when they're growing up. Give up on the \"if you work really hard at school you can earn your way in life\" narrative. Raise children to expect to start at the bottom and work their way up regardless of what education they achieve. If you raise people with realistic expectations, then they won't be bitter when they meet the real world.\n\nAnd if anyone here wants to go into the media. Start young and get your \"unpaid work experience\" outside of school hours instead of having a job that pays. That's what gives you the leg up. I feel ridiculous about it now, but I didn't even think to do that. No one else was doing it around me and no one mentioned it.

In the [8 states](http://www.farmtoconsumer.org/raw-milk-nation-interactive-map/) where the *sale* of milk is completely illegal... You can still buy a cow. I'm betting, if you put your mind to it - preferably with the legal advice of an attorney - you could still find some way to pay for it - you'd just have to disguise it as something else, like a \"ranch club membership\" (but not a \"herd share agreement\", unless you live in Colorado or North Dakota). Just don't explicitly make it about buying milk; rather the milk is provided for free to members. Again, check with an attorney.\n\n>The article mentions raw oysters, we also have other common risky foods such as raw fish, puffer fish, and many more.\n\nFirst, raw oysters are regulated in some states. Second, there is absolutely no mistaking a raw oyster for a cooked oyster. The only realistic way to tell the difference between pasteurized and raw milk, aside from labeling the liquid, would be to taste it. Third, the number of people who eat oysters is vastly smaller than those who drink milk, and far fewer children. Finally, the total number of people to die from raw shellfish can, in a typical year, be counted using your fingers.\n\n>I think some unrealistic fear that these products won't be labeled sufficiently is a poor reason to limit people's liberties.\n\nLabels aren't new. They've been around since people could carve symbols into the side of a clay pot. Yet, the laws are comparatively new (granted, \"new\" being nearly a hundred years). They were passed for a reason, and it's not because everyone felt they should have the right to drink raw milk. It's because so many people, especially children, died from food poisoning.\n\n*After* many jurisdictions regulating it... \"In 1938, milkborne outbreaks constituted approximately 25 percent of all disease outbreaks from contaminated food or water. As of 2002, that figure was down to about 1 percent.\"\n\nhttp://www.marlerclark.com/pdfs/raw-milk-jeh.pdf\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me that conservative/Libertarians seem to think these laws were handed down from ancient Greece and no one was ever bright enough to reconsider them since ice factories were invented. If you think the laws were a bad idea to begin with, fair enough, but they are just as valid and necessary as in the 1920's.

And as others have said in these comments, it has ties back to racism against blacks as big/dumb/fast athletes compared to their \"hard working\" and \"smart\" white counter parts. \n\nThe NFL has, to some degree, begun to deal with the traditional bias against black quarterbacks (but you still often hear black QBs described in relation to their athleticism, rather than mental skills related to the position). However, there is still a heavy bias against white players that choose to be running backs or corner backs stemming from some very old, racist beliefs about the inherent value of blacks as \"more athletic\" but not up to snuff in the \"mental\" side of the game. And really, that belief isn't so much the NFL as it is football in general. Young athletic white kids are generally steered away from RB/CB early in their careers, so very few of NFL caliber even get a chance to enter the NFL at those positions at all. \n\nHonestly, McCaffrey is lucky that he's a scholarship white RB for a quality D1 school. Honestly if he didn't have a father that played more than a decade in the NFL, he probably wouldn't have gotten that chance. \n\nCase in point is current NFL RB Danny Woodhead. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK6yvJuLIyU) his official Chargers-produced highlight clip from 2015. Here's the only quote it contains related to Woodhead's ability: \"There you go Danny! Ooh look that move. I love that little guy man. **He just works so hard bro.**\" \n\nFor those that don't know, Danny Woodhead is an incredible athlete. He grew up in Nebraska and finished his high school career as the all-time leading rusher in the history of Nebraska's top division (4,891 yards). He also ran a 10.5 100 meter dash in track and field, scored 47 points in a basketball game, and 16 goals in a season in soccer. The one and only scholarship offer he received was to Division II Chadron State in Chadron, NE (population 5,800). The University of Nebraska encouraged him to walk-on and pay his own way as a specialist kick returner. \n\nAt Chadron, Woodhead rushed for 7,962 yards (then an NCAA record) including a Jr year in which he gained 2,756 yards in 13 games, scoring 34 touchdowns. He won the Harlon Hill Trophy (Div II's version of the Heisman) twice. That was not enough to garner Woodhead an invite to the 2008 NFL combine, however. At his Pro-day with Chadron State, NFL scouts timed him at 4.33 in the 40 yard dash, 38.5\" vertical, 4.03 pro-agility, 11.2 60-yard shuttle with 20 reps on the bench press. Numbers equivalent or better than Darren McFadden, the #4 overall pick in the 2008 draft, yet Danny went undrafted through 7 rounds. \n\nDanny has never gotten a shot to be \"the man\" in the NFL, but he's stuck around and produced very well when called upon by the Patriots and Chargers. One has to wonder how things might have been different for Danny if there wasn't a bias against white running backs in football as a result of those backward beliefs about race and athleticism by rich white guys running NFL teams decades ago. \n", "id": "d3d9jsd"}, {"comment": "Woodhead is also like 5'7\", which a lot of people thought would make him not effective in the NFL.

If Woodhead had a couple plays like that in the NFL he'd be as valued as Sproles. Woodhead may be similar and even equally as fast, but speed alone isn't the only thing. Things that are harder to measure in numbers like making guys miss and changing the directions and angles of that speed on a dime also come into play. ", "id": "d3dg2mn"}, {"comment": "That's kind of my entire point, though. By measurable metrics, Woodhead is faster and more agile than Sproles, yet you're labeling Sproles as \"explosively fast\" and different from Woodhead when they play the exact same role in the NFL.

Because you're describing his game almost exactly and then implying he can't do those things.

Since no one runs 40 yard dashes in actual games his top speed doesn't matter as much as things like making guys miss and I would argue sproles is smarter about his running.

This problem of separating the past with the present as two distinct elements is used in many ways by young earth creationist's. Most obvious is Ken Ham, who argues that sciences that attempt to understand the past can't because that is \"historical science,\" compared to the present's observational science.

Their understanding becomes almost like a child who sees a horror movie and now thinks there are monsters in the dark, or watches a fantasy kung fu film and thinks he can soar or float through the air- these things feel plausible or possible if you ignore the reality of our actual lives.

If a 4-star driver gets fired, what happens to the consistent 1-star drivers I seem to get every morning? In the span of a week, I had a driver twice. Each time, he didn't want to listen to what I said was the better route to my work (\"It's only 2 and a half miles, please don't take the freeway\" *driver gets on freeway, stuck in traffic for 15 minutes making me late*) and almost got into an accident. I gave him 1-star each time, and his overall rating wasn't even affected.\n", "id": "d62lodf"}, {"comment": "I have several friends who work for Uber, both as drivers and in the corporate office. \n\nWhen a driver gets a very low rating, that doesn't reflect their average rating (i.e. They almost always get 5 stars, and then get one 1 star), they can contest it. Uber doesn't do much work to fact-check these, because they're very hands-off with reaching out to end customers. So, the driver gets a 1 star, shoots off an email saying \"the customer was mad because there was traffic at 7am\" and uber wipes the 1 star from their record. \n\nUber's app has its own navigation, and determines the route the driver takes. If the driver varies from this route (i.e. Takes surface streets instead of the freeway) it can have a more negative effect on the driver. Uber's navigation doesn't factor for traffic. So let's say the driver did take surface streets, but you still rated him low (you, specifically, might have not -- but some people still might). He pushes it up to corporate, who check the logs -- the route he was \"supposed\" to take, versus the route he did take -- and then come back, saying \"well, obviously the customer was unhappy, you took a longer route which charged more.\" And the 1 star rating would stay. \n\nSo, really, the 5-star rating system fucks people over twice:\n\n1. When drivers receive anything less than 5 stars, they risk being fired, which ruins the integrity of a linear scale. \n\n2. Drivers are encouraged to drive \"by the book\", along a route pre-set by uber. Deviating from that route to avoid traffic will, in-turn, increase the chance of less-than-5-star ratings sticking to their accounts, meaning they are more likely to purposefully drive into freeway gridlock, knowing they can have an easier time removing a low review (which, in turn, fucks the customer).

So I tune to talk radio because having it on low is better than those two songs or silence. Here are some of the craziest things I've heard on his show. \n\n- He was born in Dubai, so he, naturally, is an expert on all things Middle East and Muslim (spoiler alert: his real name isn't Erik, Eric or Erick Erickson; its Matthew or Mark or something). \n\n- He is currently in seminary school and truly, honestly believes this makes him smarter than everyone else. About everything. He has said so. \n\n- He championed a state bill last year that would allow microbreweries to freely sell their beer in any quantity to those touring the brewery, something still illegal in Georgia because reasons. During the EXACT SAME SHOW, he rallied against the legalization of cannabis oil for use in treating juvenile seizure disorders because it would open the door to legal recreational marijuana use. Seriously. \n\n- I don't remember the exact situation he was referring to, but he has, more than once, said homosexuality and being transgendered are severe mental disorders that could easily be cured by proper Christian faith. \n\n- My favorite, though, seems to happen on a weekly basis: Every single time a tragedy happens - terrorism, natural disaster, you name it - he does the expected and blames liberals. What makes it so delightful is that he takes it a step further and openly wishes for the end of days and a war to dissolve the entire USA. it's never clear whether he expects Jesus or well-armed rednecks to usher in the apocalypse, but he is clearly wishing and waiting for it with baited breath.   \n\n- Oh yeah, did I mention he thinks he is a world class chef? A friend went to one of his cooking demonstrations and said his gumbo tasted like it was flavored with old man toenails, tennis ball can air and sweat-flavored licorice. I guess Jesus saves, but doesn't cook much. \n\nIf you've never heard his show, give it a listen once or twice. He out-crazies Rush and Sean Hannity by a mile.

(Also More \"bling\" and better \"things\" to impress people)\n\n Either way it destroys everyone over time. I got out once I saw what it was doing to my friends. \n\n We all started doing it for everyone around us. So we could actually hang out and buy food when one us, friends, or family members were hungry. Sometimes we were just happy if we could sell enough so we all could go to the movies. Eventually By the time I turned 21 I saw one friend after an other get caught up in the game. Most of them didn't even realize what they were becoming from being in it for so long.\n\n Me personally? I wasn't as affected because I gave all drug money earned to my family. I would literally come home and give my grandpa 2,000$ hard cash for rent, food, and money for my mother and nephew. \n\n I guess getting 2,000$ for a days worth of work is too much temptation for most people. That easy money goes to people's heads and they want more and more. \n\n Anyways I wish society didn't condemn a lot of my friends back then. Most of them never harmed anyone, but just couldn't resist the allure of having even a middle class amount of money for the first time in their lives. The ironic thing is we all started because we couldn't get jobs that would pay enough to help our families and friends. \n\n Now they have criminal records and can't get a real job to support their families or themselves, anyway. :(\n\n Last time I visited my friend said, \"It's hard to even call myself a Man when I can't even make enough for my ma and pa to eat.  I have no way of repaying society everything I did wrong because people just see me as a criminal and nothing else. I just want to become a good man from the bad kid but will anyone else see it?\"", "id": "d557xla"}, {"comment": "Knew of a similar set up in the mid 90's, except the ending was prison for the crew.

If millions of people can do a given type of job, the wage is going to be low.\n  \nYou also have to define your terms. What do you consider a \"living wage\"? Is it enough money to afford a place to live on your own, perhaps with car payments and other expenses with enough money to eat out and party on the weekends? Depending on what you want your \"living wage\" to cover and where you live, $15 an hour might not come close to being enough. Improve your skills, improve your value to employers, and your salary will increase. That will happen because you'll qualify for better jobs and employers will be willing to pay more to keep you.", "id": "d54cjg0"}, {"comment": "Saying minimum wage jobs aren't mean to be a career means you don't live in reality anymore. The reality is that that is what is available. Majority of minimum wage jobs are being held by adults working 40 to 60 hours a week to afford to keep a roof over their heads. I think the definition of a living wage is you are paid 3 times, monthly, the average amount of rent/housing in your area, if I'm not mistaken. Because rent should only be 1/3 of your income. There are not jobs to increase to, there is nowhere to move up nowadays. We need to take care of the people living in this country and insure that employers take care of them as well.

You can read their report here: \n  \nhttp://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/archive/characteristics-of-minimum-wage-workers-2014.pdf\n  \n\"In 2014, 77.2 million workers age 16 and older in the\nUnited States were paid at hourly rates, representing 58.7\npercent of all wage and salary workers. Among those\npaid by the hour, 1.3 million earned exactly the prevailing\nfederal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. About 1.7 million\nhad wages below the federal minimum. Together, these\n3.0 million workers with wages at or below the federal\nminimum made up 3.9 percent of all hourly paid workers.\n  \nThe percentage of hourly paid workers earning the\nprevailing federal minimum wage or less declined from 4.3\npercent in 2013 to 3.9 percent in 2014. This remains well below the figure of 13.4 percent in 1979, when data were\nfirst collected on a regular basis. (See table 10.)\"\n  \n\"I think the definition of a living wage is you are paid 3 times, monthly, the average amount of rent/housing in your area, if I'm not mistaken.\"\n  \nSo, if the average rent in your area is $1000 a month (high for some places, very low for others), you think the wage should be $3000 a month. Given the costs of employing someone that I listed above, you'd need to produce $6000 or more per month to even justify your job's existence. If a person works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year, that's 2080 hours. $3000 a month (unrealistic) is $36,000 a year. Divide $36,000 a year by 2080 hours and you get $17.31 an hour. That doesn't even cover any of the other expenses of employing you. In reality, you'd need to produce over $30 an hour of value to your employer to justify your job's existence. If you can't do that, you don't deserve the salary. Your job's salary isn't based on what you need, it's based on the value you produce. It's amazing how many people can't grasp that simple economic fact. Artificially raising the cost of labor forces employers to buy less of it.
