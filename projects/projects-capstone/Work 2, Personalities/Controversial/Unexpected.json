He burst out the other side and ran past me. \n\n(My grandfather always stares off into the distance like he does when he talks about my late grandmother at this point in the story) I wish I would've followed him.

It was one of those summers I'll always remember (because he didn't have any stupid ass reading assignment because it was the fucking 4th century and school was reserved for nobility) spending my days at the lake and my nights catching fireflies in the field with my friends.\n\nI was fishing one day by the creek (to eat for dinner hell if I know. I don't know what to do when you actually catch one) all on my own just to spend some time and watch the clouds. Out of the forest I saw a great flock of birds disperse into the heavens (fucking old people and they're words) and out of the trees burst the skateboard man. He focused intently with his 100 yard stare, visualizing his sick trick. I watched him, but he didn't notice or didn't care that I was there.\n\nHe ran straight at the creek without blinking. I expected him to at least jump it but he didn't. His steps were steadfast as he plunged into the cool clear waters. He burst out the other side and ran past me. \n\n(My grandfather always stares off into the distance like he does when he talks about my late grandmother at this point in the story) I wish I would've followed him. I wish I would've seen the places he's seen. I wish I could end up seeing whatever sick trick he had planned in such a focus. If I could do it all again I'd give it all up to see what it would've been had I followed that guy. (He looks straight at me out of 5 granchildren) Especially you. I could live without seeing that.

Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.\n\n>The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I\u2019m not sure she even showers, much less shaves her \u201cwomanly\u201d parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.\n\n>But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I\u2019m sure after work. He probably hasn\u2019t been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he\u2019s only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960\u2019s, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it\u2019s trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.\nAnyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.", "id": "d4r8vr9"}, {"comment": "I've seen this one so many times I know it by the first sentence.", "id": "d4r9z8y"}], [{"comment": "Spongebob is 22?\n", "id": "d4r3hol"}, {"comment": "On July 14th he will be 30 according to the SpongeBob wiki.", "id": "d4r5xdg"}, {"comment": "Can't wait for those midlife crisis episodes.", "id": "d4rby3l"}, {"comment": "In the one episode where he gets his drivers license temporarily, it shows his birth date.

It seems like he has a good understanding of how to make one. What I'm referring to is his metal casting technique and his safety gear. \n\n1. He should be wearing full gauntlet gloves, not flimsy, half cloth/half leather gardening gloves. Gauntlets will go up your forearm and have saved my ass many times from splatter.\n\n2. He should be wearing a flame retardant jacket or leather jacket. Split cowhide. Nothing less. Molten metal of any kind will burn through cotton like it doesn't exist.  Aluminum is one of the lower temperature casting metals as well(other than pewter and the like).\n\n3. His footwear is just plain stupid. Tennis shoes will do nothing if you step on a piece of casted metal. Full leather boots with a steel toe. I've hear horror stories of a someone who didn't use full, up the ankle boots and used more low top shoes. A drip of metal went down their leg and burned the inside of their foot and held it there. They had to have surgery/skin grafting.\n\n4. Using his \"ripped jeans\" is a really dumb idea for leg wear. He should be at least wearing leather chaps that will help with leg/foot protection. Again, splatter. \n\n5. He should be wearing a face shield along with his safety glasses(if he has any on). There are some kind that include a hard hat in case of falling sparks or even if there is rapid expansion as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A796N_YZTm8 This is a prime example of what happens when you don't know what you are doing. If you are making ingots, regardless of how dry and hot it is outside, there is going to be a THIN layer of moisture that sits in the mold. You need to heat up the ingot in order to remove that layer BEFORE pouring into the mold. What happens if you are this guy and forget? All that wonderful tshirt/ripped jeans/canvas shoes/facemask-less eyewear isn't going to save you from from getting severally burned.  \n\n6. Using \"salad tongs\" like hes using is getting your hands WAY too close to the metal. Yes, they are cheap, but cheap also means = not made well. What happens if that gets way too hot for him to handle even with gloves on? Hes holding a full crucible of metal and drops it? Those awesome canvas shoes won't do shit to protect him. \n\n7.  Using Aluminium cans is dumb to cast with. Do you see how much slag(garbage material) he has to pull out of the crucible to finally get cast-able aluminum? It takes a LOT and all the while, all of that paint/garbage is getting  into the atmosphere around him, breathing it in. Unless hes got a vapor filtering mask on, I bet hes getting a lot of that shit in his lungs. Also his special \"surprise\" at the end with the sword...that was made from foam. Probably high density pink foam you can get from home depot. See all that black shit when he pours it? Yeah, hes probably breathing all of that burning foam, which is really toxic. Yes, I do know that hes outside, but it doesn't matter when hes using salad tongs which brings him withing inches of the casting.\n\nI know I sound like a fucking fuddy duddy, but I've got a lot of casting experience.

You can already mitigate risk by:\n\n- heating up your mold beforehand to avoid the explosive water vapor problem\n\n- knowing in advance, if your tongs get really hot, that it's better to burn your fingers a bit while setting the metal down gently than to just drop it and risk splatter all over your body\n\n- consider ventilation/wind direction/something to minimize exposure to burning soda can paint\n\n- don't make your mold out of something that's toxic when it burns\n\n- because you know now that your tshirt and sneakers will do nothing to protect you, if there is splatter you will gtfo immediately, zero hesitation\n\nYou can also now make educated decisions about what minimum gear to buy. It sounds like your best purchases would probably be:\n\n- longer tongs (partially mitigates risk of splatter, fumes, and hand burning\n\n- full face mask\n\n- leather boots\n\nand who knows? maybe a flame retardant apron isn't super expensive.", "id": "czcks8z"}, {"comment": "I really hope I didn't push you away from trying something new.

I visited a artists and his wife who worked in bronze. Bronze melts at around 1700 degrees....so around 300-500 degrees hotter than aluminum. They had a long day of casting and got complacent because they just wanted to get it done. They forgot to preheat the ingot and rapid expansion happened. They both were wearing full gear, but with mesh face-shields, which reduce heat towards the face, but not fully protecting. The expansion happened and the molten bronze fired at his face, hit the mesh, then hit his safety glasses. He showed me his safety glasses which have now a nice bronze inlay that he keeps as a reminder to 1. stop using mesh face shields 2. always wear eye protection.
