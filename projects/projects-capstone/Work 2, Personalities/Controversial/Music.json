Davis explained the album title: \"The title The Path of Totality refers to the fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time. That's how this album came together. I think all the producers feel the same way. I'm not sure it could ever happen again.\"\n\n> Korn currently has over 36 singles, over 25 of which have charted.

I'm *so* excited that you're doing an AMA! I've loved your band pretty much since 2005. \n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1. *This is Gospel* is my favorite song from you, as I am sure it is for many because everyone can relate to the song in so many ways. Others say it talks about suicide (I think about a struggling relationship and learning to let go.) It's truly amazing when you can write a song and it can touch so many people who are struggling through so many different problems. \"And truth be told, I never was yours.\" always gets me. It's such a flexible and powerful song that it never fails to inspire a massive range of emotions and thoughts. **Is there a song that has had such a meaningful impact on you that it became unique and personal, like the musician had written it just for you?**\n\n2. It's been interesting and awesome to see you evolve as a musician, but still keep your original and unique style. Every album seems to have a different theme to it, but each never fails to send some sort of message. **Overall, what message do you think this album has sent to the world?**\n\n3. **As a book lover, what is your favorite book? Also, are you a fan of poetry, and has it ever inspired any part of your music?**\n\n\nAnd I have to just say this:\n\nI can still remember when *I Write Sins Not Tragedies* came on the radio, and I became a fan immediately. When *Pretty. Odd.* came out, I would sit outside in the summer evenings and listen to it while I watched the sunsets fade and the stars come out. It's one of my fondest memories. I'm going to the beach this spring, and I plan to do the same thing. In addition, I just have to say *End of All Things* is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. I have absolutely fallen in love with the *Death of a Bachelor* album--it has such a jazzy elegance to it! I love the Sinatra feel. My favorite song(s?) is a tie between *House of Memories* and *Impossible Year*. Yet, anytime I need to cheer up, I listen to *Hallelujah*. So far, I've listened to your album on Spotify, but I definitely plan to buy the album so I can roll down the windows and sing horribly to all of the songs in the car. \n\nThank you for answering our questions!

Did you watch it? If you did or decided to after reading this, what did you think of their reactions?

The genre-bendy-ness of your albums inspired me to branch out into listening and eventually LOVING so many different types of music.\nYou're actually a personal hero and role-model of mine, to be perfectly honest. I appreciate you on so many levels! When you're candid about your anxiety and making the decision to be happy, and fun-loving instead of \"too cool for school\" or whatever motivated me to start making similar changes.

So she said yes and it had she happens to be a HUGE fan of you and your music and so I decided to see what I missed from Panic over the years. Damn I did miss a lot and I know it's a very recent song, but Death of a Bachelor just felt so right to me! the whole 50's vibe it gave me was amazing and so I asked her to give me some pointers on other songs to check out that she had in mind for me.\n\nNow I'm slowly building up my playlist of all the great music you've made. I honestly can't thank her and you enough. Sadly she told me the whole \"Let's take a break thing\" and so I've been feeling down, but your music has been keeping my spirits up (sorry for the pity story).

At The Disco?**\n\n**Also if you ONLY if you want could you make a short video of you saying \"Hey Calah!

Since A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, I listened to Panic! since then. Even with all that stuff/shit that happened, I'm still here to listen.\n\nWhen I was 6, I started listening to Panic! Even up to now, when I told  everybody that, they were like, you were too young for that shit. Then you had your concert here (Manila). Back in 2008, and of course I had no idea what a concert is, so I didn't go. And oh, #ManilaWantsPATD, just saying.\n\nI love all of your music, the feels and the chills to it. The feeling when it is the first thing I listen to in the morning, before I go to school, it's everything. (I know, I suck at writing, especially this. Sorry.)\n\nBrendon Urie, I know you said this before, but your own message is really meant for you.\nYOU are great, YOU are talented, and smart, and kind, and loving, and generous, and simply amazing. God, I can't get that out of my head. Thank you.\n\nSo Yeah, maybe that's all there is to it.

Being a fan from when \"A fever you can't sweat out\" was released, I could really tell the difference in how the songs progressing and I think you now being solo played a huge part in the album, not only in terms of effort but in terms of style and like I said, applying to new auidiences!\n\n\nSince the band broke up I always wondered how it would affect the development in music and I would love to know! \n\n\nThings may have shaped things up to be pretty odd, but you did swear to shake it up!

You have a huge fan base here.\n\n2. how different was writing this album as opposed to too weird?\nand a  lot of reviews have said that \"impossible year\" has a touch of frank sinatra, did it inspire you to write the song? \n\n3.  Every album has produced a very different sound from the previous, and as a result you have a very unique fan base, many of whom like one Panic! sound but not another. What do you say to fans who perhaps are only willing to listen to A Fever or only Too weird , and how has this type of fan base effected your creative process for making doab?\n\n4. in the song, la devotee the main focus is los angeles and its life style. would you say that your glorifying the los angeles trend and life style or are they just metaphors according to you? \n\n5. if you were to sing only one song from the album for the upcoming tour what would it be?\n\n6. What artists and inspirations did you draw from for the new album? Do you ever feel much pressure from others to try to steer you in a certain way, be it critics or fans?\n\n7. what inspired you to make the art work for the album?\n\n8. What does the line \" I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work\" refer to? \n\n9.  if you could bring any celebrity back from the dead, who would you pick?\n\n10. where there any real life experiences/ moments masked in a song in this album? and if so, what were they?\n11. Why did you use the year \"1979\" in the song golden days?\n12. any early touring stories that you'd like to share? \nThank you so much for doing this AMA and may I tell you how much I love your periscopes and vines and I hope you do them again soon.

I'm *so* excited that you're doing an AMA! I've loved your band pretty much since 2005. \n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1. *This is Gospel* is my favorite song from you, as I am sure it is for many because everyone can relate to the song in so many ways. Others say it talks about suicide (I think about a struggling relationship and learning to let go.) It's truly amazing when you can write a song and it can touch so many people who are struggling through so many different problems. \"And truth be told, I never was yours.\" always gets me. It's such a flexible and powerful song that it never fails to inspire a massive range of emotions and thoughts. **Is there a song that has had such a meaningful impact on you that it became unique and personal, like the musician had written it just for you?**\n\n2. It's been interesting and awesome to see you evolve as a musician, but still keep your original and unique style. Every album seems to have a different theme to it, but each never fails to send some sort of message. **Overall, what message do you think this album has sent to the world?**\n\n3. **As a book lover, what is your favorite book? Also, are you a fan of poetry, and has it ever inspired any part of your music?**\n\n\nAnd I have to just say this:\n\nI can still remember when *I Write Sins Not Tragedies* came on the radio, and I became a fan immediately. When *Pretty. Odd.* came out, I would sit outside in the summer evenings and listen to it while I watched the sunsets fade and the stars come out. It's one of my fondest memories. I'm going to the beach this spring, and I plan to do the same thing. In addition, I just have to say *End of All Things* is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. I have absolutely fallen in love with the *Death of a Bachelor* album--it has such a jazzy elegance to it! I love the Sinatra feel. My favorite song(s?) is a tie between *House of Memories* and *Impossible Year*. Yet, anytime I need to cheer up, I listen to *Hallelujah*. So far, I've listened to your album on Spotify, but I definitely plan to buy the album so I can roll down the windows and sing horribly to all of the songs in the car. \n\nThank you for answering our questions! On a side note: I desperately hope that you're one of those artists who will keep writing songs for the world as long as you live. :)\n\nEdit: fixed the formatting.

It's called Emperors New Clothes (as of now) and we would love it if you would check it out or if we could get you a copy of the full story / script. It's been so fun to write and we all are very proud of it. We are on YouTube as SavoieFilmsEugeneProductions and we have an introductory video up for now. Please let us know what you think!

Odd. and even Vices and Virtues has been washed out by \"radio friendliness\" - cookie cutter chord progressions, contrived trap hi-hats, etc. Do you honestly feel that the new direction of the band's sound has been organic, or has it been influenced by the desire to remain popular?

What are the advantages and challenges of Panic! just being you? \n2. I met Chuck Palahnuik (author of Invisible Monsters) at SD Comicon 2015, and I asked him about writing the book. Now I want to ask you about it, because I literally only read it because I found out it was the inspiration behind Time to Dance. How did the book affect you and why did you decide to write a song about it?\n3. How in GOD'S NAME is your vocal range so INSANE??\n4. Do you like Harry Potter?\n5. This is an open ended question.

There is this group called Vitamin String Quartet, an all string quartet that does covers, well they did a whole Panic! cover album.\nhttps://play.spotify.com/album/4xTMI0DynijDk8WD7n3ekK\nWould it be amazing if they did another Panic! cover, and what song off of DOAB would sound amazing orchestral if they did that?\n5. You said in a Pop-Buzz interview that you would have Pete Wentz be the one telling the Drunk History of Panic!, how would that turn out?\n6. Will you do a VicTOURous?\n7.

Thanks for doing this AMA!** First off- I went to your concert in NYC and it was beyond incredible (not that you'd remember but I caught the Kind bar you threw lol) ANYWAY!

Which song was the most enjoyable to write on the album? Did Sarah inspire any of the songs/lyrics throughout the album?\n\n3. How did you ask Sarah to marry you?! Also, how has she inspired you throughout your career?\n\n4. What inspired you to write DOAB?\n\n5. Are there any songs that have been released that you now look back on and regret writing?\n\n6. What exactly is being said in the Nearly Witches intro?\n\n7. When did you decide that you wanted to pursue music as a career? \n\n8. Is it true you got your band name from Panic by Name Taken? If so, what made you choose the lyric \"panic at the disco\" to be your band name? On top of that, what made you choose to add the ! to the name?\n\n\nThank you for answering my questions! (if you get to them). I have been a huge fan for several years now, and I know i'm not the only one telling you this but **your music has saved me**. This is Gospel has gotten me through more than you know and although i'm just one random fan, just know that I think the world of you and that your music has touched me in ways that nothing else has (non sexually haha) I love you and thank you for being such an incredible  human being!!!!

Also, what inspired the lyrics \"Losing the feeling of feeling unique\" and \"It looks like the end of history as we know/ it's just the end of the world,\" because they stand out to me when I listen to the song for some reason.\n\n-When I started listening to Panic, your vocal ability stood out to me (especially in your Bohemian Rhapsody covers and \"The End of All Things\" live). When did you realize how great your voice is?\n\n-Lastly, if one were to buy you lunch, would you be willing to give them concert tickets in exchange?

I'm a new but estatic patd fan, and I absolutely love your music! You have such clever lyrics and beautiful chord progressions. As a semi-song writer myself I was wondering what the order was in which you recorded the tracks for your songs. I was also wondering how you decided what chord progression to use, because I always stick to the basics, but your songs sound so original and amazing and I just would love to know the thought process behind them! On your album I just love all of your songs so much, but one thing that always irked me was how you held that note out in impossible year for a long time. It never resolved and I was just wondering why you chose to put that in there, because I suppose that there must be a reason! I figured it was so people would listen to the other songs again because it was left unresolved, because that's what I do. I really admire your ability as a singer-song writer and I love your powerful voice! Did you ever do musical theater? Anyways, sorry I had so many questions, but I'm just such a big fan!

The lead single is a good example of that and in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ONfa_3zh70&index=23&list=PLuEav-7juj9meLT4eEW75XAoXLp5h16ro) video you get a pretty good idea of all of the different parts and samples that came together to make the song.\n\nOther things to note about that album are his smart (and extensive) choice of collaborators, namely Justin Vernon(Bon Iver) and Nicki Minaj. Kanye knows he's much better at building songs rather than rapping so he relies heavily on features to get a bit more diversity in the verses (good example of that is 'Monster').\n\nThis makes MBDTF a favorite with people that enjoy traditional hip hop, since it combines Kanye's stellar production with some great verses by both underdogs and industry favorites, and it's \"more is better\" approach makes for a lot of surprises and cool twists (plus a ton of replay value).\n\nYeezus, however, is the much more abrasive and weird album. The idea was to have a very harsh, ugly sounding minimalist album to go with Kanye's frustrated lyrics. It's a well known fact that Kanye had alternate versions for most of the final tracks, but ended up taking out more and more parts of the songs with Rick Rubin, focusing more on \"sounds\" (screams, or strange sounding snares etc.) rather than \"harmonic content\"(which would be more \"nice sounding\" chords).\n\nAlthough the production overall is more sparse, he still manages to make very creative choices. An example of that would be 'New Slaves', which only includes drums layered underneath a synth sample and has a time change in the ending when the soul sample kicks in, or 'On Sight', which has a soul sample fade in with a time change and then fade out again randomly for effect. The tracks on Yeezus continue MBDTF's trend of having many parts, and in some examples have barely any repeated parts ('I'm in it', which goes from a verse into what seems to be a chorus, then into a fast dance-hall style part, into a second chorus with Justin Vernon, then into a second verse which drops a lot of elements from the first verse, and so on).\n\nThis makes Yeezus a favorite with people that are into more experimental and crazy music. It's easily misunderstood as being a display of a lack of talent since it's not very 'pleasant' sounding on fist listen, when in reality it's just a step towards more artsy (and definitely more ballsy) music. I personally enjoy it a lot because there's so many things in it that you would never really think of otherwise and that inspire me to experiment as a musician.\n\n\nI hope this helps, holy shit I've typed a lot. Sorry about the whole \"lewronggeneration\" stuff, if you don't like Kanye that's fine, he's not for everyone nor is he infallible. If you want a more \"music theory\" approach to it, feel free to ask, I thought it'd be better to take a look at it from a stylistic perspective since that's what more people can easily relate to.\n\n", "id": "czbgmy4"}, {"comment": "After reading the last part of your comment you sound like an idiot. \"It's harder, you have to think\" yea ok smart guy.

Sounds like late 60s, early 70s, reminiscent of The Doors. They have fantastic music but it isn't what sells in todays market. The genres that are booming now are best suited towards the dance floor. It's 2016, DJing, electronic music and Solo acts are at the top of the food chain. I would advise that you slip in some urban and modern sounds into your recordings, it will help a lot. Also, get everything you record professionally mixed and mastered. You could do it yourself, but a trained set of ears can listen more objectively and hear awful artifacts in the mix that you and your bandmates otherwise couldn't hear because of listening to it 500 times. That, and the fact that they will probably have state of the art equipment and acoustically perfect mixing and mastering environments.

The sooner you start treating your music and image like a brand and a business, the quicker you'll find success. A must read book is \"Everything You Need To Know About The Music Business\" by Donald Passman. This book is industry standard and new editions are always being released in an effort to adapt to the ever changing legislation and structure of the industry. \n\n You and all your band members need to register with Performance Rights Organizations (PROs) such as Broadcast Music, Inc. or ASCAP. There are more but those two are best known for servicing the United States. A nonprofit company called SoundExchange is also essential to collecting any royalties that might be owed to you if your music was synced up with any visuals or included in a compilation, etcetera. CDbaby.com is also a fabulous way to independently release your music under your own label and distribute it to nearly all online music stores and streaming services like iTunes, Spotify, and AmazonMP3 among many, many others. \n\nListening to your songs though, I feel it would be best to try and find a trustworthy and reliable Music Supervisor who could shop your brand and songs around to companies who might need songs, or even just snippets of songs, to sync with an advertisement, movie, TV show or whatever else they might need it for. \n\nNETWORKING, NETWORKING, NETWORKING\nGo out at least once a week and mingle with the musical community. Meet people in the field and collaborate. Get business cards printed and make them flashy. Success in this industry is largely based on solid, long term and trusting relationships with the right people. This is a cutthroat game and a long haul hustle.

Sounds like late 60s, early 70s, reminiscent of The Doors. They have fantastic music but it isn't what sells in todays market. The genres that are booming now are best suited towards the dance floor. It's 2016, DJing, electronic music and Solo acts are at the top of the food chain. I would advise that you slip in some urban and modern sounds into your recordings, it will help a lot. Also, get everything you record professionally mixed and mastered. You could do it yourself, but a trained set of ears can listen more objectively and hear awful artifacts in the mix that you and your bandmates otherwise couldn't hear because of listening to it 500 times. That, and the fact that they will probably have state of the art equipment and acoustically perfect mixing and mastering environments. (I offer quality Stem Mixing services if you ever need it.) \n\nIf you really are serious about your music career, study up on the business. The sooner you start treating your music and image like a brand and a business, the quicker you'll find success. A must read book is \"Everything You Need To Know About The Music Business\" by Donald Passman. This book is industry standard and new editions are always being released in an effort to adapt to the ever changing legislation and structure of the industry. \n\n You and all your band members need to register with Performance Rights Organizations (PROs) such as Broadcast Music, Inc. or ASCAP. There are more but those two are best known for servicing the United States. A nonprofit company called SoundExchange is also essential to collecting any royalties that might be owed to you if your music was synced up with any visuals or included in a compilation, etcetera. CDbaby.com is also a fabulous way to independently release your music under your own label and distribute it to nearly all online music stores and streaming services like iTunes, Spotify, and AmazonMP3 among many, many others. \n\nListening to your songs though, I feel it would be best to try and find a trustworthy and reliable Music Supervisor who could shop your brand and songs around to companies who might need songs, or even just snippets of songs, to sync with an advertisement, movie, TV show or whatever else they might need it for. \n\nNETWORKING, NETWORKING, NETWORKING\nGo out at least once a week and mingle with the musical community. Meet people in the field and collaborate. Get business cards printed and make them flashy. Success in this industry is largely based on solid, long term and trusting relationships with the right people. This is a cutthroat game and a long haul hustle. With VERY few exceptions to the rule, your path to success will be an incredibly slow burn. The main thing though, in my personal opinion, is to just NEVER STOP.

It also helps that I have a good source of income to though, serving/bussing over the weekend gives me around 800 in tips for the weekend, plus hourly, so I am not hurting financially.", "id": "czr6efq"}, {"comment": "Stop thinking about next week's paycheck. You got that one under control. Think about your paycheck 20 years from now. You are, today, laying the groundwork for weather or not you will have one and how secure you will be. Short term thinking will fuck you in the ass.\n\nMusic can provide a reasonable income if you are willing to work, but it's a 7 day a week job that doesn't have downtime and off hours.\n\n>I don't expect anything in return or people to even like it, although it is a bonus if they do.\n\nThen making money from music is straight up not for you. You have to be willing to make the music that people want to hear and that people are willing to pay for. You have to expect to get PAID for your work. You have to be able to know when people will like something or not. If you play a bar for $200 as a four piece, you just made $50 for six hours of work. That's $8:30 an hour before taxes and not including rehearsal or equipment. You have to KNOW that your time is worth at least $100 for the night (and why that's the case), and that the $200 gig is really only a good deal for a two piece.\n\nIf you REALLY want to make a go of it, do it. More people should. Other people covered the more non-performance bits, but here's my advice:\n\n1. CD's don't sell for shit, make sure you have an online outlet for selling individual tracks and promote the shit out of them\n2. Have as many facebook friends as you can, especially other musicians. Follow them on twitter too.\n3. Get a bigass poster that says \"take pics and share on twitter\" with your username on it. People will do it.\n4. Book a gig EVERY weekend with your main band. No excuses.\n5. Find a weekly gig that pays. Church bands are regular but generally don't pay well, but if you do a three piece with keyboards and voice, percussion, and bass then you can make a little money there and it's a regular thing.\n6. Go to every open mic night that you hear about, take a guitar, and play it. Having three songs down perfect that you can sing and play easy is ideal, and going off the beaten path will win you interested listeners. Anyone can play Wonderwall. Not everyone has the balls to show up at an open mic and play \"it's a wonderful day in the neighborhood\" but I've seen it done and everyone loved it. Folk songs do really well too - and they are a shoe-in for #8.\n7. If you play guitar, learn to sing, play bass, and play piano/organ and a little drums. They all take work but you'll be better for it and you can get more gigs.\n8. Coffee shop gigs are low paying, but don't require much effort. 10 songs down pat with voice and acoustic guitar can make you a quick $30 and sometimes more in tips.\n9. Don't smoke, shoot, or drink your fucking money away. I always had a personal rule: any new instruments I buy or whatever are going to be with the money I get from music. It needs to fund itself. It forced me to save my music earnings.\n10. Professional musicians love music - all music. It's OK if there's a few things you don't like, but don't be afraid to play over a wide range of genres. Love the MUSIC first, then make YOUR music. I got started with my band because of a love for the blues and rockabilly, but all of my favorite gigs have been Cajun and Mardi Gras gigs. Go figure.\n\nFinally, read this post that I saved a long ass time ago:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/1zftov/tips_on_making_a_little_bit_of_money_as_a_bassist/cftas09\n\nThat guy knows WAY more than I ever will.

They seem to rely on at least some degree of shock value, which I've appreciated in other artists like Marlyn Manson or Korn or even Alice Cooper though he wouldn't really shock someone in my generation.  ICP, the few times I've heard them seemed to kind of be glorifying hate and violence and mental health struggles.  Now someone else might say they have helped them with these kind of struggles by being someone to relate to.  I had pretty restrictive parents when I was a teenager, even though they were never too unreasonable, so I remember making a few arguments like that about music that they were concerned would exacerbate my struggles.  \n\nIn all fairness though, I'd have to give ICP more of a listen before being too judgmental.

If you simply go out there and ask random people which they like better and play them a piece of Bach or Michael Jackson, you will probably get split results depending on where and who you ask.

(Heck, maybe someone with more vigor than I will create /r/eclecticmusic.) \n\nOne of my favorite lines in one of my favorite songs is \"Baby I was never cool enough to get a job at a record store\" because that kind of coins the struggle. ", "id": "d15vjir"}, {"comment": "You made a really interesting point about how people self-identify based on the music they listen to, and that people who strongly identify with one performer or genera tend to 'fall away' from that music.  \n\nI think you're right, music more than anything seems to be one form of creative expression that people get a lot of their identity from.  But it's interesting how those who base so much of their identity around a narrow spectrum of music will change their listening habits as they continue to live life and age and change themselves.  \n\nMyself, in high school I found what I felt like was an enormous part of my identity in listening to The Doors.  I would listen to them all the time, modeled a lot of myself after Jim Morrison, and basically wanted to live his life more or less.   But now as I'm older, I may still enjoy hearing The Doors here and there, but I don't really go out of my way to listen to them anymore.  It's as if that person that I was, when I listened to The Doors every day,  has moved on and now rather than forming a self-image based around what music I listen to, there are other things I use to define myself.  \n\nStill, sometimes you get those die-hards that are in their 30's and 40's that still get into arguments about which punk bands were really punk, or which metal bands are sell outs and which ones stayed true as though if you have a different opinion than theirs they think you are insulting them as an individual.  \n\nThe moral: eclectics have a stronger sense of identity and are overall more secure and stable.

Of course he's the 'star' of his albums in the same way actors are in films.

When it counts, they are promoted. Beiber's a huge name on his own and he sells the music himself generally, however it was interesting to note that he leaned heavily on two other credible names to help promote his first single after considerable public backlash. \n\nYour examples of the Rat Pack guys is good but the music industry was in a different place. Essentially album sales didn't bring in the revenue that we see these days (that boom didn't happen until names like The Beatles started to emerge) and the audience responded a lot more to hearing 'standards' and traditional arrangements that they do now - we call them cover songs and turn our nose at them because we want to hear something 'original'. So, here we are, manufacturing originality, or the illusion of it, to satiate our need to recreate that feeling that happened in the 60s when the Beatles emerged and blew the music industry wide open. \n\nI remember being in an art theory class and having my mind blown by learning Destiny's Child wrote their own songs (I'm in my 30s now). The difference being, I assumed all pop was manufactured and no pop stars wrote for themselves so I didn't listen. What's changed is I give stuff a chance now. I'll hear a good song and I'll get curious; who wrote it, who produced, where was it written, how was it recorded, who played on it. If I hear a song I respond to, I absolutely love learning about it and geeking out on what I can discover. \n\nSo, yeah, treat is as a chance to learn stuff.

My point was that the conflict arose because one side had a disproportionate amount of authority over the other side and frequently abused the authority that they had.

Honestly I'm more worried about how the Troubles is understood among our own people here than I am about how foreigners understand it - there's such a lack of knowledge on the subject it's unbelievable. For example, most Irish people don't know that the British Army was actually sent into the North to protect the catholics/nationalists from further attacks from loyalist gangs.

I'm not sure I buy that.   It fell out of favor, in part, because of the change in times. But also because grunge was never really supposed to get popular. Being unpopular is kind of the point of grunge. \n\nBut does that mean it doesn't exist? Or that because it's marketed, it isn't a real genre? Isn't that kind of like saying Punk doesn't exist?

Beyond that, there are bands today that are identified as \"grunge\" bands, or at least grunge influenced.  \n\nI think the entire Ten album helps define grunge as a genre. Therefore, I think Release is a grunge song.

One, this is actually your generations music precisely for the fact that what you grew up with sewed the seeds for this type of electro-pop. The formula for pop music is really the same, with the tools slightly changing. Owl city rose to fame when he used these readily available tools and started recording music in his parents basement. He apparently had bouts of insomnia, and to pass the time he started creating his electro pop.\n\nThat leads me to a second disagreement. The only vulnerability in the song is his ability to not fall asleep. The song is not about love or hurt or any teenage romantic journey...the dude couldn't fall asleep. He wanted the aid of fireflies to reach peaceful slumber. If he was really vulnerable he would have taken an MJ approach and taken copious amounts of drugs to reach REM, but he just wanted lightening bugs.\n\nI am not much younger than you. Growing up, I signed up for Columbia House and BMG music Clubs multiple times. One round, I would order a current Beastie Boys album alongside a best of CCR. This leads me to another point of contention. Appreciating different genres and generational music is not difficult, rather it is a fantastic voyage. Pop music has its place as it has throughout the years of radio broadcasting. \n\nOwl City has its place in the Pop Guild just like the big bang theory has its place in the sitcom world. It is easy, orders up, fast food. However you know deep down this is not the best. Not for me, not for society, not for my digestion. But again, it's easy.\n\nMy isssue that I have with your response is that I feel like you are missing out on so much.

I don't jam out to this or whatever. I can just appreciate that it's good music, regardless of whether or not it fits my or your particular tastes. The melodies are creative and the whole song actually works well. Guilty pleasure. I stand by my analysis that this is vulnerable music. It's very lighthearted, childlike, and sensitive in it's expression, which is probably why I equate it with the way some people feel when they first fall in love as young teens. \n\nMy favorite bands are Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Steely Dan, Bad Religion and the ones I'm forgetting today.

I'm sure there are many others that hold this same kind of dismissive view on this song as well as many other things. But that doesn't mean that anyone who shares u/Motafication views are inherently bad.\n\nThere is actually a lot to like about this song, and not all of those aspects are necessarily 'cheesy'. I am a 28-year-old male that often finds himself in the 'nice guys finish last' category, and I feel that Owl City speaks to others like me that never quite feel on par with our testosterone-fueled counterparts. \n\nBut I do still see your point, as rude as it is. To a more 'typical' male, this is pretty fucking cheesy. \"Fireflies\", \"dancing\", \"hugs\", lightning bugs\"; that's very silly and childish. But it taps into an innocence that you once had, and while you may have stepped proudly away from that, some others haven't. And that's just as okay for them as it is for you to shrug all that stuff away. \n\nBut my point is that this isn't garbage. The average pop song usually is. Just queue up whatever pop song is currently at the top and you'll notice that the lyrics are pretty throw-away. But with Owl City, his stuff usually has deeper roots (ignoring \"Good Time\"), pulling inspiration from human aspects like fears and doubts, often from an innocent perspective, and how to stay positive in modern negativity. \n\nBut to each their own. You go enjoy the things you like. You have a right to, after all. But try to keep an open mind when interfacing with something that isn't completely natural to you.

While the song itself is about dealing with insomnia, it is also rooted in that child-like emotional connection with *things*, in this case, fireflies.

I dont wanna go into a fangirl schpiel, he's def. someone that people let their perception dictated by the media of him define what they think of his music without understanding the context.  Hiphop is all about context, alot of what makes rap and hip hop funny and clever is because within the double meanings are sometimes triple meanings that you only pick up if you know the context of that artists's life/relationships both business and personal/associations/where they grew up etc etc etc.  So there's almost like home work for the listener to fully appreciate it they also need to know the context of what their listening to and even then sometimes you pick up on jokes and references years later on the hundredth listen.  That's part of what makes listening to hip hop and rap more of an active activity for the fans vs a passive activity.   Kanye plays into that because he doesn't just layer lyrics, he layers beats in such an intricate way that listening to his music means also trying to decipher his samples and figuring out what is layered ontop of what and where that sample came from.   I could go on he's extremely complicated, complex and multifaceted.  He had a dvd called Late Orchestration where he had the orchestra at abbey road studios do a performance with him of that entire album and this was many many years ago and he's so detailed he even chose the makeup the violinist would wear.  Recently an orchestra in california did a mashup of Beethoven and Kanye called [Yeethoven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdF8Z1hMEwg)  the conductor felt very passionately that there are many similarities in how beethoven constructed his music and how kanye also works his magic.

The current member is vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Brendon Urie. Their debut album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out has sold over 2.2 million copies worldwide, 1.5 million of which were in the United States alone. This shot them into the international spotlight. Their sophomore album Pretty. Odd. debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200.  The band released their third album, entitled Vices & Virtues, on March 22, 2011, while the record's first single, \"The Ballad of Mona Lisa\" was released February 1, 2011.\n\n> Although the band officially formed as Panic! at the Disco in 2004, the first incarnation of the band was formed in 2002 under the name \"Pet Salamander\", with Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson, and Trevor Howell. It was during this time that Ryan Ross wrote \"Time To Dance\" and \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", so some consider the band to have formed as of 2002.\n\n> In 2005, Panic! at the Disco, which at the time included Urie, Smith, guitarist/lyricist Ryan Ross, and bassist Brent Wilson, was discovered by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy, who, after hearing demos the band uploaded to PureVolume went to Las Vegas to hear the band play in their garage. He immediately signed them to his Fueled By Ramen label imprint Decaydance. After their debut A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was released, bassist Brent Wilson left the band. Although he claims he was fired, the other members deny this.\n\n> The success of their first two singles helped catapult their debut album to the top of the Billboard Independent chart and to #13 on the Billboard 200 in July 2006. With Jon Walker filling in as temporary bassist, the band embarked on their first headlining tour through Europe. All of the dates sold out within hours. Immediately after returning, they did the same in North America. On July 3, Jon Walker became the permanent bassist of Panic! at the Disco.\n\n> In early 2007, Panic! at the Disco began writing their follow up album but, after months of work, decided to rewrite the entire album from scratch in July 2007. While speaking to MTV, Ryan Ross explained that, before the decision to start over was made, the album had lacked a band set up and that it \"sounded like a film score.\" He also explained that the new songs have \"a more positive outlook to them.\" On January 9, the exclamation point (!) in the band's name was dropped. They defended the decision to drop the exclamation point during an interview with MTV: \"It was never part of the name to us. (...) When we started doing new promo stuff for this album, we just told everyone not to use it anymore.\" Panic (sans \"!\") later confirmed that the second album was titled Pretty. Odd. with a release date of March 25, 2008.\n\n> On July 6th, 2009, an announcement was put up on the band's official website and myspace page, stating that Ryan Ross and Jon Walker would be leaving the band to pursue their own musical interests. They have since formed the band The Young Veins. \n\n> Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith, however, will stay and continue playing as Panic! at the Disco, with the exclamation point re-added. Fans can hear a snippet of Panic!'s demo entitled \"Oh Glory\" on the band's official website. \n\n> Since the split, Panic! at the Disco joined Fall Out Boy, Blink-182, and Chester French on the first half of Blink-182's summer tour in 2009. They brought along Ian Crawford formerly of The Cab and Dallon Weekes of The Brobecks to temporarily replace Ross and Walker. The band also released a single titled New Perspective which was featured on the Jennifer's Body Soundtrack in August 2009.\n\n> \"New Perspective\" was released on July 28, 2009.[26] Former The Cab member Ian Crawford filled in for Ross on their tour during the summer of 2009. Dallon Weekes, singer/songwriter of the indie band The Brobecks, filled in for Walker on bass on the tour as well.[27]\n\n> The band re-entered the studio during early 2010 and spent much of the year recording their third studio album.[20] On January 18, 2011, the band revealed that their new album, Vices & Virtues, would officially be released on March 22, 2011. The album was produced by Butch Walker and John Feldmann.[28] The record's first single, \"The Ballad of Mona Lisa\", was released digitally on February 1, 2011, with the music video being released February 8, 2011. The band played 2 new, unheard songs \"Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)\" and \"Let's Kill Tonight\" at recent concerts. On March 9, 2011, Panic! at The Disco released a short film titled \"The Overture\" which featured snippets of four, unheard songs: \"Let's Kill Tonight\", \"Hurricane\", \"Ready to Go (Get Me Out of My Mind)\", and \"Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)\". On March 14, 2011, Panic! at The Disco streamed the full Vices & Virtues album on their Facebook page.

Odd. with a release date of March 25, 2008.\n\n> On July 6th, 2009, an announcement was put up on the band's official website and myspace page, stating that Ryan Ross and Jon Walker would be leaving the band to pursue their own musical interests. They have since formed the band The Young Veins. \n\n> Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith, however, will stay and continue playing as Panic! at the Disco, with the exclamation point re-added. Fans can hear a snippet of Panic!'s demo entitled \"Oh Glory\" on the band's official website. \n\n> Since the split, Panic! at the Disco joined Fall Out Boy, Blink-182, and Chester French on the first half of Blink-182's summer tour in 2009. They brought along Ian Crawford formerly of The Cab and Dallon Weekes of The Brobecks to temporarily replace Ross and Walker. The band also released a single titled New Perspective which was featured on the Jennifer's Body Soundtrack in August 2009.\n\n> \"New Perspective\" was released on July 28, 2009.[26] Former The Cab member Ian Crawford filled in for Ross on their tour during the summer of 2009. Dallon Weekes, singer/songwriter of the indie band The Brobecks, filled in for Walker on bass on the tour as well.[27]\n\n> The band re-entered the studio during early 2010 and spent much of the year recording their third studio album.[20] On January 18, 2011, the band revealed that their new album, Vices & Virtues, would officially be released on March 22, 2011. The album was produced by Butch Walker and John Feldmann.[28] The record's first single, \"The Ballad of Mona Lisa\", was released digitally on February 1, 2011, with the music video being released February 8, 2011. The band played 2 new, unheard songs \"Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)\" and \"Let's Kill Tonight\" at recent concerts. On March 9, 2011, Panic! at The Disco released a short film titled \"The Overture\" which featured snippets of four, unheard songs: \"Let's Kill Tonight\", \"Hurricane\", \"Ready to Go (Get Me Out of My Mind)\", and \"Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)\". On March 14, 2011, Panic! at The Disco streamed the full Vices & Virtues album on their Facebook page.

He's not a musician. He falls more into producer/poet territory. He's clearly an excellent business man, but he is not a musician.\n\nHe constantly calls out ACTUAL musicians as frauds, then goes on to release mediocre albums full of contrived messages and regurgitated pop culture. He steals other peoples work, then compares himself to Leonardo Davinci. His fashion line is a joke and like most people, I'm pretty sure his \"designs\" are actually just a bunch of crap one of his lackeys found at the nearest good-will 10 minutes before his \"fashion shows\" are slated to begin. \n\nMy teenage nephews LOVE his albums. I'm unfortunately forced to listen to them on a regular basis. There's nothing new or exciting about his work and eventually? As my nephews get older, they will look back at Kanye they way I once looked back at The New Kids on The Block. Fun for the age, but ultimately embarrassing to admit I once fawned over them and their \"music\".\n\nIf a person has to constantly remind the public he is \"the greatest musician to ever live\", there's a good chance no one's listening to begin with. He's not famous because of his revolutionary new albums. He's famous because people like to watch other people publicly dismantle themselves. \n\nThe day I change my opinion, will be the day Kanye releases a free you-tube video with nothing but him playing an actual instrument, with no production. Until then? He's nothing more than a guy that can clip beats together and speak in time over top some tracks. \n\nFor the record: Kanye is more Pop Idol, than he is Rock-Star. Freddy Mercury was a Rock-Star. Jimi Hendrix was a Rock-Star. Bruce Dickenson was a Rock-Star. Getty Lee, Les Paul, Steve Vai I could go on and on and on. None of the people on this list, are Kanye West. \n\nNo ones making jokes. Kanye legit sucks, he just got lucky and puts on a good enough shit-show in real life that people keep paying attention. His agents will use that up until there's nothing left to squeeze out of him. In another decade? We will be watching him on reality TV and everyone will wonder: \"What happened to this guy, he was such an icon when I was growing up\". \n\nSeparating the art from the artist who created it is like trying to separate the molecules in a glass of water, but still expecting the outcome to be a drinkable glass of water. That's not how it works. For good or bad these people are who they are. Kanye's past isn't the issue. His arrogance and lack of original creative thought is. He's a product of his cushy middle class upbringing and everything he puts out is a reflection of that. No matter how eloquently he words things to make it look like he rose from the ashes of some burned down ghetto.\n\nSorry for the rant, but come on kid. You want actual good music?

because i always wanna be able to improve, i never wanna have that feeling that i've peaked. i know how saturated things are, which is exactly why i'm embracing myself as a unique person as i believe everyone should. for a while i was biting, copying, feeling unsure of who \"i\" was but that's changed and i've finally been starting to embrace myself properly. and it's feeling more solid and complete every single step of the way. thinking about this instrumental in retrospect i really shoulda just found a more varied one to rap over. i actually pretty much never make songs with beats that loop one way and don't change throughout like this one here. i honestly wasn't really trying to make a \"song\" song if you know what i mean. this was mainly an exercise in lyricism and honesty about some shit weighing on my mind. i felt really good about the minimal slow burning beat i went with but i also realize now the lack in variety hurts the song regardless of my intentions with it. i think my main supporters will realize that though so i'm not worried. mainly tho i'm not worried because i'm gonna have many many more songs coming in the future (a few really soon) that'll be a lot more exciting and fully fleshed, dope in all departments including beat choice, production value, lyrics, flow, inflections, everything. i know i have strong songwriting skills and they're getting stronger all the time so i don't doubt any of my abilities for a second. sometimes there are hip hop artists with great voices and great beats but crappy lyrics. or great beats and catchy hooks but nothing else all that appealing. i'm trying to knock the ball out the park in all or at least almost all areas. i fully believe i can do it. i love this shit, i'm not gonna stop until i achieve my goals and get to the place i wanna be. and man, i promise you right now, if i can't live my life and and pay my bills doing what i love artistically, because art is all i honestly got or have interest in, i'd rather not be doing anything. for real.\n\ni actually don't think it's TOO difficult to get some shows lined up and start turning a few heads, especially if you have some money which can earn a few valuable shortcuts. a lot of rappers only make what's hot in the game at any given moment, there aren't really too many originals or innovators. i can't get past 10 if i tried to name some. i'm not really tripping too much on touring before the quality of my music is at that place where it's worth converting into a live show, or before my rep is decently strong and my supporters are fairly large in number and completely organic and real. i'm not the one to take shortcuts or treat supporters like throwaway fans, talk down to them, or tweet out fake publicist-approved messages to them as if i'm some cog in the music machine/industry. it's cool too if people do that, that's up to them and it's their business/not mine. but i'm only saying i'm not about that shit. i fully believe i'll eventually reach that point where i have a strong dedicated show of support at live performances and a genuinely unique brand and sound to offer the world, and a certain sort of reputation where it's my own world i live and rap in, and nobody else is truly in the same sphere - just like what the BasedGod has done but not exactly the same or at that level. one of my favorite rappers is Danny Brown and he only really started getting his due shine when he was damn near 30 years of age. that shit is amazing to me, but after reading and watching pretty much all his interviews i've come to realize that his way of \"making it\" is a great path. he just always remained himself, stayed true, did his thing, KNEW he was dope and unique, and then finally started benefiting and having others catch on and figure out just how dope and unique he was, how valuable his contribution to hip hop is. he's on an indie label (just like how i plan to eventually be) with proper creative control and isn't super rich or famous so he doesn't need to stress over being hassled with and can pay his bills while living comfortably in a more than satisfying crib. and i mean i love good fashion more than the average man (not kanye level but still) but nah i don't do none of that \"haute fashion\" shit. i don't do anything lyrically to try and impress anyone. i go off of what i actually genuinely feel like saying and what i wanna hear back when i play my own music, i make the type of shit i'll enjoy. in short i just be myself, there's nothing forced or any kind of attempt to impress a certain group of people or to hop on a trend to get some quick exposure. those people imo will never make any truly meaningful impact. and that doesn't just include the huge major label artists; indie rappers can make those big impacts as well. i definitely intend to make something of that nature down the line.\n\nand ayyyy this was a LONG response, it think i just typed an essay. but i was just getting really passionate, and it was your detailed/honest reply that ignited it in me. for real thanks for the comment.\n\nEDIT: if you have some time, please check out a song i dropped about a month ago. it got me my first blog love and my first radio play. it aired on a local hip hop show in my hometown on Canada Day. shit was super tight. it's called \"Family\" and here's the link: https://soundcloud.com/tomsolarmusic/family-prod-p-soul", "id": "d5u2p9j"}, {"comment": "You're certainly passionate; keep on going -

It may seem like a bastard child between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown at first but I think just a few listens really give it a better picture. This album is Billie Joe giving us a full picture of what's going on around him. The world is a flaming ball of chaos but  there are the occasional beams of light. He still has his loving wife (portrayed in Youngblood) and he got through some very tough times (in Still Breathing). \n\nI don't think this record is him trying to grab some low hanging political fruit to make a buck off of it. I look at it as 'well, look at all this awful shit around me...but you know what I'm doing ok and it's all going to work out'. Seeing him point out all these things going on his head \u2014 whether it's coming to terms that he can't go back to his past (in Outlaws and Too Dumb to Die) or the chaos in the world around him \u2014 is capped off perfectly by Ordinary World. It's easy to think he's just trying to get a little fame off of another acoustic closer, but for me it's a statement that ends this album. It's like he's saying 'I've been searching for something around this chaotic world and I need to stop because I have everything I need and I've done just fine up to this point'. I think it's a wonderful message of coming to terms and being at peace with yourself and what's going on around you for the most part. \n\nIs this their best release? Of course not, but it's one of their better ones. There's a sense of resolution with this album, unlike the majority of Green Day albums. Outlaws and Still Breathing are two of my favorite tracks they have ever released. I'd probably even put Outlaws personally in my top-ten just because it means a lot to me as someone who's youth has ended recently and I'm learning how to grow up. \n\nI think people just need to stop comparing Green Day's different works. Each of them have their flaws but great things about them. I wish we could just appreciate what each of them have to offer and if they aren't your cup of tea, that's fine. We all have different experiences that let us relate to different works. i.e. Everyone seems to think the trilogy sucks but I thought it was a great. I saw three albums with no direction and it seemed like a mid-life crisis from start to finish. I thought it was beautiful."], [55, "Grew up listening to Green Day, Dookie was the album that inspired me to pick up a guitar at 7 and want to be Billie Joe. 16 years later I've gotten into other types of music with but I'll always have a special place for Green Day and will support any music project they put out. I'm a lifelong fan. My dad showed me The Beatles and I'm going to show my kids The Beatles and Green Day.

Rock on fellas.\n\n"], [44, "I've been listening to Green Day since their inception, and their change has been slow and sweeping. It's been interesting to follow a band that responds to criticisms and accusations of producing commercial punk pop with a middle finger introspective (Good riddance; though there are about 8 valid theories as to the meaning of that song.) I have most of their stuff. Nimrod and Warning had to be fucking scary to put out. They had to know they were departing completely from some of their fan's tastes and I'm glad they did. They grew as I grew, and it was neat. I don't like everything they've ever done, but I'm ok with what they sound like now.

And unlike other bands, they have been able to maintain popularity and a fan base. They aren't even the same band anymore.\n\nIt's actually kind of fascinating. But they released American Idiot exactly 10 years after Dookie. So they blew up with Dookie and became a huge world wide success. Then 10 years later they completely revived their career with their most successful album to date.\n\nThe reason this is important, is that it introduced Green Day to a new generation, and helped revitalize their success (in ways that most bands don't see). So no, it really isn't nostalgia, they are a successful band with an active fan base (one that is pretty diverse age wise).\n\nNow if you hate them; that is completely valid. That is a whole different discussion.

Dookie remains as one of my favourite albums from the era, it feels extremely raw and passionate.\n\nBut their most artistically realized album has to be American Idiot. It took me growing up to understand just how good the album was. It's a great piece of Rock Opera with, in my opinion, a rather great story that also leaves some details up to the listener which makes it feel more personal and relatable. I mean, hell, it got made into a [Broadway Musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idiot_\\(musical\\)). [Jesus of Suburbia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA8v3B1SxR0) alone I would say makes the album a must-buy, and it also features what I consider to be their most critically underrated song (by fans, I get that it's not that strong of a song independently), [Whatsername](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2LC1xrdOaM). It perfectly encapsulates how it feels to grow up and move on from that punk/rebellion phase.

But it also had a lot of mediocre songs. Out of the context of the chaos of the  album, 21 Guns was boring AF. Know Your Enemy was just plain dull. Murder City always seemed like a mess to me, and I get that it's kind of what they were going for, but Mass Hysteria/Modern World seemed like it focused too much on chaos.\n\nWhat you'll notice is I put their 2 most popular singles from the album in the bad list. As time has gone on they've made more of those, less East Jesus Nowheres and basically no Viva La Glorias. They've gone from a spicy curry to a generic stew. Nobody really complains about eating stew but even if you make 5 star stew it's still a fucking stew.\n\nRevolution Radio is like this depressing, distorted image of what I liked about American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown if you look at those albums thinking that Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns were the high points of the latter album. It doesn't flat out bore me like the trilogy but it's more disappointing because dammit they are clearly demonstrating they know that that era's sound was good, but they just aren't doing that sound in the way that I loved, they're doing it in the way the radio loved.\n\nTl;Dr 21CB was real good but also had bad points, RevRad sounds like the bad points from it and AI.\n\nTl;DrtTl;Dr American Idiot was great but RevRad is more September than Jesus of Suburbia.", "id": "d8wztdl"}, {"comment": "Oh boy, here we go.  IMHO, Green Day was a phenomenal 90's punk band for all the reasons you have said.  *American Idiot* was their nadir album.

In 2004 the Bush administration (regardless of politics) was officially the easiest fucking comedy/edgy protest rock target of all time.  *American Idiot* was demarcation point at which it officially became lame to complain about Bush.  It was manufactured music to the youth saying 'hey isn't the administration/government lame?!?!?!?!', when The Daily Show and similar media had been beating that drum for awhile.  Mind you their music didn't really have anything significant to say other than to voice general malaise/repeat the same things that other media formats had already said (in contrast to specific topics voiced by RATM or 90's punk rock).

It's a concept album telling the story of a young man from what I assume are his teen years to adulthood. This goes from Jesus of Suburbia to Whatsername.

But to the part where you said they abandoned their previous sound, I would say they kind of had to. As I said elsewhere, Warning was already a bit of a departure and a sign of them leaving their angsty years. Rather than talk about bringing down the establishment and how much they hate everything, Green Day instead made an album about growing out of that phase of your life. And I think they were the perfect people to do it, as I'm sure they were wrestling those feelings themselves at the time.\n\nI would compare American Idiot to the album Undun by The Roots.

But it doesn't have answers to these problems. How could it? These are huge, complicated issues that can't be settled by protests and drugs and 'saviours'. And in the end the album recognises that. 'Whatshername' which concludes the album is, to me, the protagonist looking back years later at the whole situation. He remembers some things, but cant recall the rage and angst because he's grown up. He's not a rebellious teenager anymore.\n\nI always see this album as a very good tale of life for my generation (i was 15 when it came out.) After 9/11 suddenly our lives were dominated by huge political issues and fear mongering on a grand scale. And you felt rageful, you felt angsty, you wanted it to change. But you grow up. You realise how complex things are and how little you can change anything. And you just try to live your life.\n\nSo yeah i do think its has pretty shallow politics.

It may seem like a bastard child between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown at first but I think just a few listens really give it a better picture. This album is Billie Joe giving us a full picture of what's going on around him. The world is a flaming ball of chaos but  there are the occasional beams of light. He still has his loving wife (portrayed in Youngblood) and he got through some very tough times (in Still Breathing). \n\nI don't think this record is him trying to grab some low hanging political fruit to make a buck off of it. I look at it as 'well, look at all this awful shit around me...but you know what I'm doing ok and it's all going to work out'. Seeing him point out all these things going on his head \u2014 whether it's coming to terms that he can't go back to his past (in Outlaws and Too Dumb to Die) or the chaos in the world around him \u2014 is capped off perfectly by Ordinary World. It's easy to think he's just trying to get a little fame off of another acoustic closer, but for me it's a statement that ends this album. It's like he's saying 'I've been searching for something around this chaotic world and I need to stop because I have everything I need and I've done just fine up to this point'. I think it's a wonderful message of coming to terms and being at peace with yourself and what's going on around you for the most part. \n\nIs this their best release? Of course not, but it's one of their better ones. There's a sense of resolution with this album, unlike the majority of Green Day albums. Outlaws and Still Breathing are two of my favorite tracks they have ever released. I'd probably even put Outlaws personally in my top-ten just because it means a lot to me as someone who's youth has ended recently and I'm learning how to grow up. \n\nI think people just need to stop comparing Green Day's different works. Each of them have their flaws but great things about them. I wish we could just appreciate what each of them have to offer and if they aren't your cup of tea, that's fine.

Eardrum-bursting, dagger-in-the-eyes, ass-bagging, blow your fucking brains out \u2014 unadulterated dog shit.  That pretty much sums up the type of music that\u2019s popular with today\u2019s young people.\n\nListen, you stupid sons of bitches.  I\u2019m talking at you.  I\u2019m your elder.  My opinion demands respect.\n\nYour music hasn\u2019t got life.  It\u2019s fucking dead.  Your music is void of humanity.  It\u2019s as fake as a porn queen\u2019s orgasm.  There\u2019s no soul.  It\u2019s tripe.  It\u2019s a carp in the sea of music.  The stuff you listen to was created by fucking machines.\n\nToday\u2019s \u201cartists\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s an oxymoron \u2014 don\u2019t even need to know how to play musical instruments or sing.  In other words, no fucking talent whatsoever is needed to succeed today in music. You heard me.  No.  Talent.  Whatsoever.\n\nAnd, I\u2019m fucking sick of it because the current generation is taking the gold we gave you and dragging it into a sewer.\nListen up, you little pricks.  I\u2019m not stuck in some kind of classic rock time warp.  Fact is, I expose myself to many different kinds of music.  I give all music a chance.  Even the techno-trash littering the modern music scene is something I\u2019ve tried to digest, which I found to be like choking down a plate of raw oysters laced with salmonella.\n\nIt would be nice to enjoy fresh musical acts.  I want to hear new songs.  I like some young people, especially when they get my order right.  But real music is written and performed by humans, not a fucking computer program linked up to a laser show.\nFact:  The more fancy gadgets and distractions you need, the most your music just flat out sucks.\n\nMusic should convey some sense of humanity \u2014 who we are, and what we feel.  I know that\u2019s a hard concept to digest since your idea of a relationship is picking up a new Twitter follower.  Where\u2019s the love and romance in the mind-numbing rubbish that\u2019s played at most nightclubs?  Is there any conveyance pain and loss?  Or pride and joy?  How about playing a catchy tune that\u2019s just fun to sing along with?\n\nIs that too much to fucking ask?\n\nI don\u2019t expect to like everything that\u2019s new.  As an amateur observer of the human condition, I freely acknowledge that successive generations are obliged to a continuation of the species which sometimes entails pushing boundaries and violating the preferences of their elders.  History shows the more radically different one generation is from one to the next, the greater degree of innovations are sparked from such permutations.  Music is just one by-product of inevitable cultural and technological shifts, sometimes mislabeled as advances.\n\nYes, yes, yes!  New music should piss off plenty of parents and leathery jokers like me.  At least I\u2019ll accept \u201ccultural evolution\u201d as being inevitable, and necessary.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe this, take a look at the past century.  Nearly a hundred years ago, traditional musicians hated a new sound called jazz.  Later, jazz loyalists despised rock n\u2019 roll and even the early sound of Motown.  After that, the rockers hated disco music.  Then, just about everyone hated New Wave and the 1980\u2019s.  Next came rap music which irritated everyone over the age of 30.  Now, it\u2019s hip hop and something called dubstep, which is essentially music made by computers and sound-making software.  This garbage makes rap sound like fucking Amadeus.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason this \u201cmusic\u201d is used as a weapon on suspected terrorists, forcing them to wear earphones and being bombarded with such abuse for hours.  I\u2019m not making this up.  This is the brain-frying shit they put on the headphones and strap to the ears of prisoners who are handcuffed behind their backs and sit naked in jail cells while they are forced to endure this madness.  I\u2019d rather blow my fucking brains out, and if I ever did managed to get out, I\u2019d be running off to join the nearest terrorist cell in order to extract my revenge.\n\nHave a listen this rubbish (CLICK BELOW) if you can stand it for more than a few seconds:\n\n&lt;Broken Link&gt;\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking.  You want to go after my music.  You want to blast away at me.  Go ahead, fuckers.  See if you can top what I like at the conclusion of this article.  You\u2019re drawing so fucking dead you should even be in my game.\n\nSo, what constitutes real music?  Here\u2019s a list of things I believe to be essential.\n\nREAL MUSIC DEFINED BY NOLAN DALLA:\n\n(1)  Real music is created by humans, not by a machine or a computer.\n\n(2)  Real music has structure and consistency.\n\n(3)  Real music elicits real emotions \u2014 of love, loss, anger, fear, happiness, hope, inspiration, or anything related to the gambit of being human.\n\n(4)  Real music requires talent.\n\n(5)  Real music requires instruments and/or voices.\n\n(6)  Real music should be cross generational.\n\n(7)  Real music shouldn\u2019t need gadgets or special effects to be enjoyed.\n\nHere and now, I\u2019ll leave you with a video clip of real music (CLICK BELOW).  When one of those fucking machines creates a sound that can somehow match this magical majesty, then give me a call.  Until then, don\u2019t label what you listen to as \u201cmusic.\u201d  It\u2019s not music.  It\u2019s garbage.\n\n[Luciano Pavarotti - Nessun Dorma (1080pHD)](http://www.nolandalla.com/25-music-listen-fucking-garbage/)"], [-1, "You always have to be a bit careful complaining about the 'younger generations' because people have been doing that for thousands of years.

Eardrum-bursting, dagger-in-the-eyes, ass-bagging, blow your fucking brains out \u2014 unadulterated dog shit.  That pretty much sums up the type of music that\u2019s popular with today\u2019s young people.\n\nListen, you stupid sons of bitches.  I\u2019m talking at you.  I\u2019m your elder.  My opinion demands respect.\n\nYour music hasn\u2019t got life.  It\u2019s fucking dead.  Your music is void of humanity.  It\u2019s as fake as a porn queen\u2019s orgasm.  There\u2019s no soul.  It\u2019s tripe.  It\u2019s a carp in the sea of music.  The stuff you listen to was created by fucking machines.\n\nToday\u2019s \u201cartists\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s an oxymoron \u2014 don\u2019t even need to know how to play musical instruments or sing.  In other words, no fucking talent whatsoever is needed to succeed today in music. You heard me.  No.  Talent.  Whatsoever.\n\nAnd, I\u2019m fucking sick of it because the current generation is taking the gold we gave you and dragging it into a sewer.\nListen up, you little pricks.  I\u2019m not stuck in some kind of classic rock time warp.  Fact is, I expose myself to many different kinds of music.  I give all music a chance.  Even the techno-trash littering the modern music scene is something I\u2019ve tried to digest, which I found to be like choking down a plate of raw oysters laced with salmonella.\n\nIt would be nice to enjoy fresh musical acts.  I want to hear new songs.  I like some young people, especially when they get my order right.  But real music is written and performed by humans, not a fucking computer program linked up to a laser show.\nFact:  The more fancy gadgets and distractions you need, the most your music just flat out sucks.\n\nMusic should convey some sense of humanity \u2014 who we are, and what we feel.  I know that\u2019s a hard concept to digest since your idea of a relationship is picking up a new Twitter follower.  Where\u2019s the love and romance in the mind-numbing rubbish that\u2019s played at most nightclubs?  Is there any conveyance pain and loss?  Or pride and joy?  How about playing a catchy tune that\u2019s just fun to sing along with?\n\nIs that too much to fucking ask?\n\nI don\u2019t expect to like everything that\u2019s new.  As an amateur observer of the human condition, I freely acknowledge that successive generations are obliged to a continuation of the species which sometimes entails pushing boundaries and violating the preferences of their elders.  History shows the more radically different one generation is from one to the next, the greater degree of innovations are sparked from such permutations.  Music is just one by-product of inevitable cultural and technological shifts, sometimes mislabeled as advances.\n\nYes, yes, yes!  New music should piss off plenty of parents and leathery jokers like me.  At least I\u2019ll accept \u201ccultural evolution\u201d as being inevitable, and necessary.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe this, take a look at the past century.  Nearly a hundred years ago, traditional musicians hated a new sound called jazz.  Later, jazz loyalists despised rock n\u2019 roll and even the early sound of Motown.  After that, the rockers hated disco music.  Then, just about everyone hated New Wave and the 1980\u2019s.  Next came rap music which irritated everyone over the age of 30.  Now, it\u2019s hip hop and something called dubstep, which is essentially music made by computers and sound-making software.  This garbage makes rap sound like fucking Amadeus.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason this \u201cmusic\u201d is used as a weapon on suspected terrorists, forcing them to wear earphones and being bombarded with such abuse for hours.  I\u2019m not making this up.  This is the brain-frying shit they put on the headphones and strap to the ears of prisoners who are handcuffed behind their backs and sit naked in jail cells while they are forced to endure this madness.  I\u2019d rather blow my fucking brains out, and if I ever did managed to get out, I\u2019d be running off to join the nearest terrorist cell in order to extract my revenge.\n\nHave a listen this rubbish (CLICK BELOW) if you can stand it for more than a few seconds:\n\n&lt;Broken Link&gt;\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking.  You want to go after my music.  You want to blast away at me.  Go ahead, fuckers.  See if you can top what I like at the conclusion of this article.  You\u2019re drawing so fucking dead you should even be in my game.\n\nSo, what constitutes real music?  Here\u2019s a list of things I believe to be essential.\n\nREAL MUSIC DEFINED BY NOLAN DALLA:\n\n(1)  Real music is created by humans, not by a machine or a computer.\n\n(2)  Real music has structure and consistency.\n\n(3)  Real music elicits real emotions \u2014 of love, loss, anger, fear, happiness, hope, inspiration, or anything related to the gambit of being human.\n\n(4)  Real music requires talent.\n\n(5)  Real music requires instruments and/or voices.\n\n(6)  Real music should be cross generational.\n\n(7)  Real music shouldn\u2019t need gadgets or special effects to be enjoyed.\n\nHere and now, I\u2019ll leave you with a video clip of real music (CLICK BELOW).

There was a very marked divide in our school over the type of music you listened to.

They were not 'popular', to say the least. \n\nThen Mechanical Animals released, and 'the Dope Show' was the title track being played on radio + music channels. The departure from 'industrial-goth-rock' to bowie-inspired 'glam rock dandies' was too much for the average fan. The goth kids pretty much universally denounced the new album and Manson as having 'lost it', and so they moved on.\n\nDespite 'the Dope Show' actually being somewhat catchy, it was this complete 180 from the artist that grabbed my interest. I went out and purchased M.A as my first non-hiphop album. I brought it home, put it in my CD-ROM, and ... something weird happened.

If you watch that Rock AM Ring live performance from like 1997? that's on YouTube, he's flipping off the sound guy, screaming at Ginger Fish for not starting the song, swinging his mic stand at people on the side of the stage, etc.  The crowd's there to be offended and flipped off, but the stage crew and his own band shouldn't need to put up with that shit.

There was a very marked divide in our school over the type of music you listened to. This was the pre-napster era, mind you; when people were very much invested in the type of the music they listened to, and dressed accordingly. It was never hard to spot the Manson fans. They were not 'popular', to say the least. \n\nThen Mechanical Animals released, and 'the Dope Show' was the title track being played on radio + music channels. The departure from 'industrial-goth-rock' to bowie-inspired 'glam rock dandies' was too much for the average fan. The goth kids pretty much universally denounced the new album and Manson as having 'lost it', and so they moved on.\n\nDespite 'the Dope Show' actually being somewhat catchy, it was this complete 180 from the artist that grabbed my interest. I went out and purchased M.A as my first non-hiphop album. I brought it home, put it in my CD-ROM, and ... something weird happened. (other than my parents becoming somewhat horrified when they saw the cover art!) It had some odd program on it that would auto-run when put in the computer, and it opened up some oddball sound/video multi-media art project, rather than just playing the actual album (it's been decades since then, my recollection of the details are a bit fuzzy). At the time, I had never seen anything like that, and remember being quite impressed with Manson-as-an-artist.

Here's something for you from someone who knows a bit too much about this song:  \n\nThe song itself is named in memory of the day that Ian Curtis of Joy Division died.  His passing ended Joy Division, which by all accounts was just on the cusp off breaking out.  The remaining members of the band picked themselves up and reformed as New Order.  \n\nBlue Monday didn't start life as a song.  It started out as filler.  New Order hated, *HATED* doing encores.  So they triggered some of their gear to automatically play something to keep the punters entertained.  It's the drum beat you can hear for the first 15 seconds or so.  It was designed to be monotonis and repetitive.  Keep the audience quiet, bore them a bit and have them disperse so they wouldn't ask for more and the band could start drinking earlier.  \n\nBut the beat sounded kinda'...cool.  So they added to it.  A sequencer was triggered to play, and they had the beginnings of a song.  The band put some other bits together and headed to the studio.  \n\nBefore they started recording, they decided to get high.  Very high.  The band laid down their parts, and were then sent across the street to a pub so the producer and engineers could finish the song without them around.  \n\nIt was pressed onto a 12 inch, which allowed it to be played at high volume while still keeping that fat bottom end (for the time), and not losing sound quality.  It also came out around the time that clubs started featuring DJ's instead of bands.  And when DJ's started playing this song it hit HUGE.  A big, loud song you could dance to!  \n\nThe label - Factory Records - pushed this hard, and really did up the packaging and cover art.  With all that behind it, Blue Monday became the biggest selling 12 inch in history, moving well over 3 million copies.  However, the art was so detailed and expensive that they actually lost money on each copy.  \n\nAnd that, my friends is how countless hours of music nerd-dom pays off.  "], [118, "Okay.

We've got rap, alternative, punk, techno, disco, all this stuff, and it's all better-produced and more sophisticated than any of that 30-year-old junk. Plus we've got music videos!\n\n>This is hard to argue with. If you don't care about history, then you don't, and I'll let you go on living your pathetic little unexamined life. If you do, the 60s are a fascinating destination for your mental time machine. It *was* a time of revolution, not just in music, but in art, fashion, politics, lifestyles, technology, everything. And as with any revolution, 60s rock didn't merely witness a rapid transition from bubble-gum AM dance music to \"modern\" FM Audio Entertainment, but a startling orgy of bizarre experimentation that will never be seen again. Sure, these days any band can knock off any damn music it damn well pleases on any damn $400 portable four-track. But it was only in the 60s that you could pick up the latest disc by the World's Greatest Rock Band - the Beatles - and find yourself listening to a nine-minute audio collage, a 1920's Dixieland sendup, a blistering electric blues, a gentle folk ballad, and a slew of brilliantly crafted pop-rock masterpieces - *all on the same disc*.\n\nOne thing that bugs me nowadays, is bands taking breaks or splitting up because one or more members wants to go solo, or worse they want to make music that they \"don't think fits with the identity of the band.\" Bullshit. Music is music. Go ahead and define your band as one-note and incapable of evolving, then make the same damn songs by yourself. Every star with a guitar is not a musical genius. And the sad thing about the Beatles breakup is that you realized they *were* more than a sum of their parts. Solo Paul can be without heft, solo John can be haranguing, solo George navel gazing.

Here's something for you from someone who knows a bit too much about this song:  \n\nThe song itself is named in memory of the day that Ian Curtis of Joy Division died.  His passing ended Joy Division, which by all accounts was just on the cusp off breaking out.  The remaining members of the band picked themselves up and reformed as New Order.  \n\nBlue Monday didn't start life as a song.  It started out as filler.  New Order hated, *HATED* doing encores.  So they triggered some of their gear to automatically play something to keep the punters entertained.  It's the drum beat you can hear for the first 15 seconds or so.  It was designed to be monotonis and repetitive.  Keep the audience quiet, bore them a bit and have them disperse so they wouldn't ask for more and the band could start drinking earlier.  \n\nBut the beat sounded kinda'...cool.  So they added to it.  A sequencer was triggered to play, and they had the beginnings of a song.  The band put some other bits together and headed to the studio.  \n\nBefore they started recording, they decided to get high.  Very high.  The band laid down their parts, and were then sent across the street to a pub so the producer and engineers could finish the song without them around.  \n\nIt was pressed onto a 12 inch, which allowed it to be played at high volume while still keeping that fat bottom end (for the time), and not losing sound quality.  It also came out around the time that clubs started featuring DJ's instead of bands.  And when DJ's started playing this song it hit HUGE.  A big, loud song you could dance to!  \n\nThe label - Factory Records - pushed this hard, and really did up the packaging and cover art.  With all that behind it, Blue Monday became the biggest selling 12 inch in history, moving well over 3 million copies.  However, the art was so detailed and expensive that they actually lost money on each copy.  \n\nAnd that, my friends is how countless hours of music nerd-dom pays off.

Not an airhead pop songstress among them.\n\nSo maybe it's that it's hard for a woman to make it without being shoved into a box with words like \"sexy\" and \"pop\" plastered all over it, and as a result hard for women to make music interesting enough to get on many \"best artist\" lists."], [5, "Well, if a women would sing about how much they rock, life on the road, the chick they wanna bang, etc then I will probably listen to more female artist.  As it is, most of the female artist I listen to are bluegrass musicians who sing about coal mines and such.  The literal subject matter of the song by most women artist is uninteresting to me.  Why the hell as a 32 man am I going to listen to Katy Perry or Taylor Swift regularly?  They might put out a song I enjoy occasionally hearing but that is about it.\n\nI do believe that we can't overlook the fact that men can reach deeper ranges than women.  This is important because a study a few years ago pointed to the ability to contrast low and high vocal ranges in a song is a fairly accurate predictor to song popularity.  See Queen, Zeppelin, Bon Jovi.\n\nAs far as women in the music industry(i.e. writers, producers, etc.) that's just good ole boy sexism.  No real defense can be made for those numbers if accurate.  \n\nFinally, I would say we have to consider the idea of when people start listening to music.  I really got interested in music when I was 12.  Well, 12 year old me wanted to find things I could relate to.

I think it's because men have a wider vocal dynamic/range due to having deeper voices, so there's more variety and I often like less polished sounding vocals which seem to be more prevalent in male fronted bands. I do like many female lead singers, I particularly like male and female vocal interplay a lot where they switch lead/backing vocals (they both complement each other - i.e. Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine, X). My main gripe is that generic female indie folk vocal sound which seems to dominate a lot these days. I think my favourite lead female vocalists have fairly unique styles...e.g. Elizabeth Fraser from the Cocteau Twins, who has very interesting, evocative, slightly idiosyncratic vocals. Also Debbie Harry, Joan Baez are some other favourites. Of course when you go back to the old stuff like Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin  and the old 50s-60s girl bands like the Shangri La's, Ronettes and the real old delta blues stuff etc, then across the board it's on a par with their male counterparts."], [4, "Isn't this true for pretty much every profession in the world?

That is b/c artists mostly sing about their experiences and women will identify themselves more with the story of a woman.\n IMO,this is just lazy. The fact that there are less women in the industry doesn't mean there is a bias. You don't even care to provide any argument that will explain the stats you pulled.You just forced your claim down people's throats.\nIs there a high number of drop outs in the music industry?That will explain a bit given the women are busy studying while the men neglected by the educational system have to find other means to find financial security.

You say that \"Women have to impress men through beauty which is why they are obsessed with makeup, fashion and etc\", then there is no room in your theorem for the fact that the menswear market has doubled the growth of the womenswear market since last year and grown 18% since 2013, and it's predicted that the menswear market will be worth around 40 billion dollars by 2019.\n You are presenting these apparently immutable reasonings that try to fortify your argument of \"male artists are better because males have to be good at things to impress the other gender\", which is a huuuuge overgeneralization that ignores the fact that art isn't a natural occurrence, but one that emerges from mind -- mind being defined by aspects within and without nature. \n\"Women have to impress men through beauty which is why they're obsessed with makeup, fashion and etc\" is a pretty fickle argument because, in your theorem, that would mean 100% of women are inclined to look for attention in a way that is 100% dependent on an individuals education and culture and psychological construction. Yes, there's an immense pressure in Western culture for women to take an impossible amount of care on their looks, but that doesn't mean it'll lead to an effective what you call \"strategies for reproductive success\". It's just the way our culture has turned the desire for affection into a perennial moneymaker. \nBut my point is that saying one gender is objectively \"better\" than the other at creating musical products is very subjective. ", "id": "d6pw537"}, {"comment": "Your argument is not focused on the big picture. Culture is male dominated as nursing is female dominated, it's simply because of the choices either sexes make regarding occupation and ambition. Men are the majority entrepreneurs, music producers, technological innovatorsm, scientists, engineers, and media excutives as a result of their ambition and choices to enter the field. Women have just as much opportunities but they simply are disinterested because women by nature are not competitive against other men in terms of position, power and influence (only a few women are ex Hilary Clinton). \n\nIt's not a huge generalizaton. It's a perfectly justifiable generalization. If you look at the numbers and ask why are there more better artists in the male demographic rather than the female demographic, it can fully be explain by evolutionary pressures from sexual selection and sex biased gene expression at the modern population level. Genes that have reproductive advantages in one sex over the other have higher expression which leads to superior development of the skill the gene facilitates.\n\nIf you deny my argument you are simply looking at it from a social justice political correctness worldview point. From a Darwininan and objective point of view, I am correct. Why male dominate accomplishments is the same reason why humans dominate over other animals, because there is one selective pressure over on group over the other.", "id": "d6q4588"}]]], "4t3sh5": ["How has 'Future' made it so big?

What the fuck, society."], [52, "So, so many reasons. \n\nFor one, Spotify doesn't have deals with musicians, it has deals with their representatives (labels, publishers, etc.). Spotify doesn't have any direct lines to all of the artists they feature, they go through the representatives/rights holders and ideally want as few parties to deal with as possible (easier to manage). If Spotify were to implement such a feature, it would presumably go through the same representatives, who would in turn take a cut by virtue of being the entity collecting the money for the artists. And why would those representatives agree to a lesser share of money going to the artists than they do to, say, the money coming in for streams? Or for album sales? It would be adverse to the interests of those representatives to agree to pay a greater share of money passing through them to the artists. It would also be a complete fucking nightmare to administrate, as they would have to account for all the money line by line attributable to each artist. The nightmare would begin on Spotify's end, where they'd have to deal with everything, but once it was paid out to the representatives (labels, publishers, etc) it would only be exacerbated by having to go through X number of accounting systems with however many transactions and deductions involved in the process.\n\nOk, so why doesn't Spotify arrange deals with the artists directly then? The service features over 30 million tracks, the number of direct deals involved would be astronomical, it's just not humanly feasible to administrate. They want as few aggregate deals as possible, each for as much content as possible, just to simplify things (amongst other reasons).\n\nThen there's the issue of the money, if that is money being \"tipped\" to artists then that's a huge liability for every party that holds it in between the customer and its final intended destination. Spotify is getting sued left right and center right now for allegedly not being able to pay everyone appropriately for just the streams themselves, the notion of taking on yet more money (and liability to pay said money) for other, more abstract notions like tipping... It's just a crazy venture for them to think about taking. Paying out on streams is complicated enough, paying out on transactional tips would exponentially increase their risk factor.\n\nOn top of all of the above, there's the notion of who is the artist? If you want to tip, say, Taylor Swift, then who get that tip? The producers? The songwriters? The managers? All of them collaborated in putting together the final sound recording product, so why don't they have an entitlement to money paid to \"the artist\" via a service that does the business o making those sound recordings available to consumers? There are a multitude of complex contracts involved in getting every song on Spotify put together, not to mention available on the service itself, and each of those contracts refers to money that comes in in respect of the sound recording products being made available to the public. Now you want to throw in tip money that may or may not fall within the terms of ANY of those contracts, and see if they fight about who gets what portion of it? That just sounds like a whole series of nightmares to me, and I'm sure it would to Spotify as well (see risk factor issues above). This also underlines the issue above re money going through the artists' representatives, as again those deals between the artists and their representatives are likely not clearly specific on this type of payment, and so that would cause ambiguity in terms of how payments passing through such entities down to the artists are handled, and ambiguities causes fighting.\n\nFinally, there's better options available for this type of transaction, such as buying the album or Patreon or anything else. Going through Spotify would make it easier for you, the consumer listening to Spotify, but would make it a nightmare for everyone involved in Spotify and the artists' camp.\n\nSo yeah, that's a whole bunch of reasons why not.

And anybody can do so as well!\n\nBasically, an artist can put their bitcoin address in the meta-data so that it shows up on Spotify.

Which would look something like this: ~~http://i.imgur.com/nShAoLI.png~~ EDIT: Here's an example with the QR: http://i.imgur.com/XQRSKZw.png\n\nIn the above links, the string of numbers and letters that's highlighted is the artist's bitcoin address. Anything that is sent to that address goes straight to the artist, which is pretty neat. Now listeners have the opportunity to give something extra, directly to the artist either by copying the address or scanning the QR-code.\n\nThere's obliviously bottlenecks with this: First, you have to know about it. Second, most people don't use bitcoin. Also Spotify uses Flash so you can't really copy anything. Nor do they have an option to show a larger picture of the cover art to make the QR scanning easier.\n\nEither way, if enough people started doing this and it becomes some sort of standard that would be amazing. \n\n\n"], [10, "Because spotify's business model is entirely based around the actual artists receiving a negligible amount of the money generated through the site"], [8, "Ask the band if they accept bitcoins (or another p2p currency).

Oh wait. "], [8, "The subscription fees that you pay to Spotify don't even go to the bands you listen to, so why would Spotify even care for a tip jar?\n\nThe dirty truth is that Spotify's algorithm pools every subscription fee together in one large pie, and apportions it out to individual artists according to their play share.  But this disproportionately hurts small bands, indies, niche genres, and basically everyone outside of young pop artists.\n\nConsider this: if you pay $10 a month, and only listen to one band, then theoretically that one band should be getting 100% of your money, right?  Not so.  Spotify takes your monthly payment, and because of their algorithm, the vast majority of your money goes off to the major label pop acts who happen to be popular that day.  The band you're listening to gets about a half penny per play instead, which isn't enough to support them.\n\nSpotify's business practice is nice, tidy, and convenient for them and their business plan (and makes for nice soundbites, like saying they pay 70% of their revenue to artists), but it violates the social contract that has existed between musicians and their fans since the dawn of recorded music: the ability of the fan to directly support their favorite artist through paying for and listening to their music.\n\nIn the old days, a young band could play a few local shows, sell a thousand CDs, and have enough money to fund their tour and pay for their next album.  When streaming takes over, a local band can shout \"Listen to our Spotify playlist\" from the stage, but to no avail.  Those 200 people in the audience will go home that night and stream the band's entire catalog, and that band will be lucky to pay for their gas for the drive home.\n\nBut bands need to make money touring and selling merch, right?  Sure, merch makes money, but the hard fact is that touring is hideously expensive, and the majority of bands actually lose money on tours.  Touring used to be financed by the sale of CDs.  That cost-to-income ratio never changed, but somehow now that the album sales are gone, touring is supposed to become magically profitable for indie artists?  (True, major artists make bank on tours, but like with streaming, the economics massively favor them.)\n\nAnd then there's the plight of professional songwriters, who unbeknownst to most music fans, are the true talent behind a lot of your favorite artists.  Streaming formulas vastly favor the artists over the songwriters, and songwriter's can't tour, can't sell merchandise, and have no other revenue stream.  That's a topic for an entire other thread.\n\nSpotify offers an amazing service, and to their credit, have turned away a lot of people from piracy.  But until their payout algorithms get repaired, they're killing the middle class of the music business, tilting recording income towards the 1%, and decimating the behind-the-scenes songwriting and producing talent."]], [[{"comment": "A lot of independent artists have a [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) page, and many will have at least some tracks or even entire albums up for free download, with the option to pay what you want for it, and then many will have others you can stream for free but must pay a minimum amount to download.\n\nAnd if you want to throw an artist some cash, buying merch directly from them can be a nice thing, even if you're listening to their music for free. \n\nEdit to clarify: I'm not knocking the idea of putting a tip jar on Spotify.

All $10 of that sale would go straight to you, but your revenue share balance (the amount you owe Bandcamp) would now be $1. Then you sell another album for $10.

What the fuck, society.", "id": "d2sas1l"}], [{"comment": "So, so many reasons. \n\nFor one, Spotify doesn't have deals with musicians, it has deals with their representatives (labels, publishers, etc.). Spotify doesn't have any direct lines to all of the artists they feature, they go through the representatives/rights holders and ideally want as few parties to deal with as possible (easier to manage). If Spotify were to implement such a feature, it would presumably go through the same representatives, who would in turn take a cut by virtue of being the entity collecting the money for the artists. And why would those representatives agree to a lesser share of money going to the artists than they do to, say, the money coming in for streams? Or for album sales? It would be adverse to the interests of those representatives to agree to pay a greater share of money passing through them to the artists. It would also be a complete fucking nightmare to administrate, as they would have to account for all the money line by line attributable to each artist. The nightmare would begin on Spotify's end, where they'd have to deal with everything, but once it was paid out to the representatives (labels, publishers, etc) it would only be exacerbated by having to go through X number of accounting systems with however many transactions and deductions involved in the process.\n\nOk, so why doesn't Spotify arrange deals with the artists directly then? The service features over 30 million tracks, the number of direct deals involved would be astronomical, it's just not humanly feasible to administrate. They want as few aggregate deals as possible, each for as much content as possible, just to simplify things (amongst other reasons).\n\nThen there's the issue of the money, if that is money being \"tipped\" to artists then that's a huge liability for every party that holds it in between the customer and its final intended destination. Spotify is getting sued left right and center right now for allegedly not being able to pay everyone appropriately for just the streams themselves, the notion of taking on yet more money (and liability to pay said money) for other, more abstract notions like tipping... It's just a crazy venture for them to think about taking. Paying out on streams is complicated enough, paying out on transactional tips would exponentially increase their risk factor.\n\nOn top of all of the above, there's the notion of who is the artist? If you want to tip, say, Taylor Swift, then who get that tip? The producers? The songwriters? The managers? All of them collaborated in putting together the final sound recording product, so why don't they have an entitlement to money paid to \"the artist\" via a service that does the business o making those sound recordings available to consumers? There are a multitude of complex contracts involved in getting every song on Spotify put together, not to mention available on the service itself, and each of those contracts refers to money that comes in in respect of the sound recording products being made available to the public. Now you want to throw in tip money that may or may not fall within the terms of ANY of those contracts, and see if they fight about who gets what portion of it? That just sounds like a whole series of nightmares to me, and I'm sure it would to Spotify as well (see risk factor issues above). This also underlines the issue above re money going through the artists' representatives, as again those deals between the artists and their representatives are likely not clearly specific on this type of payment, and so that would cause ambiguity in terms of how payments passing through such entities down to the artists are handled, and ambiguities causes fighting.\n\nFinally, there's better options available for this type of transaction, such as buying the album or Patreon or anything else. Going through Spotify would make it easier for you, the consumer listening to Spotify, but would make it a nightmare for everyone involved in Spotify and the artists' camp.\n\nSo yeah, that's a whole bunch of reasons why not.

But this disproportionately hurts small bands, indies, niche genres, and basically everyone outside of young pop artists.\n\nConsider this: if you pay $10 a month, and only listen to one band, then theoretically that one band should be getting 100% of your money, right?  Not so.  Spotify takes your monthly payment, and because of their algorithm, the vast majority of your money goes off to the major label pop acts who happen to be popular that day.  The band you're listening to gets about a half penny per play instead, which isn't enough to support them.\n\nSpotify's business practice is nice, tidy, and convenient for them and their business plan (and makes for nice soundbites, like saying they pay 70% of their revenue to artists), but it violates the social contract that has existed between musicians and their fans since the dawn of recorded music: the ability of the fan to directly support their favorite artist through paying for and listening to their music.\n\nIn the old days, a young band could play a few local shows, sell a thousand CDs, and have enough money to fund their tour and pay for their next album.  When streaming takes over, a local band can shout \"Listen to our Spotify playlist\" from the stage, but to no avail.  Those 200 people in the audience will go home that night and stream the band's entire catalog, and that band will be lucky to pay for their gas for the drive home.\n\nBut bands need to make money touring and selling merch, right?  Sure, merch makes money, but the hard fact is that touring is hideously expensive, and the majority of bands actually lose money on tours.  Touring used to be financed by the sale of CDs.  That cost-to-income ratio never changed, but somehow now that the album sales are gone, touring is supposed to become magically profitable for indie artists?  (True, major artists make bank on tours, but like with streaming, the economics massively favor them.)\n\nAnd then there's the plight of professional songwriters, who unbeknownst to most music fans, are the true talent behind a lot of your favorite artists.  Streaming formulas vastly favor the artists over the songwriters, and songwriter's can't tour, can't sell merchandise, and have no other revenue stream.  That's a topic for an entire other thread.\n\nSpotify offers an amazing service, and to their credit, have turned away a lot of people from piracy.  But until their payout algorithms get repaired, they're killing the middle class of the music business, tilting recording income towards the 1%, and decimating the behind-the-scenes songwriting and producing talent.", "id": "d2snet9"}]]], "52r8wm": ["Weezer - Only in Dreams [90's Alt Rock]", "2016-09-14 20:12:07", 11, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z53HGc1_ea0", [], []], "4xe8md": ["Sup Reddit it's \u2795 Boys Noize \u2795 AMA", "2016-08-12 20:00:33", 219, "https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/4xe8md/sup_reddit_its_boys_noize_ama/", [[24, "What's it like doing live shows in a world that is dominated by DJs who all seem to play the same handful of songs and don't rely on much more gear than a flash drive and some CDJs?

Huge fan since I first heard Oi Oi Oi back in 07.\n\nOne thing I've felt listening to your songs as opposed to a lot of other producers is that your stuff doesn't feel forced to sound any particular way.  So I was wondering if you care about genre at all and if so do you make albums/songs with a particular genre in mind?  Or do you just make songs that end up sounding good to you without really worrying about what genre it falls under?"], [8, "Alex, \nI'll try my best to be concise. There's way too much I want to say. \n\nWe first (unofficially) met at Hard Summer 2011. I was fairly new to the whole dance music scene and I remember thinking, \"who is this Boys Noize dj?\" as my friends and I approached your stage. Boy was I in for a treat. \n\nMy first Boys Noize experience was, and still is, very hard to describe. Not only was I hypnotized by your techno/electro magic, but I also vividly remember thinking just how different it was. Your relentless style and energy firmly struck a chord and your music quickly became my escape. I really can't tell you how many times I've seen you perform, but every single set has been a unique work of art. Some of my favorites have been: Hard Summer 2011, Hard Miami 2013, Ultra 2013 (live), OMFG 2014, Outside Lands 2014, BNR 10yr Tour (Mezzanine).\n\nI'm also lucky enough to say I've officially met you, was able to fanboy --lol it was impossible not to-- and was able to ask you some of my burning and long-awaited questions. However, today is an AMA so here's a few new ones for you:\n\n1. I love every single side project you've done but can we expect the return of Dog Blood in 2017? Saw Dog Blood at one of the hard events and still can't find my marbles. \n\n2. I was always a fan of your t-shirt collection. Bought myself the \"Random Acid Memories\" shirt after seeing you at OMFG in LA. Do you have one website you like most when discovering new apparel?\n\n3. Do you know when you will stop touring live? The thought of missing your new live set might be the most depressing thing since Donald Trump's presidential campaign.  \n\nAnyway, Mr. Ridha, you've inspired me more than any other dj or music group on this planet. Your sets consistently impress me and I don't think I'll ever get tired of your Yeah/Swoon/My Moon My Man routine. Your versatility as an artist and success as a brand are truly a testament of your success.

Out of all the shows you have played which one would you say has been your favorite?\n\n2.

If you're feeling short on ideas, what do you do to get your creativity going?\n\n2. I recall reading or listening to a event interview with you where you were aaying producers are maybe \"going back to Chicago and Detroit a little too much\" or something. Is there anything in specific you're finding redundant? Is there anything you do yourself to steer away from being too \"classic\"?\n\n3. Do you have any plans/desires to work with another KPop group soon? \"Feeling\" was pretty cool, but I heard they're all starting military service soon.\n\n4. Would you say composition or sound design takes more focus with your music than the other? I imagine it depends per track, but maybe if you averaged them out?\n\nPS - You and Djedjotronic killed The A (Seoul, like nearly 2 years ago) so hard.

Huge fan since I first heard Oi Oi Oi back in 07.\n\nOne thing I've felt listening to your songs as opposed to a lot of other producers is that your stuff doesn't feel forced to sound any particular way.

There's way too much I want to say. \n\nWe first (unofficially) met at Hard Summer 2011. I was fairly new to the whole dance music scene and I remember thinking, \"who is this Boys Noize dj?\" as my friends and I approached your stage. Boy was I in for a treat. \n\nMy first Boys Noize experience was, and still is, very hard to describe. Not only was I hypnotized by your techno/electro magic, but I also vividly remember thinking just how different it was. Your relentless style and energy firmly struck a chord and your music quickly became my escape. I really can't tell you how many times I've seen you perform, but every single set has been a unique work of art. Some of my favorites have been: Hard Summer 2011, Hard Miami 2013, Ultra 2013 (live), OMFG 2014, Outside Lands 2014, BNR 10yr Tour (Mezzanine).\n\nI'm also lucky enough to say I've officially met you, was able to fanboy --lol it was impossible not to-- and was able to ask you some of my burning and long-awaited questions. However, today is an AMA so here's a few new ones for you:\n\n1. I love every single side project you've done but can we expect the return of Dog Blood in 2017? Saw Dog Blood at one of the hard events and still can't find my marbles. \n\n2. I was always a fan of your t-shirt collection. Bought myself the \"Random Acid Memories\" shirt after seeing you at OMFG in LA. Do you have one website you like most when discovering new apparel?\n\n3. Do you know when you will stop touring live? The thought of missing your new live set might be the most depressing thing since Donald Trump's presidential campaign.  \n\nAnyway, Mr. Ridha, you've inspired me more than any other dj or music group on this planet. Your sets consistently impress me and I don't think I'll ever get tired of your Yeah/Swoon/My Moon My Man routine. Your versatility as an artist and success as a brand are truly a testament of your success.

What do you think about the Dutch DJ's? They are doing so great worldwide but for me me it's all shit. I really like the BNR Ed Banger and lektroluv stuff. Why can't we have more dJs like them in Holland? We only have Joost van Bellenn of course. He is the only dutch guy to play some good tunes. What's your opinion on the Dutch is?\n\n2. When are you going to do some more stuff with FeadZ? I know you are good friends. For me you 2 are the greatest(Don't ask me to choose please). I met FeadZ in tokyo and he took me out for an awesome night out, such a nice guy and such good skills behind the decks. \n\n3. Will daft punk tour again in 2017?? It's been 1997 and 2007 so far.

I dig the song structure, lyrics, and the composition.  As many people have stated here, the recordings could use a bit of work.  I went to school for recording music & if you'd like you can PM me and I can give you some tips.  However the #1 thing I'd recommend is to practice practice practice until you can come up with enough money to pay for professional recordings.  It's an investment, and one many artists are unwilling to make because they want a low-fi sound or whatever and think they can do it at home, but if you're serious about this, a professional recording can really up the quality of your sound.  They will correct picking and timing mistakes and string squeaks/buzz, they will have professional quality microphones and mic placement to capture your entire sonic spectrum (important to making a solo instrument fill the entire frequency band, which in turn makes the recording sound fuller), and especially important is the equipment and effects they will have on hand.  If you want a distorted lo-fi sound you can get muuuch better quality using things like tape and tube pre-amps and fancy gadgets like that.  The one caveat is you're going to want to research the studio you go to before hand.  Some people are better at recording rock, others indie etc.  Try to find some recordings that have come from the studio you want to go to and see if they sound like the style you want.  A lot of places will get complacent and start to apply the same formula to every track.  Good luck on your adventure!  Being a musician is fucking hard! Haha  \n  \nEdit: Second time listening through.  It's growing on me!  Really cool, makes me wish I was still working in the recording business.  One more piece of advice: Practice the songs at 1/2 speed or even 1/4 speed and really focus on your picking timing.  Most of it is really on point, but there are some sections when you play fast that the timing gets off.  I'm sure you know where I'm talking about (The Ant Is Dead Now for example).  I want to stress that it's not bad, but it feels a bit rushed.  \n"], [2, "This is a fantastic first effort.  You've got a good sound here.

Ignore the people here criticising the production or the really picky stuff, you've got ages to get that bit right and you can always work with someone else on it too. \n\nBut the immediately obvious thing to me, in terms of the songwriting is the dynamics. If you can take the songs up and down the levels, both in terms of volume and the amount of elements in any one part of the song, then you'll start feeling the structure and flow of the song more. \n\nI really liked the chord progressions too, a lot of arpeggiated stuff so it becomes slightly more difficult for the average listener to follow it sometimes. To complement this I'd look at working a strong baseline in to your songs, giving you more room on the guitar to pick your melody. I notice a couple times the vocal melody and the chord clashed quite drastically, not sure if it's intended but if your singing over a diminished chord, you've got to be sure it all fits. \n\nFor example the first song, you've got that chord sequence taking your d# down to a D, and because it's arpeggiated and on the G string it's the most prominent sound out of the chord, and then your singing over it as well. I like the idea, but if you can execute it slightly better, or look at how other artists use flat 5 or diminished chords you'll improve that area nicely. \n\nBut that's from a short time listening to you.

They explain interfaces on that site. \n\nThere's *heaps* of websites on home recordings, techniques, hardware, you name it.

Or who knows - iphone headphone recording may be the next big thing?\n\n(I should say here that websites like the one above are conventional/standard set ups for recording today, and if you want to get something more niche or retro/antique/unique, set ups can be custom and flavoured any way you like, the recording/editing process can become as artistic/imaginitive as the making of the songs themselves, all you need to do is research, experiment, but understanding how recording works is worthwhile, and a set up like the one in the website above is a very pratical and low cost place to start, would be great for you). \n\nAn actual microphone will do you endless favours.

There's a lot to be proud of but also a lot to work on too. I saw what you said about what you recorded on and that makes this even better.

I dig the song structure, lyrics, and the composition.  As many people have stated here, the recordings could use a bit of work.  I went to school for recording music & if you'd like you can PM me and I can give you some tips.  However the #1 thing I'd recommend is to practice practice practice until you can come up with enough money to pay for professional recordings.  It's an investment, and one many artists are unwilling to make because they want a low-fi sound or whatever and think they can do it at home, but if you're serious about this, a professional recording can really up the quality of your sound.  They will correct picking and timing mistakes and string squeaks/buzz, they will have professional quality microphones and mic placement to capture your entire sonic spectrum (important to making a solo instrument fill the entire frequency band, which in turn makes the recording sound fuller), and especially important is the equipment and effects they will have on hand.  If you want a distorted lo-fi sound you can get muuuch better quality using things like tape and tube pre-amps and fancy gadgets like that.  The one caveat is you're going to want to research the studio you go to before hand.  Some people are better at recording rock, others indie etc.  Try to find some recordings that have come from the studio you want to go to and see if they sound like the style you want.  A lot of places will get complacent and start to apply the same formula to every track.  Good luck on your adventure!  Being a musician is fucking hard! Haha  \n  \nEdit: Second time listening through.  It's growing on me!  Really cool, makes me wish I was still working in the recording business.  One more piece of advice: Practice the songs at 1/2 speed or even 1/4 speed and really focus on your picking timing.  Most of it is really on point, but there are some sections when you play fast that the timing gets off.  I'm sure you know where I'm talking about (The Ant Is Dead Now for example).  I want to stress that it's not bad, but it feels a bit rushed.  \n", "id": "d4vvzgm"}, {"comment": "https://youtu.be/CyfxENosy1k\n\nThank you!", "id": "daj1ja6"}, {"comment": "Thanks for sharing :)", "id": "dajcsk9"}], [{"comment": "This is a fantastic first effort.

Ignore the people here criticising the production or the really picky stuff, you've got ages to get that bit right and you can always work with someone else on it too. \n\nBut the immediately obvious thing to me, in terms of the songwriting is the dynamics. If you can take the songs up and down the levels, both in terms of volume and the amount of elements in any one part of the song, then you'll start feeling the structure and flow of the song more. \n\nI really liked the chord progressions too, a lot of arpeggiated stuff so it becomes slightly more difficult for the average listener to follow it sometimes. To complement this I'd look at working a strong baseline in to your songs, giving you more room on the guitar to pick your melody. I notice a couple times the vocal melody and the chord clashed quite drastically, not sure if it's intended but if your singing over a diminished chord, you've got to be sure it all fits. \n\nFor example the first song, you've got that chord sequence taking your d# down to a D, and because it's arpeggiated and on the G string it's the most prominent sound out of the chord, and then your singing over it as well. I like the idea, but if you can execute it slightly better, or look at how other artists use flat 5 or diminished chords you'll improve that area nicely. \n\nBut that's from a short time listening to you.

I think a better choice would be a good condenser. I like AKG 414s but they're pricey. Shure KSM44s or Audio Technica AT4050s are cheaper equivalents.\n\nAlso read up on mixing and mastering. There's a lot of different schools of thought but there's also a lot of tried and tested techniques. Certainly EQ, Compression and reverb are staples that need care and attention, especially with sparse music like this.

Being a good producer of music is far different from being a good singer/songwriter. You are a good singer/songwriter. You have a lot of work to do before you identify your sound though. That's okay. This is the hard part for everyone.\n\n1. Several of your songs, although solid in composition and lyrics, sound the same. Guitar with a similar strumming pattern, and distorted vocals, which do not sound particularly good all of the time. I don't know if you were going for some kind of Bob Dylan sound or  folk sound or what, but the consensus of this thread, and the first thing that I thought was that the vocals were dry and irritating rather than crisp and comforting.\n\n2. You are not a a good enough musician to rely on your guitar skills alone. People today don't care as much as they used to to hear a a two track song with just guitar and vocals, unless it is absolutely breathtaking. Otherwise it sounds shallow. You can still maintain the artistic direction you are going for while also truly bringing your songs to life with simple bass and drum tracks, or even shakers or maracas or something. See if you can get in touch with any local musicians or producers who can help you. Remember, everyone everywhere doesn't know how hard you've worked. When they hear your music they are comparing it to every song they've heard on the radio or that was produced in a very high end studio. YOU have to compete with that.\n\n3. I've mentioned a lot about what other people want to hear. That doesn't mean I'm a conformist or that I'm trying to get you to be one; rather it means that often the majority is just a statistical representation of what is actually good and works to stimulate the human mind and ear. Don't let anything I've said discourage you. You are the only one who can control the end state of your compositions' sounds. So far you are on the right track, but don't assume that because you are a good musician that you are automatically a good recording artist. \n\n4.

I'm pretty sure the first song I checked out was Famous Last Words. My twelve year old self fell in love immediately. Primarily I listened to the \"The Black Parade\" and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" albums. Eventually, I found this song and also loved it. \n\nI was devastated when MCR announced they were breaking up. In my head, I had already made plans to see them in concert, as that coming summer I was going to two different ones. I just started listening to them, how could they do this?! It sucked, but I continued to listen to more of their songs. \n\nThen, back to grandma. We learned that she was actually suffering from stage four lung cancer. In the beginning of April, the doctors gave her up to four more months left to live. My mom later told me that grandma planned to at least make it to my 13th birthday in June. Of course, I was devastated--but we still had time. There was no final goodbyes yet. And she was gonna be there for me on my birthday! I couldn't complain too much. I just spent as much time with her as I could when we visited the hospital. \n\nShe went through chemo shortly after the diagnosis. Her hair fell out--but she kept a positive attitude about all of it still. Even pulled some of her hair out when I asked her some question--I don't recall what it was--but she laughed about it. (_\"cause all my hair abandoned all my body, oh, my agony ... baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo\"_)\n\nI continued my listening, went about my days as if nothing were wrong. My dad and I, we hid how we felt--still do. Anyways, on April 4th, it was the first time she was put on life support. She wasn't expected to make it through the next couple days. So, a lot of family showed up, people I had never seen, but were relatives nonetheless. All come to say their goodbyes.\n\nShe got through it, though. Tiny and frail and bald and still kicking ass. As my mom and grandpa joked, she would outlive us all. \n\nApril 12th was her birthday, and luckily, we got to celebrate it together as a family, but the extended family had left by then. We got her Tinkerbell cupcakes because they were the only ones available at the store. Also got her some beanies and pajamas. That day was amazing. \n\nThey eventually moved her from the hospital to a rehabilitation center--or was it something else? I can't remember. My mom visited her nearly every day after work. We had plans to see her on the 20th, so when mom asked me on Tuesday if I wanted to see her, I declined. I wish, so much, that I hadn't. \n\nOn the 19th of April, she went onto life support again. My parents left my siblings and I in my other grandma's care while they visited her, but I called my mom by the hour, asking her for updates. \n\nMy parents came and picked us up from my other grandma's by nine. Grandma had died. I cried a little, but I don't think it quite sunk in by that time yet. The next day, I made plans with my aunt to go to the mall. I needed to get out. I also got \"The Black Parade\" and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\". \n\nLater that night, alone in my room, I listened to the songs on my iPod. I started to cry as this song came on, because I finally understood. She wasn't coming home. I'd never see her again, nor would I'd see the ghost of her. \n\nAnd, of course, Cancer came on afterwards. Damn you, shuffle.\n\nMCR helped me a lot through my grieving, and I owe them so much for that.

This is what sold Gerard Way as a performer to me. I still get chills watching this video.\n\nThe Ghost Of You as seen above. I will say, I didn't like it when it originally came out. As an angsty teen, it felt like they sold out. After this they blow the fuck up and I couldn't be smug about liking them anymore. \n\n[Welcome to the Black Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRKJiM9Njr8) was what MCR was always supposed to be. They wanted to be a \"performance,\" they wanted to tell a story, and it all came out in this video. If The Ghost Of You was them trying out \"story-telling\" in their music videos, Black Parade was the confirmation that this is their new direction. \n\nThe shooting of [Famous Last Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxhdhBRP06Y) is so fucking cool. They shot this video and Black Parade back-to-back, the band was completely exhausted. We get the chance to watch them give their last bit of energy into a song that reflects that same idea. They were nearly collapsing by the end of the video, and a few of them had minor burns from the fires around them. \n\n[I Don't Love You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyi0ZfuIIvo) is my favorite MCR song, so I was pretty upset that it wasn't a US single. Luckily, the UK single got a video, and it's the most \"personal\" video of the Black Parade set. I feel it does the best job of portraying Gerard's style of singing. \n\n[Teenagers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6EQAOmJrbw) feels like such a Three Cheers song and the video is a lot like Helena.

I fucking love it, and it's probably one of the more brilliant transitions in music video history. The lineup of ladies watching as their men disappear, all split between Mikey as he glances back, over his lady's shoulder, while the words \"If I fall,\" play in the short bridge, all while the red teaser curtain drops in the background; now that's how you make a music video.\n\nI'm not sure how My Chemical Romance will be viewed in another ten years, and even though I personally found nothing of interest in *The Black Parade*, or *Danger Days*, I think that 2004 would not have been quite as good of a year for music, if *Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge* had not been made, let alone such phenomenal music videos for this, and \"Helena.\"\n\nWhen we regard how music videos should be crafted, even in an age where people seldom care about the video, we should always take a look at the greats. \"The Ghost Of You\" isn't just another video for some random emo band trying to make the cut.

After that, she was staying for the tumor they also found in her lung. \n\nAround this time, I started listening to My Chemical Romance. I'm pretty sure the first song I checked out was Famous Last Words. My twelve year old self fell in love immediately. Primarily I listened to the \"The Black Parade\" and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" albums. Eventually, I found this song and also loved it. \n\nI was devastated when MCR announced they were breaking up. In my head, I had already made plans to see them in concert, as that coming summer I was going to two different ones. I just started listening to them, how could they do this?! It sucked, but I continued to listen to more of their songs. \n\nThen, back to grandma. We learned that she was actually suffering from stage four lung cancer. In the beginning of April, the doctors gave her up to four more months left to live. My mom later told me that grandma planned to at least make it to my 13th birthday in June. Of course, I was devastated--but we still had time. There was no final goodbyes yet. And she was gonna be there for me on my birthday! I couldn't complain too much. I just spent as much time with her as I could when we visited the hospital. \n\nShe went through chemo shortly after the diagnosis. Her hair fell out--but she kept a positive attitude about all of it still. Even pulled some of her hair out when I asked her some question--I don't recall what it was--but she laughed about it. (_\"cause all my hair abandoned all my body, oh, my agony ... baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo\"_)\n\nI continued my listening, went about my days as if nothing were wrong. My dad and I, we hid how we felt--still do. Anyways, on April 4th, it was the first time she was put on life support. She wasn't expected to make it through the next couple days. So, a lot of family showed up, people I had never seen, but were relatives nonetheless. All come to say their goodbyes.\n\nShe got through it, though. Tiny and frail and bald and still kicking ass. As my mom and grandpa joked, she would outlive us all. \n\nApril 12th was her birthday, and luckily, we got to celebrate it together as a family, but the extended family had left by then. We got her Tinkerbell cupcakes because they were the only ones available at the store. Also got her some beanies and pajamas. That day was amazing. \n\nThey eventually moved her from the hospital to a rehabilitation center--or was it something else? I can't remember. My mom visited her nearly every day after work. We had plans to see her on the 20th, so when mom asked me on Tuesday if I wanted to see her, I declined. I wish, so much, that I hadn't. \n\nOn the 19th of April, she went onto life support again. My parents left my siblings and I in my other grandma's care while they visited her, but I called my mom by the hour, asking her for updates. \n\nMy parents came and picked us up from my other grandma's by nine. Grandma had died. I cried a little, but I don't think it quite sunk in by that time yet. The next day, I made plans with my aunt to go to the mall. I needed to get out. I also got \"The Black Parade\" and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\". \n\nLater that night, alone in my room, I listened to the songs on my iPod. I started to cry as this song came on, because I finally understood. She wasn't coming home. I'd never see her again, nor would I'd see the ghost of her. \n\nAnd, of course, Cancer came on afterwards. Damn you, shuffle.\n\nMCR helped me a lot through my grieving, and I owe them so much for that.

", "id": "czqzw52"}, {"comment": "I kind of have a similar story. \n\nAbout a year ago, I was driving and shuffling around on Google music and the song Hurt by Johnny Cash came on. It was a while since I had heard the song, but I remembered it was a cover that Cash did, and that I like it better than the original by Nine Inch Nails. \n\nSo it got me thinking, what other songs are there that are covers that I enjoy more than the original versions? For some reason I thought of Smooth Criminal by Alien Ant Farm. I don't know why, but I just did, and I used to love that song in my younger days, so I can't even fathom at the time how long it has been since I've thought of that band or that song. \n\nNow mind you I am on the way to a friend's house to hang out. About a half an hour later I'm hanging out with my friend and the TV is on in the background. I had just been humming and air guitaring the main beat to Smooth Criminal. My buddy says to me, getting down with some Michael Jackson eh? I'm like not really, I have the Alien Ant Farm cover going in my head. He's like, oh yeah! I forgot about that one! \n\nAnd dead. Fucking. Ass. Not even five seconds later, a commercial comes on for an upcoming movie, and for the life of me I'll never remember the name of the movie because me and my friend were just so gobsmacked that in the commercial, what song comes on other than, yes, Smooth Criminal by Alien Ant Farm. Not Michael Jackson; Alien Ant Farm. \n\nMy friend was absolutely floored, he hadn't heard or thought about that song in at least ten years.

AI and parts of the trilogy still hold a special sentimental place in my heart. \n\nOkay so in 2013 I went to your Chicago stadium show and was lucky enough to get up on stage with y'all to sing Longview. It being the end of the show my voice was gone and me having incredible stage fright I sounded like a chain smoking frog with severe anxiety. Billie, you then grabbed the microphone from me and said \"okay see you later\" *(side note: I never saw you later you bastard)* and pushed me away.\n\n[Here's] (https://youtu.be/xbbw_yZXrUI) the video: start at like 2:48\n\nStill the fucking best day of my life but all my friends said you were being a dick. Can you settle the question of if you noticed I was about to shit myself or you just wanted to save face from an awful pick of the crowd?

What songs off of Cigarettes and Valentines have you recreated for future albums, if any? Do you guys ever expect to make a studio version of that song (one of my favorites btw)?\n\nAlso I couldn't help but go really deep into you guys' material and I found this song from way back called \"World vs. World\" or \"What About Today?\" Now, there's a few low-quality live versions of you doing the song, and I really enjoy it immensely! I found this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSzvXH_caiM can any of you confirm if this is you guys? I'm leaning towards no, but.

Hope the 9:30 cupcakes were good btw.    \n\nAnyway I've got two questions for you guys if that's cool:     \n1) Among your music is there any song that you wish you could do over again or erase from existence?        \n2) Jesus of Suburbia is a huge song and one of my personal favorites.

Around the time \u00a1Uno! came out, there was an interview about the song \"Kill the DJ\" where when asked if it was about hating modern EDM DJs/Producers, I believe Billie said something like, \"Not at all, in fact I'd love for our song(s) to get remixed\", what EDM artist, big or small, would you like to remix any of your songs?

Y'all have gotten me through some really really hard times and I cannot express in words how truly grateful I am.\n\nMy first question is for Mike. We heard when Revolution Radio was announced that you took bass lessons. I was wondering what it was that made you feel like you wanted to take lessons? And who the hell is qualified to teach Mike fucking Dirnt?\n\nAnd for all of you, the trilogy is kind of maligned in what I think is an unfair way. There are some great songs on there and some really heartfelt emotional stuff, so is there any part of y'all that is kind of hurt when it's kind of treated like a joke?\n\nThanks again to the four of you, you're awesome.

Hope to see you in Texas!"], [3, "Hi Green Day! \n\nI've been listening to you since I was 8 (I'm 16) and you have always been my favourite band! I would spend nights just watching youtube videos until I got to see you in concert, which was such a surreal experience knowing that watching those 'green day live' videos would become a reality. I've had a lot of bad mental health problems in my life and I still do, and I can definitely say that the music you guys put out and the energy you produced for the fans has definitely been my companion along the way. \n\nMy question: Has there ever been a fan you met that really stood out to you? That you remember to this day? "], [3, "Hey Green Day!  I saw you guys about a week ago and was glad that you incorporated my friend losing her shoe while crowd-surfing into the song Scattered: \"that's all I got and I ... LOST MY SHOE\".  You made our night by doing so (not that being there wouldn't have made our night already).\n\nBut one question: how exactly do you change from half-step to standard tuning from one song to another?  I know you change guitars a lot, but sometimes you'll go from a song from half-step to standard (or vice-versa) and not do so.

We went to a concert together, then another one (Bologna where we didn't get to see you in 2012), then bought tickets for another one a year later but dad died before we could see you. Your music reminds me of him and helped me a lot in getting over his death. Thank you. "], [2, "Hey Green Day, congrats on the release of Revolution Radio! Thoroughly enjoyed it and it spoke volumes to me. Still Breathing connected with me and what's going on in my life right now and what has been in the past, with my dad being out of the picture most of my childhood and my mam struggling with alcohol addiction. Growing up in the family as a outcast was really really tough for me, my brother getting all of the praise yet he was abusive and addicted to alcohol and drugs at one point and me being the straight edge kid yet still being ignored was upsetting... You're music helped me through that dark time and even to this day when I feel depressed or low I know that you're music will lift my spirits and give me a reason to be happy again. I know this is a Ask Me Anything thread but I just wanted to take the time and say thank you for not only being there for me when nobody else was, but thank you for saving my life a number of times.

Billie Joe. Anyway, sentimentality time is over: \n\n1) Billie Joe: as I said earlier, you are my main inspiration for my guitar playing. What advice could you give to an aspiring guitarist?

I read in an interview with you that you'd taken bass lessons for RevRad. You're a pretty phenomenal bass player, responsible for some of the most recognizable bass riffs (She, Longview etc.) in rock history. What sort of stuff did these lessons entail?

Do you feel there's a certain \"holier-than-thou\" attitude within your fanbase (and within the punk scene in general)?  I've encountered (online) some unusually entitled fans who proclaim themselves to be more hardcore or \"better\" fans than others because they've been listening longer, etc., and at this point, I don't know what's going on anymore.\n\n-Has any fan behavior ever caused you to become concerned/disgusted/angry?\n\n-Might be a bit of a stupid question, but did you ever get to see the Ramones perform?  I remember hearing something a few months ago where Tom DeLonge said he had a chance to see their show, but missed it, and ended up regretting it.\n\n-What's the coolest story you've ever heard about your music (along the lines of \"Here Comes the Sun\" almost being included on the record sent up with the Voyager spacecraft, or AC/DC songs being blasted to keep up the morale of the captured American pilot in Mogadishu during the 'Black Hawk Down' ordeal)?\n\nAgain, thanks for taking the time to do this, and good luck with the tour!"], [1, "Hi, Green Day! \n\nYou were the first punk band that I really fell in love with.

I can't help but see a ton of negative comments about the whole  \"selling out\" nonsense. How has this affected your songwriting and you as individuals? My fear is one day being labeled something similar by my former \"Punk\" friends and I wanted some insight as to how you are able to deal with that. \n\n2.) With Bernie Sanders dropping out of the election (his hand was arguably forced but I'm still pretty sad) who do you think you will support? A Third Party candidate such as Johnson or Stein? \n\n3.) What is your practice regimen consist of? Any scales and modes? What do you like to jam on/learn in your spare time? \n\n4.) For all the guys: Did you have a definite \"I'm going to be a musician because of _______ moment?\" If so, What was it? \n\n5.) Do you like Streetlight Manifesto or Reel Big Fish? \n\n\n\nAgain, Your band played a big part in my musical journey. Thank you for doing what you do!

Yes or no?\n\nThird, I've been playing guitar for a long time, and I've been starting to learn to play drums recently (and have been filling in on them in my own band, as we have another guitar player, but haven't found a better drummer yet.)

Your music has really helped me through tough times, (particularly recently, when still breathing was released on one of the worst days I have ever had, and reminded me how glad I was that I am still breathing.) and continues to help me on a daily basis.

Billie Joe. Anyway, sentimentality time is over: \n\n1) Billie Joe: as I said earlier, you are my main inspiration for my guitar playing. What advice could you give to an aspiring guitarist? (And what's the best way to get a chance to get up on stage if I ever get the chance to see you guys live \ud83d\ude09) Oh, I've also been jonesing pretty bad for your signature Gibson ES-137. \n\n2) Tr\u00e9: You're well known for your incredibly energetic personality. What drives you? You're certainly one of the most lively performers I've ever seen. \n\n3) Mike: I've a friend who plays bass (probably the only one out here in the desert.) I read in an interview with you that you'd taken bass lessons for RevRad. You're a pretty phenomenal bass player, responsible for some of the most recognizable bass riffs (She, Longview etc.) in rock history. What sort of stuff did these lessons entail?

Do you feel there's a certain \"holier-than-thou\" attitude within your fanbase (and within the punk scene in general)?

In the final it's kinda duplicated so it sounds like hes saying it twice at once.\n\n* Vice versa for when he starts saying holocaust.\n\n* Also the final one has the crowd chanting in the background.\n\n* First one has a weird reverb effect at the very peak of that line.

Neither is inherently evil.\n\nThe problem arises when one ideology begins to dominate the other.

The black raven, the ideology of improving and innovating, which unfortunately affects both the minds of its people and the environment, killing the dove, which is the ideology of purity, emotion, and imagination. Shortly after one ideology is killed, you immediately see the world change and morph into the dark, cold and calculated ideology of science and society. \n\nThis concept of duality is further enforced in the image at 2:17. The dark cold ideology took over the world, yet the leader of the other ideology is white and pure. Furthermore, at 2:30 we see the effects of one ideology taking over. The world becomes darker. The cameras as watching to make sure you're only doing what you're supposed to. It suppresses free thinking. \n\nYou can see the mood and ideological shift at 2:50. The man sees the slaughter and has a look of shock; thinking to himself, \"holy shit. what we're doing is wrong.\" The friend who went down the path of society only snaps out of his cold calculated way of thinking when he kills his best friend.

But I don't feel strong emotions at all, just random lazy lines about being famous and having sex. His lyrics used to have more depth, even when they were thematically similar to these new songs.\n\nThen again, I'm being negative but the music was good, not what I expected but a nice surprise.

I'm sure everyone here has an artist whose music they love but has done some unsavory things in their personal life. I like The Beatles and John Lennon but Lennon was undeniably an asshole and beat his wife. For me, that takes nothing away from the quality of his music.

If you're referring songs like \"4, 5 seconds\" that he did with Rihanna, then I don't think that's a very fair point since it doesn't represent the amount of styles that Kanye covered in the past 5 or so years. [On Sight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnrLXDYnS6c) was the opener to his last album. Would you really consider that an example of an artist trying to broaden his appeal to fans of pop music? I certainly don't hear many things in that song that would appeal to pop fans, and the entire album has a very similar sound to that song. His most recent song released two days ago, [No More Parties In LA](https://soundcloud.com/kanyewest/nomorepartiesinla) doesn't exactly sound like it's trying to appeal to pop fans either. I can't think of many popular songs at the moment that consist of two people rapping for six minutes straight.

Back when there were limited airwaves, each genre could only get so much exposure. There wasn't as much room for niches or subgenres, and when a new sound really took over and became popular, everyone heard it, and other musicians had to take influence to stay relevant and maintain ground on the airwaves. \n\nUsing rock as a sample genre: In the sixties we had the rapid growth of rock, in the 70s we saw genres like punk and funk, which gave birth to new wave in the 80s, which gave birth to grunge in the 90s, but then the 2000s happened, and that's when things got weird.\n\nWith the internet, we have access to more music than ever. We don't follow large genres as they evolve, we break them down into smaller and smaller genres and find the exact niches that we like. If you like your rock with a little bit of electronics and sampling, there are about a thousand bands out there for you. If you want nothing but U2 cover bands, you'll find plenty out there. If you want to hear a mash-up of the Beatles and Jay Z, it exists.\n\nMusic today is absolutely awesome. There are great artists doing amazing things in all kinds of genres. Last year saw fantastic releases for jazz (The Epic), rock (Sound & Color), folk (Carrie & Lowell), hip hop (To Pimp a Butterfly), country (Traveler), pop (Emotion), electronic (In Colour), and more. But these albums don't result in sweeping cultural events when they come out, because we're all subdivided as listeners by our ability to access lots of music in precise genres. \n\nThe weird exception is pop: pop as a genre exists to be listened to by as many people as possible. Often, it achieves this by latching onto popular trends from other genres and appealing to the lowest common denominator, so it's rare for a pop album to have the effect of a classic in another genre.\n\nAnyone who says there's only crap music today, nothing new, is not actually a music fan. They're just a contrarian that has spent way too much time listening to their dad's music. It takes five seconds of googling to find awesome new music. "], [9, "No, this is actually a wonderful time in music.  You should not judge music as a human enterprise by what the commercial releases are.  Focus instead on the actual musical infrastructure instead.  Rather than just celebrities making music, the few chosen by the industry to fund, now EVERYONE can make music.  There have never been better tools and resources for producing music independently.  And more music is being made and recorded every year than you could possibly imagine.  It is exponentially expanding so that everyone has some mixtape to share.  As a musician, I cannot imagine a better universe to make music in.   Never have the means of musical production been so universal.  \n\nOf course, with so much music being made, it is harder to find the amazing gems that might interest you.  But again, on the consumer side, you have tools to listen to hoardes of music for a low cost.  \n\nStop complaining and make some fucking music you like.  This whining about missing the 70s/ 80s is a waste of time. \n\n"], [6, "There is too much music now for any one thing to captivate a large enough audience so as to be revolutionary."], [4, "only the good music from the past endures, so whenever you look at the past you only see good music. the good and bad music of the present has not yet been filtered. it's always like this."], [3, "You have to go find the music you want to hear unless you just like pop or classic rock (I listen to metal). Discovering a new band or just one I've never heard before that I instantly love is a great experience and then I get to share them with my friends."], [2, "I think the problem with music today is the industry.  Before the 90s I think the corporations making big money off music did it by finding great musicians and promoting them.  But this leaves too much to chance.  So now what they seem to do is just tell people what to like, and that is what \"mainstream\" is now.  \n\nHowever, there is still tons and tons of great music out there, you just have to find it.  It has really only gotten better, with more music and more access to music, musicians have more influence to draw on than ever before.  Its just what is great doesn't always get promoted, sometimes you have to actively look for it."], [3, "The main difference is the way we consume music and pop culture. I think that in the golden ages of music it was easier for a band to grab larger audiences because there were only so many ways for a band to get popular, think of it this way... If you were a band in the 70s or 80s you mainly reached your audiences by selling records, getting radio airplay or occasionally getting the odd televised performance or playing large venues. Sure, being in a group that revolutionizes a genre of music or breaks new ground helped your exposure and grew your fanbase. It was a lot easier back then to grab that attention because the average listener had little exposure to new music outside of what was being sold by the music media at the time. Even back then there were still underground scenes, and stuff being spread by word of mouth but the way music has evolved today is sort of different.\n\nToday, half of my favorite bands have never and will likely never see radio airplay, a music video or ever really make it big because we have changed the way we consume music. Today if I want to find some really cutting edge music I can put in some search terms in to spotify or youtube or any other service and probably find some new bands I've never heard of and I have near instant access to something new.   Contrast with \"back then\" where the situation was different... You wanted to hear the latest rock and roll group? Tune into the rock radio station or hit the record store, it was a much more limited selection of what you could discover and so you probably ended up liking things that were popular already.\n\nAnyone that thinks there is \"only crap\" is just too lazy or doesn't care enough about music to go find what they wanna hear. Its easy to think your favorite genre is dying or isnt as good if you haven't listened to all the new stuff on offer.\n\nI had an uncle who was pretty convinced that nobody listens to or makes rock records and more except for \"the old guys\". He had never taken the time to look up the latest stuff, as he came from an era where the magazines or radio would tell you what to listen to. I plugged in my MP3 player for him and put on The Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys and even stuff like QOTSA. Now he has spotify accounts and other services and is back listening to all the new stuff.\n\nTimes just changed man."], [3, "during the 80s people would ask the same question. now there is this nostalgia for all the great 80s music. 20 years from now people will be talking about all the great music that came out in 2016."], [2, "There was also a lot of crap in the 70s / 80s but fortunately we've had a few decades since to forget it and only remember the parts that are at least decent.\n\nI'd also imagine were in a kind of plateu currently, in the 70s and 80s-  even if not as much as in the 60s - there were still huge changes / improvements in ways to make and record music; but we've reached a point where only minor improvements are done (beyond just make it more accesible to anyone - but we're already past the big boom of computers / internet by now and accustomed to it - ) so it's harder to find new stuff to experiment with.\n\nThere's still lot of good music coming out, we just need to wait a while so we can look back with nostalgia tinted glasses to make the good stuff stand out from all the crap surrounding it.\n\n"], [2, "Music is like a tree. Prior to the internet and mass, user-created user-shared media, it was fairly linear.

But once the internet happened and people had instant access to any genre they wanted, at any point, and it became easy to share and create whatever you want.\n\nIf music's evolution was a tree, then up until now, we're been on the trunk. Suddenly it's branching out in every direction, and it's growing bigger, faster, every day. I think we're in the very beginning, the first decade or so, of a massive golden age of music, where every genre that's ever happened it being fleshed out, reinvented, reexplored, and reimagined a hundred times over every day. \n\nIt most definitely is revolutionary. Sure, mainstream pop music might not be as game-changing as genres in the past were, but you cant seriously tell me that Gorillaz, Cage the Elephant, even Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and Kanye havent revolutionized their genres.\n\nIgnoring them, which is who I assume you're talking about, there's a million bands out there with a billion tracks that are each new and unique.

Country music is better the farther back you go. There are a few odd exceptions here and there but I don't know a modern country artist whose album I would sit through. Most of the new music I listen to is rap or r&b. Maybe I don't spent enough time looking for music or I'm not involved enough in the right scenes but it does seem to me that 1950-1998 or so was a golden age for music and now is not (except maybe for rap).

Beyonce, Bieber, dubstep as a whole and all rock or country groups currently in their prime will be massively obscure.

If you want to hear a mash-up of the Beatles and Jay Z, it exists.\n\nMusic today is absolutely awesome. There are great artists doing amazing things in all kinds of genres. Last year saw fantastic releases for jazz (The Epic), rock (Sound & Color), folk (Carrie & Lowell), hip hop (To Pimp a Butterfly), country (Traveler), pop (Emotion), electronic (In Colour), and more. But these albums don't result in sweeping cultural events when they come out, because we're all subdivided as listeners by our ability to access lots of music in precise genres. \n\nThe weird exception is pop: pop as a genre exists to be listened to by as many people as possible. Often, it achieves this by latching onto popular trends from other genres and appealing to the lowest common denominator, so it's rare for a pop album to have the effect of a classic in another genre.\n\nAnyone who says there's only crap music today, nothing new, is not actually a music fan. They're just a contrarian that has spent way too much time listening to their dad's music. It takes five seconds of googling to find awesome new music.

It was to electronica what punk was to rock & roll\n\nWhat? How? Punk wasn't just music, it was a movement in art - visual, poetry, literature and music based on anti-establishment and DIY ideals. A lot of the label was later co-opted for mainstream marketing. Dubstep is just another facet of already underground EDM (not to mention that dubstep has been around longer than 10 years). Dubstep grew from a handful of existing, mostly underground electronic genres. Dubstep sought the mainstream. Punk was engulfed by the mainstream. Punk deconstructed rock and corporatization. There's still underground strains of both, but the two genres are not the same.\n\nAs big as boy bands? You are out of your mind. There have been and are multiple TV shows about real and fictional boy bands. Which TV shows exist about dubstep artists? Boy bands have existed since the 50s. As big as the money making juggernaut of hte late 90s-early 2000s boy bands? No, dubstep is not as big as boy bands.\n\nAs big as grunge? I hate the term \"gunge\" since it was just a label made by marketers. Grunge was a term applied to small group of artists from the Pacific Northwest and somehow spread to a lot of the alt/indie music scene of the 90s. The fact is, that grunge scene displaced rock and pop of an era. Gone were 80s hair bands. Pop acts were knocked down a peg. Who did dubstep displace? Dubstep flowed in as part of the whole EDM scene that became mainstream.\n\nI acknowledge dubstep is a thing and it's had its affects on EDM. Dubstep is more like auto-tune as a vocal effect except auto-tune in this facet was widely more pervasive.

Sure, being in a group that revolutionizes a genre of music or breaks new ground helped your exposure and grew your fanbase. It was a lot easier back then to grab that attention because the average listener had little exposure to new music outside of what was being sold by the music media at the time. Even back then there were still underground scenes, and stuff being spread by word of mouth but the way music has evolved today is sort of different.\n\nToday, half of my favorite bands have never and will likely never see radio airplay, a music video or ever really make it big because we have changed the way we consume music.

Country music is better the farther back you go. There are a few odd exceptions here and there but I don't know a modern country artist whose album I would sit through. Most of the new music I listen to is rap or r&b. Maybe I don't spent enough time looking for music or I'm not involved enough in the right scenes but it does seem to me that 1950-1998 or so was a golden age for music and now is not (except maybe for rap).

Beyonce, Bieber, dubstep as a whole and all rock or country groups currently in their prime will be massively obscure.

Run DMC, NWA and most old school will largely be forgotten and only used to teach about the origins of the genre. Rap is the best thing we have going.

In the 2015 VMA awards, [Taylor presented Kanye with his Video Vanguard Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7mLs9LeQB4). He accepted in as gracious a manner that Kanye could by rambling.\n\nFasttrack to Feb. 2016\n\nKanye West released an album named *[The Life of Pablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Pablo)*. The reason of its obscurity is because of the poor choice of streaming exclusively on [Tidal](http://tidal.com/), and its seemingly unfinished state (like his \"Imma fix wolves\" tweet, in reference to his other song that he reedited, or \"fixed,\" after releasing the album). Within T.L.o.P., it contains a song, \"[Famous](http://genius.com/8659237),\" in which he controversially raps \n> I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\n\n>Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)\n\n>I made that bitch famous x2\n\nTaylor then wins the 2016 Grammy's Best Album of the Year. In her award speech, she indirectly responds to Kanye by [saying](https://youtu.be/xPOPtQIEQt0?t=1m28s)\n> There are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success, or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame, but if you just focus on the work and you don\u2019t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you\u2019re going, you\u2019ll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there...\n\nBecause of her reaction, Swift is seen by the general public as a victim of Kanye's unfiltered and uncouth mouth. \n\nNOW\n\nThe reason why this is controversial, and the reason for #taylorisfake, is because Kanye has [claimed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/35561237/kanye-west-claims-he-had-taylor-swifts-blessing-for-lyrics-in-song-about-her) to have Taylor's \"blessing\" for the song and its lyrics. He claims in a deleted tweet that Swift heard the song before she appeared on the Grammys, and they have both discussed for an hour about the song.\n\nThe executive producer of the Grammys, Kenneth Ehrlich, also backs up Kanye on Swifts knowledge of the song.

They took the name 'Good Charlotte' from a children's book: Good Charlotte: The Girls Of Good Day Orphanage by Carol Beach York. They have released five albums, most notably 2002's multiplatinum seller The Young and the Hopeless, which spawned the chart topping singles, \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,\" \"The Anthem,\" and \"Girls & Boys.\" The band's third album is 2004's The Chronicles of Life and Death, the fourth, released 2007, is called \"Good Morning Revival\", and their fifth and most recent release was released in 2011, titled \"Cardiology\". The band is fronted by twin brothers Benji and Joel Madden, born in Waldorf, Maryland. Other members of the band include their friends Billy Martin and Paul Thomas.\n\n> Good Charlotte's frontmen, identical twins Joel and Benji Madden, were born on March 11, 1979 to a middle class family in Waldorf, Maryland. Their mother raised them with a strict, devout Catholic up-bringing. Their father left the family when the twins were 16 years old, causing financial problems for the twins, their mother, older brother, and younger sister. For a short period of time the twins had to work as shampoo boys in a salon. Benji and Joel cite their older brother Josh Madden for introducing them to rock music by bands such as The Beach Boys and Social Distortion. After attending a Beastie Boys concert at the age of 16, Benji and Joel decided to start their very own band, although Joel had never sung before, and Benji had never played guitar. The first band they started was called \"The Benji, Joel, and Brian Band,' which they started with a friend. The band was short lived. They then started Good Charlotte in 1996 when they recruited childhood friends Paul Thomas (bass) and Aaron Escolopio (drums). They soon moved to Annapolis, Maryland where they were introduced to Billy Martin by a friend\n\n> After releasing an EP, entitled Another EP, in 1999, Good Charlotte released their first self-titled album in 2000, which was not a huge commercial success. Singles that were released from that album include \"Little Things\" and \"Motivation Proclamation,\" and \"Festival Song\".\n\n> Aaron was the drummer in their debut album, Good Charlotte, before leaving the band in early 2001 to join the band Wakefield with his brother, Ryan. He was replaced with Dusty, who was just a temporary drummer, who had left the band before the recording of their second album, The Young & the Hopeless. As a result, veteran professional studio drummer Josh Freese plays for that album.\n\n> 2002's The Young And The Hopeless was much more popular and marked the bands emergence into mainstream music. The single that made them famous, titled \"Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous\", topped charts around the globe. Singles that followed from that album included \"The Anthem\" ,\"Girls & Boys\", \"Hold On\" and \"The Young and The Hopeless\". \"The Young and the Hopeless\" received a 3x-platinum certification from the RIAA, landing the band on Saturday Night Live, the covers of Rolling Stone and Alternative Press, a two page feature in the New York Times, and spots on CNN and The Today Show. Good Charlotte were also hugely popular on MTV, where the Madden Brothers once served as hosts on the late night music video show \"All Things Rock.\" Their music videos were favorites on both MTV and MTV2, with \"The Anthem\" going on to receive the \"Viewers Choice Award\" on MTV's 2003 Video Music Awards.\n\n> Chris Wilson was the band's drummer for their third album, The Chronicles of Life and Death, which was released in 2004 in two formats, one for \"life\" and one for \"death\". There were two differences between the two versions: The CD Covers represented either \"Life\" or \"Death\", and the CDs contained a different bonus track depending on which version was bought. Both versions had the same hidden track (however, on iTunes, the hidden track is listed as track 16). The singles released from that album include \"Predictable\", \"I Just Wanna Live\", \"We Believe\" and \"The Chronicles of Life and Death\". This album was considered a departure from their previous 2 albums. In May 2005, Chris left the band for personal health reasons, citing a fall out with the Madden brothers and taking them to court later in the year. Then, Benji told Kerrang! magazine that Chris leaving the band was the worst part of 2005 for him. Talk about trying to keep up appearances.\n\n> Their most recent \"Noise to the World\" tour with Simple Plan featured Dean Butterworth, who has previously played with Morrissey, who has now been offically endorsed as a full paid member of GC.\n\n> Their Fourth Studio Album: \"Good Morning Revival\" was released March 2007, and the first single \"Keep Your Hands Off My Girl\" is available to listen to and watch on their myspace page. They have also produced the video for the song titled \"The River\" which features Synyster Gates (lead guitarist and backing vocalist for Avenged Sevenfold) and M. Shadows (lead vocalist for Avenged Sevenfold).\n\n> Although fans and press argue whether the band is 'punk', the band themselves say that they are a rock band. In 2008 Billy said 'We make music, its what we love. Enjoy music for music's sake'. Billy has always shown his distaste for being considered to be in a punk band, 'I have never listened or been a fan of punk, I'm a metal head through and through'.\n\n> Their song \"The Click\" was used as the title track for an animated series called \"Undergrads\".

Like David Bowie or Radiohead, Kanye kept amazing me how often he tackled a new genre or style and did it so well. \n\n\nBut then Watch the Throne happened, and Kanye fell into this creative style where all he did was \"yell\" and started rapping about getting laid and all his money (he did that on past albums, but there was more charm to it and it wasn't as frequent). \n\n\nEven Yeezus which people seem to praise. That album had his worst lyrics by far. And while Kanye has never been the best lyricist, I've always thought he was smart and charming. Because Yeezus was such a stripped down album on the production side, it put more emphasis on his lyrics. Then you read interviews where Rick Rubin said Kanye was writing and recording lyrics a day before the album was turned in. That he came in and stripped the entire album and they started over and finished the record in 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n I like elements of Yeezus, and as someone that is a fan of punk and Infustrial Rock, I get the appeal of the album being Raw and brash. But I still feel the album felt undercooked/rushed and the lyrics were awful. And then you see those interviews and it makes sense. They took a close to complete album and stripped it. They started from scratch and finished in 2 weeks. Kanye didn't even have lyrics written or performed for several songs and didn't finish until the day before.\n\n\nCompare that to his previous efforts. Every release prior to Watch the Throne, was very well thought out. It was worked and worked until Kanye thought it was just right. The production and writing had much more depth (again, not against Yeezus stripped down style,  but even that style could have been worked more and fleshed out more).\n\n\nLastly, the same way a lot of fans became annoyed by recent era Eminem because he had that \"angry yell voice/inflection\"...I feel like Kanyes delivery has also been in a similar slump. I still find it baffling how much people love \"All Day\". Then you consider this is the same artist that put out \"Runaway\"?!? \n\n\nTo wrap this up, I think this sounds great.

And I've loved every single album he did up to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Like David Bowie or Radiohead, Kanye kept amazing me how often he tackled a new genre or style and did it so well. \n\n\nBut then Watch the Throne happened, and Kanye fell into this creative style where all he did was \"yell\" and started rapping about getting laid and all his money (he did that on past albums, but there was more charm to it and it wasn't as frequent). \n\n\nEven Yeezus which people seem to praise. That album had his worst lyrics by far. And while Kanye has never been the best lyricist, I've always thought he was smart and charming. Because Yeezus was such a stripped down album on the production side, it put more emphasis on his lyrics. Then you read interviews where Rick Rubin said Kanye was writing and recording lyrics a day before the album was turned in. That he came in and stripped the entire album and they started over and finished the record in 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n I like elements of Yeezus, and as someone that is a fan of punk and Infustrial Rock, I get the appeal of the album being Raw and brash. But I still feel the album felt undercooked/rushed and the lyrics were awful. And then you see those interviews and it makes sense. They took a close to complete album and stripped it. They started from scratch and finished in 2 weeks. Kanye didn't even have lyrics written or performed for several songs and didn't finish until the day before.\n\n\nCompare that to his previous efforts. Every release prior to Watch the Throne, was very well thought out. It was worked and worked until Kanye thought it was just right. The production and writing had much more depth (again, not against Yeezus stripped down style,  but even that style could have been worked more and fleshed out more).\n\n\nLastly, the same way a lot of fans became annoyed by recent era Eminem because he had that \"angry yell voice/inflection\"...I feel like Kanyes delivery has also been in a similar slump. I still find it baffling how much people love \"All Day\". Then you consider this is the same artist that put out \"Runaway\"?!? \n\n\nTo wrap this up, I think this sounds great. First song in a while that sounds like the Kanye I grew up loving. I don't need him to stay on the same style, but I'm at least glad he went back to this vocal delivery.", "id": "cz2tno4"}, {"comment": "A few scattered things:\n\n- I never understood why *Yeezus* is considered a minimalist project. On the heels of the super-complex *MBDTF*, I guess I could see that, but there's still very layered production on that album.\n\n- Also, Kanye said he only recorded vocals in that last two weeks, and that he had been working on the lyrics for months.\n\nBut I don't think it makes sense to consider *Yeezus* to anything else he's ever done. Comparing that album to *MBDTF* is like comparing Wire to Pink Floyd. It's an intentionally abrasive album that flirts with punk and noise and house, which was a huge departure for rap in general.\n\nThe general audience has backed off *Yeezus*, but I still think it's like an 8.5/10 project.", "id": "cz2vb16"}, {"comment": "I've always thought of Kanye a fan of Progressive Rock since some of his samples are from Prog Bands.
