Again, on itself it is not that impressive, 100s of botnets do this. But i still find Stuxnet one of the prime example of Cyber warfare. It hid itself by thinking of every little detail. Any tool that could be used to detect file changes, was infiltrated and deliberately altered in such a way that whenever it checked a file that Stuxnet infected, it would return a valid ok reply instead of an error. \\n\\nAfter infecting thousands of systems, it finally made it into the centrifuge control system (which was not connected to internet, btw) in Iran which used that specific version of centrifuges they wanted to destroy and did its thing (again fooling/avoiding any control mechanism which verified file/memory/... structure by injecting specific hacks in each control mechanism) and destroyed the centrifuges by just alternating the speed of the centrifuges by a tiny amount.\\n\\nEventually of course, it got caught and a lot of research has been done on Stuxnet. Showing us what a set of genius hackers can accomplish. \\n\\nIt is scary, it is dangerous, it should serve as a warning for anybody thinking IT security is ahead of the game. It is not, far from it. If it comes down to it, your systems are unsafe and open to whomever really want access. You are just lucky nobody, except for some simple criminals who are looking for some simple money or basic chaos, are really interested in your systems or information.\\n\\nThere are several white papers about Stuxnet (for instance [the Symantec one](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf) ), and they are worth the read if you want to be amazed by what hackers can create.\"],\n",

Not the regular place where files/folders are kept, but the internal storage of the device that tells your hard drive how to function and interact with the rest of your computer.

The company I work for rents out rooms and equipment that independent contractors use in several different properties all in the south east of the UK. Sorry but I won't get more specific than that, I have a VERY sweet gig here, earn a great living essentially having fun at my PC. We have no work network or anything like that in my office and the network and system access is not closed and we have full access to the internet. I also double as the head of IT for my office as pretty much everyone else I work with is over the age of 50 and IT illiterate. The extent of me fixing any computers in my office boils down to me turning things off and on again or installing virus scanner software\\u2019s and they think I am a genius for doing it. \\n\\nWhat the program does: Basically, it reads my emails for me. Well, it finds certain key words and figures, automatically enters them into a spreadsheet, which then automatically updates a 'diary' I have of all the contractors, when they work, how much they are working, what they are renting from us ETC. It then works out what to invoice them, and what they have to pay us, and automatically formulates a response working out all the tax/rent/bills they need to pay and gives me a number in what I need to pay them. Someone in the comments actually guessed pretty much exactly how my program works and summed it up pretty well once he know basically what my job is, and I strongly suspect that he has managed to automate a large portion of his job as well. I use autohotkey, which I run through Citrix using my own OCR. \\n\\nYes I have back-ups! 4 at least! I haven't actually 'done' my job in several years; if the program got lost or corrupted I would probably have to re learn my job (which is admittedly not all that complicated, just very dull and time consuming). Also, to access the program, it doesn't pop up on my screen and ask me for a password. If I did that and someone had to use my computer when I was sick or on holiday and something jumped up asking for a password, which would raise several difficult to answer questions. \\n\\nAs for the people saying 'why don't you sell the program', is because I am positive that much larger companies already use programs like mine and have been doing so for years. If I offered to sell it to the guy who owns my company, he would realise that programs like mine exist, he could probably pay some student to whip up something very similar over a weekend and pay him cash in hand, then lay off half the people I work with. These people are my friends and I am in a management position now so I am the boss for most of them. I won't let my laziness cost them their job. \\n\\nAs for what I do with my day... well, it's pretty sweet. I make very good money with that I 'do'. I am able to support my family, pay bills and go on nice holidays a few times a year. I have a good pension with private healthcare. While when I get to work I play computer games, watch everything and anything on netflix, brows reddit and gaming forums etc. I watched Jessica Jones when it was relased on Netflix in a day and a half at work. I have spent most of my day today playing fallout 4. (I paid for the graphics card myself; I am not stupid enough to put that on the companies invoice).\\n\\n\"],\n",

       "  u'The Stuxnet exploit was impressive. A bit of background for those who don\\'t know:\\n\\nMost automated process and manufacturing systems are controlled by PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers). PLCs were invented in the late 1960\\'s for GM in order to facilitate model year changeovers more quickly. Before that, every automated circuit had to be physically wired to physical timers, relays, counters, and various other components. In order to make adjustments, the electrical panels would have to be re-wired. The PLC was revolutionary in that it was an industrial grade controller with I/O that could be programmed by people who weren\\'t programmers. From the first Modicon 084, an industry was created. Today, just about every piece of automated equipment is controlled by a PLC. It goes beyond just manufacturing into amusement parks (PLCs also control roller coasters), petrochemical, oil and gas, and even power generation. And power generation is where our story begins.\\n\\nBut first, we need to back up and talk about code. Most people, when they think about computer code, it\\'s something like this:\\n\\n    IF Something_Happens = 1 THEN\\n        DO_THIS = 1\\n    ELSE\\n        DO_OTHER_THING = 1\\n\\nPLC code is completely different. It looks more like this:\\n\\n           Something_Happens                        DO_THIS\\n    |-------------| |--------------------------------(   )-----|\\n    |      Something_Happens                     DO_OTHER THING|\\n    |-------------|/|--------------------------------(   )-----|\\n\\nSome of you might see the PLC code and it looks familiar. That PLC code is what\\'s known as \"ladder logic.\" It\\'s a graphical programming language where you build \"virtual circuits\" and you can change how the machine is controlled with a simple programming edit. Why use ladder logic in lieu of a more traditional language like BASIC? The reason is twofold. First, BASIC didn\\'t become common on computers until the mid-70s, so when the PLC first went online, computer programming was much more difficult. Second, the people who were programming the PLCs were used to looking at electrical schematics, so the bottom example made more sense to them than the top. As a result, GM didn\\'t have to train their electricians to be able to write computer code, since they were already familiar with ladder diagrams.\\n\\nLadder logic caught on and became the defacto standard PLC programming language. At first, security was not much of a concern. PLCs could be networked, but it was usually proprietary or the type of communication protocol that only PLCs used (Modbus being the most popular). But in the late 90\\'s, Ethernet began to take off, meaning PLCs could be hooked up to the entire plant network, making large, distributed systems possible. Two industrial Ethernet protocols arose: Ethernet/IP and Profinet. Profinet is most common in Europe and IIRC is backed by Siemens. Ethernet/IP is an ODVA standard is most common on American PLCs (Allen-Bradley being the most common). Ethernet/IP (the IP stands for \"Industrial Protocol,\" it\\'s NOT the same as TCP/IP) can work with any standard ethernet switch. Profinet requires special switches and network hardware. This is one reason that made Stuxnet so amazing.\\n\\nWhat is Stuxnet? Stuxnet was a worm that infiltrated Iranian nuclear power facilities. It implanted code that caused the centrifuges to spin at dangerous levels and ruin themselves, greatly sabotaging Iranian efforts to get nuclear power (or weapons, if you believe the hype). How it works is that it gets loaded on the \"patient zero\" PC and distributes itself throughout the network. It continuously scans for an installation of Siemens Step7 software (which is the programming software for Siemens S7 PLCs). If it finds it, it modifies the code of the software to install a rootkit on the PLC the next time the PC or laptop is connected to it.  The rootkit sends erronous commands to the ouputs, but it also (and this is the genius part) *covers its tracks* so when the programmer monitors the program live, it *looks* like everything is working correctly, even if it isn\\'t. For example, the PLC might be telling a motor to spin at 30 Hz. Stuxnet infects it, and sends out a command to the motor to spin at 90 Hz. But if you\\'re monitoring it with the Siemens software, it *tells you* the drive is spinning at 30 Hz, even though it isn\\'t. This is the first documented case of a PLC system being infiltrated from the internet and infected with a virus. The vast majority of computer hackers wouldn\\'t even know what to do with a PLC if they encountered one. The code and hardware architecture is so alien to most people in the IT and hacker realm, and only very specialized people with specific knowledge of how PLC systems work can do anything with it.\\n\\nBottom-line, Stuxnet required *very* intelligent people with a *very* specific knowledge set to pull off. I\\'m talking intelligence and knowledge that makes Anonymous look like your grandma trying to use a computer. The alarming thing is, they broke through on Profinet, which requires specialized hardware. The same thing could probably be done more easily on Ethernet/IP, which is  compatible with hardware you can get at Best Buy (though not recommended and any integrator worth his salt will use industrial-rated networking components). The most prevalent rumor is that this was an attack orchestrated by the US and Israeli governments. I think that\\'s pretty likely, considering the target and the amount of specific knowledge required.\\n\\nBut the point is, PLCs are one of those things that we have relied on for years without even realizing it. Almost everything you buy was made in part by automated equipment run by PLCs. They\\'re responsible for keeping power plants, water plants, oil refineries, sewage treatment plants, and a number of other points of infrastructure we take for granted running. Stuxnet was an emperor\\'s new clothes moment, because if a secure nuclear facility could be ruined by a virus, so could an oil refinery, or a water treatment plant. Most people don\\'t realize how utterly scary the implications of Stuxnet are. It was, essentially, the Hiroshima moment in the automation world.'],\n",

       "  u'I guess \"Hackers\" is kind of a broad term to use. We can get super technical with the stuff guys can do from home or we can get just plain clever using regular methods. \\n\\nCredit Card theft is interesting. You\\'ve probably heard of skimmers at ATMs and gas stations but those are the obvious ones who\\'ll get caught. Instead, writing your own keylogger that transmits info to a free cloud server and then running around from hotel to hotel and installing it as a startup service on the free lobby computers isn\\'t all that difficult (Your 14 year old can google how to do this).\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got someone\\'s banking or credit card info they used on those PCs to check their balance while travelling - you use that to ship items to an anonymously registered PO box that you can check, or even just to a nearby neighbours house with a false name on it if you\\'re willing to watch for the mailman. Sell the goods, keep em, whatever, you\\'ve just stolen some cash from a hotel visitor without any Anti-virus or firewall software in the world stopping you because you\\'re not prolifically spreading your software like a traditional virus. You could use someone\\'s credit card to buy some cloud servers and use them to mine bitcoin, but I have a feeling this isn\\'t as secure as people think, and that there might be ways to trace that back to you. \\n\\nTechnical side of things - we\\'re still dealing with the same old problems. Browser plugins are on their way out as most browsers are starting to disable them as other tech picks up the slack (with html5 for video there\\'s no need for flash, etc) - but embedding scripts into video files, people are always sharing tv shows these days, images, downloading porn... even adverts that get loaded on Legitamit pages like Reddit are methods of mass exposure. If you find a browser exploit, and there\\'s always someone out there who knows something, then exploiting it through one of the above methods is most likely possible - where you can then get access to the appData folder for your browser they can put some nasty shit in your browsers startup that can basically do whatever they want, as long as they\\'ve coded it in before hand. \\n\\nThis might even be opening up remote access from abroad, and sending your public IP back to another server so they\\'ll know when you log onto the net and when they can listen in on what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nLike, all this stuff is possible, but the reality is that there\\'s far too few hackers of this level to monitor everyone, so the odds that a hacker has chosen you is minimal. There\\'s also the matter of getting caught; it\\'s one thing to be able to DO all this stuff, but there\\'s a decent amount of Risk it can come back on you, so you have to make sure what you\\'re getting out of it is worth the risk. Stealing credit card info to order a pizza now and then could mean years in Jail for a bit of food. \\n\\nThe trick isn\\'t to do something crazy, the methods are there.

By getting them to spin too fast or too slow, and closing safety valves, the attackers could do anything they wanted to the centrifuges... from making them appear to work poorly and inefficiently, to causing them to spin out of control and topple into their neighboring centrifuges (think of all of these [6 foot tall metal things](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2008-Iran-centrifuges-Natanz.jpg) whirling at 80,000 RPMS internally, getting unbalanced and whipping violently into their neighbors).\\n\\nAnother scary fact mentioned in this book -\\n\\nOccasionally hackers discover 0-day vulnerabilities, meaning new exploits that have never been seen or at least never been patched before. That\\'s nothing new. These vulnerabilities are virtually guaranteed to work for a while, until someone rushes to put out a fix. They\\'re rare, so attackers usually save these for something special.\\n\\nHowever Stuxnet used 4 of these exploits in a single attack. And apparently there\\'s plenty more where that came from. These exploits are sold openly, it\\'s not even technically illegal (except for americans to sell them to enemies of the state). And our own government is one of the buyers. You\\'d think they\\'d have an obligation to inform software companies of unpatches vulnerabilities, but instead we stockpile a collection of these so that we can use them for anonymous cyberwarfare. Read the book if this is sounding a bit \"conspiracy nut\". It\\'s documented and openly admitted.

Look up the wired (i think) story.\\n* Many IoT items such as coffee makers and fridges have been shown to allow access to the network they are on from the outside.\\n* If an attacker has physical access to a computer (without an encrypted HD) it is fairly easy to gain access. \\n* Many routers are not updated and exploitable.\\n* Many people will give up access if you ask the right questions (social engineering).\\n* Any my personal favorite. If you have wifi turned on, on your phone or device. An attacker can easily make you phone connect to a rogue wifi Access point and then capture all your data. Wifi Pineapple for the win.'],\n",

       "  u'When I took hacking up as a hobby a few years back. I focused solely on personal computer hacking. I wasn\\'t interested in hacking websites or databases.\\n\\nBut there is literally a black market online, where people can buy FUD RAT\\'s for like $30 to infect other computers and give the hackers access to your computer. \\n\\n**FUD** - Fully undetectable, this cannot be picked up my anti-virus or anti-malware because it is brand new and the programs don\\'t know what to look for. \\n\\n**UD** - Somewhat detectable by a few\\n\\n**D** - Detectable, virus is now 100% worthless. \\n\\n**RAT** - Remote Administration Tool.\\n\\nBecause the virus would be a .exe program, there was another program you\\'d use to completely overwrite that, and hide it inside a broken .jpeg file with a custom error message. \\n\\nUsers would click the .jpeg file, it would open Windows Image Viewer and say the file was corrupt but the virus has now installed itself on your system and even added itself to the startup. \\n\\nCelebrus was one RAT that was often used, this was very very powerful tool. Once infected everything was just a click of a button away. You could:\\n\\n* Grab all their username/passwords and send it to your FTP\\n* Turn on their webcam\\n* Browse and download their files\\n* Watch their desktop\\n* Open their DVD drive\\n* Change all their settings\\n\\nAll this could be done without the person even knowing about it, even while directly using the computer. \\n\\nPro Tip: When your browser says, \"Do you want to save this username/password?\" **Always click NO**. Saved passwords is how the virus\\' gets them. \\n\\nEdit: I learned how to hack, because I wanted to know how to stop it. Seeing how it was done gave me the ability to write articles on how to protect yourself on my blog I had back then. It\\'s been many years since I\\'ve been a part of this, so things could have changed drastically by now. But still, be smart out there. Don\\'t just click on anything. '],\n",

       "  u\"The best hackers could probably kill you by the magic of hacking.\\n\\nLet me run this scenario by you.\\n\\nYour local hospital has an IT department of, oh, maybe 3 guys. These guys know the son of the former hospital director and have been around for 5-15 years, and they are not up to date on the latest security issues. They mostly drink coffee, browse reddit and play darts using xray images of various patients for targets, trying to nail the cancer.\\n\\nThere's 800 employees at the hospital, and they have a lot of systems; there's various onsite and offsite servers, but the majority of the heavy lifting is done by external contractors.\\n\\nThese contractors are typically hired based on past jobs completed, but hospitals are so low risk that they likely don't care much about security certificates, and so no background checks have been completed on the employees working for the contractors.\\n\\nThis might sound super complicated, but basically, it's like this: The hospital has a number of software needs. All of these needs are tended to with software developed elsewhere. This stuff is relatively safe. The software may run on hardware the hospital owns. The hardware sits inside the hospital, and is safe from all but a few people with security access. Some of the software may also run on external hardware, off site. This is increasingly common. All of the software needs people running it. Some of the software can be run by hospital staff, but a significant part of it is maintained by external contractors. This is our hacktivists attack vector.\\n\\nYou see, a small external contractor likes to make money - and so they have interns. Our hacktivists offer to intern for such a contractor. Internship lasts 3 months, but a capable intern will absolutely start working for the customers of the contractor. Eventually, he has to update the task management system for the hospital. For this, he needs root access.\\n\\nThis is the point where everything turns ugly - the hacker can include a security hole in the update he applies to the software. Now he has a hole into the task management system of the hospital, and so he can forge tasks between people who rarely speak to each other. At this point, he can spoof two tasks. One is a task created by a physician on vacation concerning a prominent patient. They qualify for a testing program, or they are overdue for a test, or what have you, and they are to be booked for an appointment at a certain date with a certain doctor. Prior to the appointment, they need an xray, and so a task is generated for the x-ray operators to schedule an xray scan.\\n\\nA task from an employee concerning a technical glitch on one of the xray machines is simultaneously created. Model number, make, everything is included. Xray machines are highly complex, but technicians can obviously update them. As part of the task, which is given to maintenance, they must call a number so that the technician may make an arrangement to gain entry to the hospital and access the xray machines out-of-hours.\\n\\nOur hacker will need to show up, modify the code running on the machine, such that at a specific time, the machine is going to use too many xrays. This means he needs a copy of the firmware running on that x-ray machine, but considering he will be at the hospital, as a technician, with full access to the x-ray machine in question, this will be realtively simple.\\n\\nOnce the patient goes for his xray, he will receive a lethal dose - and he will be dead within 3 weeks. The police won't even be notified as he will simply die from a sickness the hospital isn't able to identify.\\n\\nHacking. It's delicious, lethal magic.\"],\n",

       "  u'Somewhere, probably in Maryland, a pasty white guy^1 not unlike you went to work this morning as he has gone to work every morning for the last decade or so.  He walked into his office, sat down at his computer, and began systematically probing the inner workings of a piece of software looking for vulnerabilities.  \\n\\nHe is among the best hackers in the world.\\n\\nHe takes notes as he works.  Each attack vector is cataloged, documented, and indexed by his employer.  Though the international community hasn\\'t really caught up yet, his employer treats each of these vulnerabilities like a weapon.  They are guarded in much the same way as other critical national secrets and stockpiled for strategic use should war ever come.\\n\\nAnd they have been used before.\\n\\nIn the Spring of 2010 the United States and Israel were both deeply concerned about the progress that Iran was making towards an atomic bomb.  Uranium centrifuge cascades spun in long chains in secret and heavily fortified locations deep inside Iran.  Cut off from the internet -- \"air-gapped,\" as is the parlance -- these systems were beyond the reach of both network and air-borne attack.\\n\\nSo the United States and Israel collaborated to create a purpose-built cyber-weapon.  It used some of these stockpiled vulnerabilities -- so called \"0-Days\" -- to spread through a MS Windows environment and infect the Siemens industrial control systems which regulated the centrifuge process.  Loaded onto USB sticks and other portable storage devices, the weapon needed only for a single unwitting accomplice to transport it beyond the air-gap to do its work.  \\n\\nOnce inside the secure network the weapon - a worm, more accurately - sought out and targeted the specific logic controllers which governed the speed at which the Iranian centrifuges spun.  It altered the rate at which they spun while simultaneously reporting back false data about that rate in order to cover its own tracks.  Doing this required intimate knowledge not only of the network security in use, but also operational details of the targeted controllers and how to exploit them.  \\n\\nNeither Microsoft nor Siemens knew of the vulnerabilities in their systems but that pasty white guy from Maryland and his co-workers figured them out.  Armed with that knowledge, they managed to destroy 20% of Iran\\'s uranium enrichment capability in the spring of 2010 with a USB drive.  \\n\\nSo what can the best computer hackers in the world do?  The can take a massive industrial plant that\\'s guarded round-the-clock and not even connected to the internet and they can bring it down, from half a world away right under the noses of the very people who are charged with safeguarding it.\\n\\nAnd if they can do that, they can do similar things to the power grid, to municipal water supplies, air traffic control, etc.  \\n\\nThe best hackers in the world have, at their fingertips, the capacity to teach the rest of us why informational weapons ought to be considered a Weapon of Mass Destruction.  It is only a matter of time before they do.\\n\\nEdited to include details of transmission.\\n\\n1. No judgements intended here; I\\'m just playing the odds.'],\n",
