Let's look at how they *could* help in this fight:\n\nThe *primary* lens which we must view ISIL with is religious, not political.  For example, our propaganda must concentrate on spiritual and not secular arguments; mullahs in Saudi and elsewhere *must proclaim loudly and unequivocally that ISIL followers will burn in hell eternally*.  Note that simply saying that followers are wrong headed or misguided doesn't cut it.  I know that it seems odd to western secular ears, but this must be an argument about their eternal soul.

As much as we hate what they do, they are managing a society that has no concept of collective action at the largest levels: they are tribal, and that's the core problem. Tribal people cannot rule themselves as a nation without a whip or the threat of supernatural retaliation, which explains the tendency to be ruled by  dictators or religious maniacs.\n\nClarification: I am not saying they are genetically incapable of post enlightenment style democracy, I am saying that is not their historical grounding.

To make the claim that the \"Suppression of Free Speech in Academia Is Out of Control\" implies the university is doing the suppression -but curiously, it is the *students* and it isn't necessarily suppression.\n\n>The next evening \u2014 at a William F. Buckley, Jr. Program conference on free speech that had been planned months in advance \u2014 Greg Lukianoff\u2019s speech was interrupted by a student who rushed the podium, shouting, before he was dragged out of the building by campus police.\n\nSo whose speech was suppressed? The speaker at the podium or the student dragged out? It may sound strange, but in truth neither of them had their speech suppressed.\n\nThe man at the podium got to speak after the student was removed so his speech wasnt suppressed -merely forestalled. And the student is, I am certain, still saying all those same things they burst in to shout so their speech isn't suppressed either.\n\nSomeone brought this to my attention recently when they demanded that their right to free speech is inviolable and they'd never stand for suppression in any circumstance. Well, it just isn't true. [Go to a White House event and shout at the President](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwbmd5CkxH0) and discover how quickly you are ejected. He won't hand you a mic, no camera will cut to you, no one there will care about anything except your speedy removal from the room. And guess what -your free speech wasn't suppressed.\n\nWhat these students are doing is wrong, I cannot quibble about that nor will I try. Even if their intentions are good, this is not the way you accomplish it. But this and many articles like it aren't terribly much better when they try and mislead you on what the suppression of free speech is. No one, not the president, not a guest speaker at a university, is obligated in any way to let you speak -on any topic. In fact, no live speaker need be there at all. When the new Star Wars movie comes out, go stand in front of the screen and make a speech about your favorite cause. Let us know how loudly the sound of your shoes scraping across the floor is as you get dragged out. You just are not entitled to speak there. Sorry. And you still have the right to free speech.\n\nWhen a law is passed or a rule engaged that tells the citizenry they will be punished in some way for using specific words, or speaking out on certain topics, or daring to speak ill of the president, prime minister, emperor or king, then you have had your free speech suppressed.\n\nHere's an example of the suppression of free speech in America.\n\n[Florida Orders Mental Exam for Worker Who Pushed Climate Change Agenda](http://gawker.com/florida-orders-mental-exam-for-worker-who-pushed-climat-1692360435)\n\n[First Florida, Now Wisconsin, Bans the Words \u2018Climate Change\u2019](http://ecowatch.com/2015/04/09/florida-wisconsin-ban-words-climate-change/)\n\nIf the university had told their guest speaker that a certain topic must not be mentioned, even in name only, or he'd face some sort of serious punishment then they did indeed suppress free speech. A student rushing in shouting is not a suppression of free speech, it is a rude interruption and an inappropriate venue for the speech they are clearly still legally free to employ elsewhere. Neither was the student's free speech trampled upon for being ejected from an event they disrupted.\n\nWhat seems to be going on campuses is alarming and I fear this crop of students have missed the educational boat entirely but unless the readers of this article have as well, they know very well this is hyperbolic nonsense.

Here's some examples, even though I thought I spelled it out very clearly already.\n\n1) You walk into a crowded restaurant, stand up on the table and express your opinion of politics.

Loehmann and his partner, Officer Frank Garmback, were responding to a call about a man with a gun. They pulled up in front of Tamir seconds before Loehmann stepped out of the police car and opened fire.\n\nThe officers said Tamir appeared to be reaching into his waistband for a gun in the moments leading up to his being shot. In fact, the weapon was a toy.\n\n\u201cThe Rice family is disturbed by the city\u2019s behavior,\u201d Subodh Chandra, a lawyer for the family, wrote in an email to The Washington Post about the creditor\u2019s claim. \u201cThe callousness, insensitivity, and poor judgment required for the city to send a bill \u2014 its own police officers having slain 12-year-old Tamir \u2014 is breathtaking.\u201d\n\nHe said the act \u201cadded insult to homicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is obviously a deliberate, considered action by the city of Cleveland; it required a formal court filing,\u201d he said.\n\nA grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the officers last December prompted protesters to call for a federal investigation into the shooting and for the resignation of Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J.

Such is the case with federal records laws such as the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act, which govern the conduct of federal employees and officials, even that of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n>What\u2019s more, the civil sanctions provided in **these laws can be applied only to people who still remain federal employees at the time** at which their violation is discovered and acted upon. \n\nhttp://lawnewz.com/politics/hillary-clinton-absolutely-violated-the-federal-records-act-heres-why-she-cant-be-punished/\n\nI don't seem to have access to the comment I was referring to so I can address your concern of context.  \n\nClearly, the entire post is about Johnson being ignorant of basic information.  So, I don't see how commenting on that could need more explanation.\n\nI also find it hard to believe that the attack on Trump needs explanation. But if you need some, try any of the Republican newspapers that have recently come out against Trump as being unfit:\n\n>Paper: **New Hampshire Union Leader**\n\n>History: Backed Every Republican presidential candidate since 1916\n\n>Headline: \"A better choice for President (No need to hold your nose)\"\n\n>Choice quote: \"**[Trump] is a liar, a bully, a buffoon.** He denigrates any individual or group that displeases him. He has dishonored military veterans and their families, made fun of the physically frail, and changed political views almost as often as he has changed wives.\"\n\n>Paper: **Arizona Republic**\n\n>History: Backed every Republican presidential candidate since its founding in 1890\n\n>Headline: \"Hillary Clinton is the only choice to move America ahead\"\n\n>Choice quote: \"The 2016 Republican candidate is **not conservative and he is not qualified** .... Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads .... Trump's inability to control himself ... represents a real **threat to our national security** .... Trump's long history of objectifying women and his demeaning comments about women during the campaign are not just good-old-boy gaffes. They are evidence of **deep character flaws**. They are part of a pattern .... Taken together they reveal a candidate who doesn\u2019t grasp our national ideals .... Instead of offering solutions, he hangs scapegoats like pi\u00f1atas and invites people to take a swing.\"\n\n>Paper: **The Dallas Morning News**\n\n>History: Backed every Republican presidential candidate since 1940\n\n>Headline: \"We recommend Hillary Clinton for president\"\n\n>Choice quote: \"Trump's values are hostile to conservatism. He plays on fear \u2014 exploiting base instincts of **xenophobia, racism and misogyny** \u2014 to bring out the worst in all of us, rather than the best. His serial shifts on fundamental issues reveal an **astounding absence of preparedness**. And his improvisational insults and midnight tweets exhibit a **dangerous lack of judgment and impulse control.**\"\n\n>Paper: **Cincinnati Enquirer**\n\n>History: Backed every Republican presidential candidate since 1916\n\n>Headline: \"It has to be Hillary Clinton\"\n\n>Choice quote: \"**Trump is a clear and present danger to our country** .... His wild threats to blow Iranian ships out of the water if they make rude gestures at U.S. ships is just the type of reckless, cowboy diplomacy Americans should fear from a Trump presidency .... Do we really want someone in charge of our military and nuclear codes who has an impulse control problem? .... Trump brands himself as an outsider untainted by special interests, but we see a man **utterly corrupted by self-interest.** His narcissistic bid for the presidency is more about making himself great than America .... Why should anyone believe that a Trump presidency would look markedly different from his**offensive, erratic, stance-shifting** presidential campaign?\"\n\nPaper: **Detroit News**\n\n>History: Has only endorsed Republican presidential candidates since its founding in 1873\n\n>Headline: \"Gary Johnson for president\"\n\n>Choice quote: \"Donald Trump is **unprincipled, unstable and quite possibly dangerous**. He can not be president .... Trump is not a conservative .... Trump has attracted support from too many of those who represent the worst of human nature ....

They locked them up in the cell across from mine. These women didn't cry, didn't speak above an infrequent whisper. They were extremely quiet and orderly. They didn't crowd next to the bars. They just stood quietly by the hour and waited. I tried to speak to them but was told to NOT speak to them so refrained. I was curious and asked several times what was up and who these women were and was told to either mind my own business or \"You don't need to know\". They were all extremely young. From about 15 years old to early 20's at the latest. I could only guess it was something to do with prostitution based on what I saw but the silence and orderliness of these girls was puzzling. No one asked for anything and no one tried to speak with the officers. Just standing peacefully and quietly and evenly spaced throughout the cell. Anywhere from 75 to 100 women.

It's utter hogwash.\n\nNow, the reason voting rights groups sue to block voter roll purges is because, although those purges generally use excuses like this, they actually always end up removing a lot of real, live, legitimate voters, who don't realize they've been removed until they show up to vote.

This, in fact, shows that his pain *mattered* to him enough to relieve it via extreme means. \n\nUnderstanding his decision to kill himself is an acknowledgement of his bodily autonomy [a concept that the police that kill/abuse black people do not have in their repertoire of views related to POC humanity].   They act as if his life *does not matter* by ignoring him and his fellow BLM people that want the killings/abuse by police to stop.

A modest proposal: Why not just send a car over to all mentally ill people that ask for help and blithely shoot them immediately? That way the mentally ill person will not have to suffer the antagonizing and emotional breakdown that police cause with their hackneyed techniques for encounters with distressed people ? Screaming, cursing, threats, acts of violence, explosions, noxious substances, flashes of light, that \"overwhelms\" the subject. Of course this hammer is desperately seeking nails to hammer down no matter if the mentally ill person is not a nail at all.  \n\n\n\nThis overwhelming force \"technique\" to subdue people the police are in conflict with seems to be all they know. Just like they used on the Downs guy^* they suffocated over a movie ticket. He did not have to die, but the police are more like brutes with bloodlust than anything else in too many PDs. \n\n>An hour later, the young man was dead from \"asphyxiation by homicide,\" according to the medical examiner's report.\n\nAfter a public outcry [what if the Downs guy^* was black, would anyone even pretend to care then?] the department said they'd get training on how to handle either developmentally disabled people or mentally disabled people.

By adding power to the definition comma they can no longer be labeled racist or sexist themselves, because according to them black people ans women have never been in power. Which is absurd considering black and female mayors, CEOs, hell even a black president. The words racism and sexism had never had the definition included plus power.

Hence pointing out the \"*selective* outrage\".\n\nBut to answer your question straightforwardly in its own right, the reasons someone might be outraged by what the Bush administration did but not too terribly bothered about Clinton's email server could be that they're not the same, and what the Bush administration did that's being pointed out here was very sleazy and harmful, while what Clinton did looks like it was honestly intended to do her job well but happened to be a mistake.  She did not cause damage, except to her own reputation.  She didn't hide anything.  She's provided all the records requested, and fully cooperated with the investigation.\n\nIn contrast, the Bush executive branch hid nearly everything from their private email stash, including critical information about the lead-up to the Iraq war that most likely would've provided strong evidence of their intent to deceive the public into supporting an invasion on false premises.  They did not cooperate with investigations, and they appear to have done so in order to protect themselves from being outed for doing bad things.  In the process, they've also denied all of that material to history.\n\nNow, sure, it's reasonable for some people to be outraged by these actions of the Bush administration and *also* be very upset at Clinton.  But it's also perfectly reasonable for other people to be outraged by these actions of the Bush administration and *not* think what Clinton did was that big a deal.  Because they're very different; what many of the right wing accuse Clinton of is what the Bush administration did and Clinton did not do.\n\n[ Pretty funny to see this at -2 now.

One of those was /u/hackinthebochs who wrote: \"to highlight the selective outrage.\"\n\nc) /u/JTRIG_trainee wrote \"Why can't we be outraged at both at once?\"  It's a rhetorical question, of course, and people *can* be outraged at both, but it seems like /u/JTRIG_trainee was implying that there may not be any selective outrage.\n\nd) Part of my comment addressed the above, by saying that I thought /u/hackinthebochs was referring to the fact that people hounding Clinton about this *weren't* outraged at both; they mostly had no problem with what the Bush administration did. Hence pointing out the \"selective outrage\".  I guess I was a bit loose in that \"the people\" could mean \"every single person\", whereas what I actually meant was \"most of the politicians and pundits leading the charge on this, and most of the people pushing it on social media\".  I'm sure exceptions exist and I didn't intend 100%.\n\ne) **\"this\"** this context does not mean \"anything Bush might have ever done\".  It means, quite clearly and obviously, the Bush administration's use of private email servers, their longstanding obstruction of attempts to get those emails, and their deliberate deletion of large numbers of the most relevant emails that would've been both germane to the investigations *and* important historical archives.  People being outraged at Bush for skirting the UN, or coming up with the idea of invading Iraq for no reason, or gutting FEMA so it couldn't deal with Katrina, or any number of other things that were a big deal, is all utterly irrelevant to the point.\n\nThere, can you follow that without reducing it to idiotic strawmen now?

The ironic part is that the reason he used journalists to disseminate the information was because he recognized that he wouldn't be able to do so effectively.  \n\n> he released vast amounts of data, some of which he doesn't he understand.\n\nI get your point but this isn't exactly something a reasonable person would complain about.

The answer is obviously the reporters, who he had researched before releasing the data to.\n\n> I think that the data publicly released is just a small portion of the data he stole and which the Russians have access to.\n\nWhich is nothing more than a baseless accusation or wild speculation.\n\nTake another look at what happened but from a different perspective. An individual took classified information from the Government fled to another country and released parts of it via journalists.\n\nWho would do something like that? Either a patriot or a spy or somewhere in between.\n\nLet's look at other information to determine which end of the spectrum he most likely falls on.\n\nWhat were his living conditions prior to fleeing the country?  What were they after?\nIt's pretty well known that he had a decent paying job with quite a bit of power and respect in the organization and resided in Hawaii.  \nHis current state is less than ideal but was prevented from reaching his target of Argentina where his would be status is an unknown.\n\nThis is pretty much a downgrade so either he knowingly sacrificed his welfare or completely botched his escape.\n\nWhat information was released? What information want released?  As far as anyone knows the only information to be released was domestic spying programs and spying on allies.  We have confirmation that he didn't release all the information regarding tools used for spying on 'terrorists' thanks to ShadowBrokers recent release of some of those tools and offering to sell them on the black market.\n\nSo, we know that the information released supports his claim that he did so to inform the public about actions that he believed to be unconstitutional, he withheld information that would hinder the NSAs ability to do it's job against potential threats, and tried to release it responsibly by having a reputable third party investigate and report on domestic programs.\n\nIs it possible that he leaked the information to the Russians or the Chinese? Sure, but I believe it's unlikely.  If the Russians had the data why would the harbor him? If they didn't have the data why would they harbor him?  Have there been any accounts of hacking the Government which could be attributable to Snowden? Have there been any hacking attempts or successes against the government that were made public?\n\nObviously it's impossible to definitively prove that there wasn't any information given to the Russians or Chinese, you can't prove a negative, so we have to make an educated guess. You are welcome to believe he's a malactor if you like but the available evidence suggests that he acted selflessly or he's an absolutely brilliant spy who managed to convince a large group of technically informed individuals that he is a patriot.

That's just tribal logic and it's a well-accepted fact. \n\nThat's not *exactly* racism but it's pretty god-damned close. Put it like this: racism isn't new, nor confined to any particular place on the globe. It is inherent in humanity. There is no place on earth where a certain people are born *without any prejudice*. Just step back and realize that's all racism is: Prejudice.\n\nEven the Incas had preconceived notions that weren't based in any real experience or knowledge about the white-skinned, bearded Spaniards who came across the ocean. Definitively prejudice based on skin color, eg, racism in action. And of course the Spaniards weren't exactly beacons of reason either. \n\nThe trick is not \"don't be racist\". That's about as simple as saying \"don't sneeze\". Racism isn't a conscious thought for the vast majority, it's a knee-jerk reaction.^1 \n\nThe trick is understanding when you are being prejudiced against anyone and opening yourself up from that. Because *everyone* has prejudice. Everyone. None of us are innocent there. And when you start recognizing that similarity between us all, you can expand on it and grow it. And soon you'll have weened out that knee-jerk reaction. \n\nBut simply denying that you have any prejudiced tendencies in your mind... that's a mistake even Jesus talked about in the Bible: \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\". \n\n-------\n\n^1 ^(There is, of course, a small minority of conscious racists [Stormfront, et al], but that's a whole different can of worms apart from basic human instinct.

The most 'natural' dog you'll find is a German Sheperd, which has a large amount of wolf DNA left. But even that dog is not natural. A wolf is natural; they exist in nature and were shaped by natural evolution. Dogs have been shaped by human-driven evolution, which is not natural in the same sense.\n\nA poodle doesn't exist naturally anywhere. Neither does a chihuahua or a pug or a black lab or golden retriever. No where in history did any of these dogs arise on their own without humanity guiding their evolution (read, killing the rest that didn't fit the bill). \n\nThese are all of a species that humanity developed *intentionally*. We have literally bred the wolf out of wolves and killed the ones that didn't cooperate or didn't look like we wanted them to, over the course of thousands of years. \n\nThat's how we made dogs. It's kinda sad to put it like that, but every species of dog you know and just listed is the result of a generations-spanning genocide on dogs that bite humans or otherwise don't respond in ways we want them to. We have *bred out the wolf aggression*. We can't do that (morally speaking) to humans. People have tried. Even now, there's a TIL on the front page about Teddy Roosevelt's feelings on eugenics (he supported it). \n\nWe could breed racism out of the human species, sure, given enough time.

Sanders is a serous candidate, and I don't believe they will attempt to deny him the nomination if he gets the most regular delegates.\n\nThat may sound not too hard, 53%.  But how can he do that?

Unless something happens to change the polls in the remaining states, how can he win?  Sure, it was a narrow loss.  But he needed a big win.  Being close is good for proving you are a serious candidate.  But as been often said, to win, you have to start actually winning at some point.\n\nSure, things could change.

Republicans got him to promise not to do so, back in the early stages when the party still had a lot of power over whether he could compete in their primaries.  He promised.  As a result, I don't believe he has put together any signature-gathering operations to get on the ballot as an independent candidate in any state.  By the time the primaries end and the pre-convention wheeling and dealing begins, it will be much too late to get on a lot of states' ballots.", "id": "d18n0xw"}, {"comment": "That's obviously a best case scenario for the party.\n\nI don't know, I'm being cynical but flipping his position isn't something that has hurt Trump in the past.

As full disclosure I'd be all for Jim Webb, but am looking at throwing my vote away (lol) on the Gary Johnson ticket. Anyway, I'm talking a bit of realpolitik here: trying to predict the political attacks and arguments that would come about in a hypothetical Trump/Sanders race and who would gain from it**\n\nClinton has been softballing Sanders right now. Sanders has several political liabilities that Clinton cannot attack because she needs the progressive vote now and later in the general election. But Sander's political liabilities are things that any conservative nominee can put him on blast for. Trump especially because they play into his campaign climate/direction/message such as:\n\n**1)** \"Sanders represents (or rather could come to represent) everything about the hippy politically correct safe space culture.\" Like it or not, Trump is siphoning votes from people who feel that's a problem in the US right now. One could say his entire campaign climate is about this. Sanders won't lose votes, but Trump will definitely gain ones.\n\n**2)** \"Sanders didn't have a job until he was 40 but, Trump hit the ground running in business after college.\" Yeah, Trump did it with Daddy's money and there were a lot of mis-starts and failures in his early business ventures. But I don't see too many people caring about that. They'll respect that he always kept moving forward and building a business or a brand. In Sander's case, well, Obama got hit hard with the \"community organizer\" rhetoric and even then he spring-boarded his work in the Chicago political scene to a Harvard law degree and work as a civil rights attorney. Sanders is the dirtier, hippier version of that with several failed jobs. And don't think those weird sex articles won't get brought up again. \n\n**3)** The socialism. Nobody can hammer that better than Trump. This is a big problem for Bernie: his record and proposed plans are social democracy NOT democratic socialism like he's been saying. And there's a big difference between those two. In reality Sanders is only slightly left of FDR and the New Deal (aka social democracy). This is part of his broad appeal. But his rhetoric, talking about democratic socialism, talking about a political revolution, being on record as supporting or admiring socialist and communist regimes... people could get onboard with Scandinavian social democracy. I'm not a huge fan but I can see it and accept it. But democratic socialism is well on that curve towards authoritarianism that is talked about in [political horseshoe theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory). And Trump, the supreme capitalist, will hammer that point hard. And although it is a completely valid criticism that Trump represents horseshoe theory from the right, I don't think that attack will land as hard.\n\nDoes Sanders have some comebacks to these critiques? Oh hell yes. Does this not even touch on Hilary's problems as a candidate? Yep. Does Sanders have several things that he can easily fire back at Trump? True again. But these points are things that Sanders is definitely weak on. I think political attacks will have a net positive to Trump, and I see a lot of Sanders supporters missing this. Trump and Hilary's liabilities are already well known factors that have been heavily brought up by their respective opponents parties for awhile. In Clinton's case, years. Sanders hasn't been raked over the coals hard by Republicans yet in the wider presidential race and that is a liability if for no other reason than its something novel/new to talk about while criticism of Trump isn't new at all.", "id": "d18lwbg"}, {"comment": "Nicely put.", "id": "d18ncho"}, {"comment": "https://i.imgur.com/eU7C8lM.jpg\n\n... but I don't think you're right, unfortunately. :(", "id": "d189tp2"}, {"comment": "Baghdad Bob, ladies and gentlemen.", "id": "d18h6bg"}], [{"comment": "That means that any state in which he gets fewer than 58% of the delegates, even if he wins that state, he's falling further behind where he needs to be.

Remember, he doesn't just need to win a few states by >58%, he needs his average over all states to be above 58% - and that's weighted by delegate numbers. Win two tiny states by 65-35 and then win one very large state by 52-48... and the net result of that winning streak would still be that he's further behind on his chances of overcoming Clinton's lead.\nI'd like to see him win as many states as he can from now on, and I hope he has a few more \"big news\" wins like New Hampshire and Michigan.

I agree with you on that.   If you're protesting in a public place, people have the right to photograph you and record the protest.

But I really don't think it's a good idea to demand a professor step down because you don't agree with them.\n\nFundamentally, though, I think that people who keep calling these \"safe space protests\" are really missing the point.   This isn't about \"safe spaces\"; the protests are really about people who feel that their universities have pervasive racist attitudes that are to some extent allowed by the leaders of the university.  And in Missouri, at least, that seems to pretty clearly be the case.  When black people who are adjunct professors at the university come out and say that they've had racist epithets hurled at them by *other professors at the university*, there is clearly a cultural problem of racism at the university, and it probably comes from the top.   And it goes all the way down, as we saw from the people arrested for making death threats against black students on social media there.   \n\nIt seems that there really is a problem with racism at the University of Missouri, and probably many other universities.

It's just a different part of free speech. It's not censorship for them to shout via their platforms their opinions. Opinions mostly don't matter, right? They can call you whatever names. The problems come when others believe them, I suppose. It's hard to get a job when you're labeled a racist or a sexist, even if you are not really those things.

The Supreme Court has upheld far tougher sentences for less serious or, at the very least, comparable offenses. See Lockyer v.

Estelle, 445 U.S. 263 (1980) (upholding a life sentence under Texas\u2019s recidivist statute for obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses). And we and other courts have done the same. See, e.g., United States v. Tolliver, 730 F.3d 1216, 1230\u201332 (10th Cir. 2013) (upholding a 430-month sentence for using arson in the commission of a felony); United States v.

That's how this shit happens, and it's why you wait to confirm a god damned threat before you start endangering lives.  Nobody ever said that protecting and serving the public meant you don't have to take risks.\n  \nDo you even know how many police are actually killed each year in the line of duty?  I'll even look the number up for you.  In 2014 it was 49 police in the United States died of violence in the line of duty.  (Total deaths are higher but a majority of the total are accidental deaths or deaths related to illness.)\n\nThere are about 765,000 full time sworn police in the U.S., meaning that the average officer would have to work full time for over 15,000 years before hitting even odds of getting killed on the job from an act of violence.  (Shooting, strangling, beating, etc.)\n\nThe scenarios you're obsessing over just don't happen very often.  \n\nAnd by the way, the number of people killed by police in the United States is on pace to exceed 1000 in 2015. One in five of those was unarmed. Putting it another way, police shoot 20 people dead for every officer who's killed, and shoot 4 innocents dead for every dead officer.  A majority of these deaths weren't even reported by police, the number in the official statistics being a bit more than 400 per year.  Just getting an accurate number has fallen on volunteers painstakingly going through newspaper stories one at a time.\n\nThere is not a problem in this country with police deaths.  There is a problem with police killing people, a substantial number of whom we can safely say were innocent.  There is a problem with police terrorizing their communities with all the cowboy gun pulling and barking orders that far exceeds the limitations of their power to do so, many of them seemingly not even knowing what those limitations are.  There is a problem with police constantly perjuring themselves in sworn paperwork and in courtrooms.  There is a problem with a culture of impunity where because of qualified immunity and police efforts to ruin the careers of prosecutors who dare put bad cops away they aren't sued or prosecuted when anyone else would be.  \n\nThis will stop one way or another.  The only real question police in the United States have is whether they stop it themselves, or the public stops it with legislative and executive measures that go way too far in reaction to decades of abuse.  Frankly I wouldn't blame them from taking guns away from most cops entirely, and making their statements inadmissible in court.  Police in the United States have so many 'bad apples' as the phrase goes that they cannot be trusted with either privilege.\n\nSources:\nhttp://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/10/the-counted-500-people-killed-by-police-2015", "id": "cx55pw5"}, {"comment": "We can go round and round on this but at the end of the day if the public would simply follow the law we wouldn't need cops.

This mentality allows a very small minority of the population to take advantage of the vast majority of people, and ultimately it hurts society a lot more than it helps.\n\nAnd this is why I say you don't believe in some morality.

We can block them off but we are just moving our labor sales into a haven.  Welcome to the other-side of the perception.  So there is no moral here outside of hedonism.

My wife once worked for a POS lawyer who had a monopoly on a very lucrative market segment in his County, so he was very wealthy. He collected very bad art (he thought it was great) and built a wing on his house to be his \"gallery.\" He had a big party for his \"opening.\" For a couple of weeks before the party, he had a different caterer bring in food for lunch for him to try, so he was able to scam free lunches for those two weeks. Finally he chose one, and then avoided paying them, or even discussing payment after the party for a long time. When he finally talked to them, he complained that one of the coffee pots ran out for a few minutes, so he refused to pay for anything. The caterer was really angry, but he just told them that he was a lawyer, and they'd never find another lawyer to sue him.\n\nI worked for a major record company in the 90s, and one of our region's biggest accounts was a supplier to a very major discount department store that is a household name. It was nearly impossible to get them to pay for what they'd purchased. At one meeting, our branch manager announced that we had now reconciled all payments up to a date 5 YEARS BEFORE, at 50% off. So we had to wait 5 years to get paid, and when we did, it was at 50% less than everyone else had paid. Of course, there was still the last five years to negotiate, which would probably take another five years until a resolution.\n\nMost people are satisfied just having honest dealings with people, but i have known numerous people who see that as a weakness to exploit. If your moral code dictates that you play fair, then that's an opportunity for them to gain an edge because they have no such moral boundaries, and are more than willing to cheat, steal, and take advantage in any way possible.

My local republican congressman like to put out a yearly notice to his voters about some of the ludicrous spending and actions our government has taken over the past year. \nFor example. We gave 1 million dollars to the National Institute of Health......and what did they do with some of the money.....They put monkeys in hamster balls and document their stress levels on a treadmill.

A couple years ago, in order to say they actually read the AFA (obamacare) act in session they brought in a speed reader. I watched part of it on Cspan and it was like listening to very end of a radio commercial for some new medication....its so fast you couldn't for a moment understand what was even being said. \nFormer Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it best (albeit probably accidentally), \"Well we have to pass laws in order to find out whats in them\" While you could argue that she simply misspoke I don't think truer words have ever been spoken about the congressional system of the US government. \n\nOh we are running out of money? let's just vote to raise our debt limit, and when the timer starts buzzing on running out of money, both sides point and scream at each other then start shutting off government services until one side caves.....Both the Republicans and the Democrats are guilty of doing this, why.....it's just the way our government works.\n\nRanting aside, what I would like to see is the republican party come together and actually hold another constitutional convention and actually/seiously address some of the bullshit that has gone on for far too long, but it's going to require some kind of huge disaster of some kind to make it happen cough cough trump cough cough.

The father, who was not identified, rushed in and grabbed desperately for his son. He cut his hand, but did not win.\n\nBy early Wednesday morning, authorities from Disney World, the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission had deployed more than 50 law enforcement officers in helicopters and boats to the Seven Seas Lagoon, desperately searching for the missing toddler. Divers and trappers were on standby, officials said, and they were using sonar technology. After nearly 10 hours of searching, authorities had still found no trace of the boy.\n\nTrappers had caught and euthanized four alligators, authorities said at a press conference early Wednesday. None seemed to contain any evidence they were the gator that snatched the boy.\n\nBut despite the expansive bodies of water they were combing and the immense power and ruthlessness of the animal they were looking for, authorities remained optimistic they\u2019d find the boy \u2014 but were vague about whether they believed there was any chance he could have survived.\n\n\u201cI do not believe it\u2019s a needle in a haystack,\u201d Florida FWC Executive Director Nick Wiley.\n\nSheriff\u2019s office spokesman Jeff Williamson echoed that hopefulness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep searching and searching until we can\u2019t search anymore,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nAs rescuers searched through the night Tuesday and into Wednesday, Sheriff Jerry Demings said his crews would not leave until they found the child. That remained the game plan by daybreak, when new crews of law enforcement arrived at the Disney complex to offer \u201cfresh eyes\u201d for the search.\n\nAuthorities did not release the name of the child or the child\u2019s parents, but said grief counselors and victim advocates had sat with the family throughout the night. Their grief, Williamson said, was incomprehensible.\n\n\u201cThey are very shaken up, extremely shaken up,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cImagine if it were you? What would you be?\u201d\n\nThough alligator attacks are rare in Florida, this case \u2014 inside Disney World, involving a very young child \u2014 seemed to hit all involved especially hard. Williamson said many of the law enforcement officers on scene have children of their own and feel deeply empathetic for the boy\u2019s parents, who witnessed the entire attack.\n\n\u201cIt is tragic, it is heartbreaking. There\u2019s not other way to say it,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot come to grips with what it must have been like to be in that situation.\u201d\n\nWitnesses that were nearby when the alligator snatched the boy gave law enforcement \u201cdetailed\u201d information about what happened, but at an earlier press conference with reporters, Demings did not recount specifically what they said.\n\nOne witness dialed 911 at 9:16 p.m., Demings said. The mother and father, who at different points both ran into the water after the child, shouted for the help of a nearby lifeguard.\n\n\u201cThe parents diligently tried to get the child,\u201d Demings said.\n\nDemings said that, according to witnesses, the family had set up a baby pen about 20 to 30 yards from the water on the sand, reported CNN. With the parents and 2-year-old boy was a daughter, who is four, the network reported. A witness told CNN a movie was being screened on the beach Tuesday night.\n\nThere were no other people in the water at the time of the attack, according to authorities. Signs posted near the lake warn against swimming in it, but there were no signs warning of alligators. The sheriff said there had been no recent reports of any nuisance alligators in the area, but questions about their presence in the lake will be part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe gator that got the child, Demings said, was reported to be somewhere between four and seven feet in length.\n\n\u201cAs a father, as a grandfather, we\u2019re going to hope for the best in these circumstances,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cBut based upon my 35 years of law enforcement experience, we know we have some challenges ahead.\u201d\n\nFlorida hosts the largest alligator population in the U.S. and also made the creature its official state reptile in 1987, according to the National Zoo. An 1.3 to 2 million gators live across all 67 counties in Florida, the Orlando Sentinel reported in 2013, and inhabit fresh water marshes, swamps, rivers and lakes across the state.\n\nDespite that, Wiley emphasized Wednesday that alligator attacks are an \u201cextremely rare occurrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillions of people enjoy Florida safely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to be careful.\u201d\n\nSince 1948, 383 people in Florida have suffered alligator bites, according to Florida FWC records. Only 23 of those attacks were fatal. Last year, one person was killed by an alligator and before that, the last recorded fatality was in 2007.\n\nAlligators and crocodiles have jaws strong enough to crack a turtle shell, according to the National Zoo, and prey on fish, snails, birds, frogs and \u201cmammals that come to the water\u2019s edge.\u201d Their vise-like grip is nearly impossible to escape because the animals perform a spinning move, called the \u201cdeath roll,\u201d to drown and subdue their prey.\n\nOfficials told reporters that, according to records, this was the first alligator attack at Disney. Wiley said the Florida FWC works closely with the theme park to remove any \u201cnuisance alligators,\u201d or gators that are at least four feet in length and could pose a threat to people, pets or property, according to the Florida FWC website.\n\nWiley didn\u2019t know how often his agency actually removes nuisance gators from the park, and he wasn\u2019t able to provide an estimate for how many live in the waters on Disney property.\n\n\u201cEveryone here at the Walt Disney World resort is devastated by this tragic accident,\u201d a Disney official told reporters Wednesday. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family. We are helping the family and doing everything we can to assist law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe Grand Floridian Resort and Spa is nestled among Disney\u2019s sprawling complex, positioned just south of the Magic Kingdom theme park in the Orlando area. It stretches along the west side of the Seven Seas Lagoon, a man-made lake that park visitors cross on ferries in route to the Magic Kingdom.\n\n\u201cVictorian elegance meets modern sophistication at this lavish bayside Resort hotel,\u201d reads the Grand Floridian description online. \u201cRelax in the sumptuous lobby as the live orchestra plays ragtime, jazz and popular Disney tunes. Bask on the white-sand beach, indulge in a luxurious massage and watch the fireworks light up the sky over Cinderella Castle.\u201d\n\nA.J. Jain and his wife, resort guests from Georgia, were on the same beach with friends near the scene of the attack Tuesday night, reported the Orlando Sentinel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just here to say a prayer,\u201d Jain said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what those parents are going through. It\u2019s been one tough week in Orlando.\u201d\n\nThis attack is the third tragedy to strike the Orlando area in less than a week. Last Friday, 22-year-old Christina Grimmie, a former finalist on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice,\u201d was shot and killed by a deranged fan while signing autographs after a concert in the city. Less than 48 hours later, 49 people were massacred and 53 were injured inside an Orlando gay nightclub in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing our best to deal with all of the situations we have going on here,\u201d Demings told reporters Wednesday. \u201cOur staff is very resilient, and tonight they\u2019re very focused, if you will, on assisting this family.\u201d", "id": "d4a4zxe"}, {"comment": "Fuck you WaPo, and Thank you u/Superrocks!", "id": "d4a616e"}, {"comment": "Meh.

BTW, there was also stuff going on in China and northern Africa... maybe.\n7. The Magna Carta is signed. This is the first time someone said kings can't be tyrants. (Remember, tyrants are bad.)\n8. Columbus was so smart he was able to sail to America when everyone else was afraid they'd fall off the edge of the world. That's why we celebrate him.  \n8b. Columbus was so dumb he thought he was in India and killed a bunch of peaceful, helpless natives for no reason. That's why we vilify him.\n9.

As drafted, the bill would be paid for almost entirely from the overseas contingency operations (OCO) fund, which is not recognized as a real savings by the CBO.\n\nYeah, it was ok to spend ten times that a month on the war tho.\n\n>The bill would greatly expand eligibility for certain veterans to receive services from the VA health care system, which is generally reserved for veterans with service-connected injuries, disabilities, and lower thresholds of income.  This massive expansion of eligibility would further prevent those truly in need from receiving the care they need because the program would have to service a much larger pool of veterans.\n\nYeah we don't want to take care of MORE veterans. As few as possible please. After all, we won't spend the money to help them all so we must use what little we do spend more wisely!!\n\n>The bill also creates duplicative programs and fails to develop a system to weigh the benefits of existing programs.  Veterans currently receive assistance from the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAP) created by the Hire Heroes Act of 2011.  This program will be reauthorized at the cost of $1.1 billion, and new employment programs will be created, adding to the nearly half a dozen employment programs already in existence.\n\nTranslation: we've spent enough on you veterans, we wouldn't want to accidentally spend more on you when we're ably ignoring most of you already. That might lead to more of you getting help.\n\n>Even the VA and the Wounded Warrior Project have concerns with this bill\u2019s expansion of certain benefits programs, especially the expansion of the caregiver provisions.  As we note, \u201cCongress cannot saddle the VA with more responsibility until it demonstrates it can handle that which it has already assumed.\u201d\n\nThat's what it is. Until the VA shows us it has grown up enough to handle responsibility, we'll let our veterans suffer.

Legal gun buyers, buying normal modern sporting arms that millions of Americans own, and then using them to hurt people in a way that makes my stomach churn.\n\nStopping the majority of shootings requires a very different approach than stopping mass shootings. An app based, easily accessible, instant government background check that cost a dollar or something would be an excellent step. You could do a mini 4473 each time someone wanted to purchase ammo or firearms from anyone, and if they'd been convicted of a violent crime we could restrict them.\n\nBut see how that wouldn't have stopped any of these mass shooters, or anyone with a stolen firearm?\n\nIt's a complicated problem that requires a complicated approach.

So much of Chicago's gun problem stems from gun shops in Indiana who care too little about where their product ends up.  Some of the San Berdoo shooters' guns came from friends - these folks should be held culpable for the crimes committed with those guns.\n\nLiability insurance is another potential measure.

These factors include high rates of poverty, illicit drug trafficking, and substance use. For example, increased firearm violence has been associated with drug markets.\n* Diminished economic opportunities, high concentrations of impoverished residents, high levels of transiency, high levels of family disruption, low levels of community participation, and socially disorganized neighborhoods are risk factors for youth violence overall.\n* The presence of drugs or alcohol increases the risk of firearm violence. Moreover, criminals often engage in violence as a means to acquire money, goods, or other rewards.\n*  A number of individual behaviors and susceptibilities are associated with firearm violence and injury. Impulsivity, low educational attainment, substance use, and prior history of aggression and abuse are considered risk factors for violence (for both perpetrators and victims).\n* At the societal level, income inequality emerges as a powerful predictor of firearm homicide and violent crime. Research suggests that income inequality undermines social cohesion and social capital, which in turn, increases firearm violence (Kennedy et al., 1998).\n* Poor mental health, chronic environmental and social stressors, racial and income inequalities, gender inequalities, high rates of unemployment, and a lack of educational and employment opportunities are all associated with higher rates of firearm violence (WHO, 2002).\n\n", "id": "d491fi0"}, {"comment": "Source?", "id": "d48tho1"}, {"comment": "[Questionable source?](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5959776.html)\n\n[Never heard of this source](http://www.grabstats.com/statmain.aspx?StatID=1421)\n\n[Google has lots of sources, don't be so lazy and entitled!](http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/06/us/domestic-intimate-partner-violence-fast-facts/)\n\n\n", "id": "d49ock6"}, {"comment": "And yet not a single actual number of women who get killed via gun on those websites.", "id": "d4ac57z"}, {"comment": "Gotta actually real the articles, each one referenced 3 per day.

If the question is whether to die on one's feet or on one's knees, I would choose feet. \n\nYou seem to be overlooking that someone protesting is on their feet even if they don't have a weapon, though. The Tienanmen Square protester would have been no more brave if he'd been holding a rifle (arguably less so, I'd say). If he'd had a weapon, the guys in the tanks probably would have just shot him and moved on. \n\nRegarding fighting a government that is willing to slaughter people wholesale, remember that a government is not a ruler. To bring it back to the US (our original topic), if Obama sent in the National Guard to mow down Tea Party protesters calling him out for the unconstitutionality of his signing statements, how long do you think the National Guard would keep following orders? How would Congress react? The US Army?\n\nBack to Syria: arguably, the point at which things turned south for the opposition was when they took up arms. That fits the pattern: non-violence gets sympathy and international support, but violence gives governments permission to respond with violence. Someone who stands at a demonstration or walks out of their job in protest against an oppressive government, knowing he's likely to die, is just as much a hero as someone who picks up a rifle to fight back, knowing he's going to die. When the data suggest that the demonstrator is more likely to win out in the end (which they do), I'd say he's more of a hero than the guy whose primary concern is that he's not on his knees when he's shot. That's putting ego before results.\n\nI'm pretty confident that the opposition was doomed in Syria to begin with -- they're essentially the crux of a proxy war, and Russia's only naval base on the Mediterranean is there and Assad is their buddy -- but it's hard to imagine that sticking to non-violent resistance would have had a worse outcome in purely practical terms.\n \n1.

This is the case for the few legal AK47s in the country, they're grandfathered in.\n\nd) Yhey're definitely comparable, it's just actually hard to buy guns there. You can legally own a gun in Japan, it's just very hard. Same but to a lesser extent in Australia.\n\ne) Inconsistent laws state to state are both a boon and a curse for the US and federalism in general.

It's mathematically impossible that both sides are right about the fact that the other half of the county is *literally* an idiot.\n\nYour suggestion that democrats \"do everything in their power to tie your hands behind your backs\" is about as ludicrous as the comment above stating \"the republicans are literally cartoon villains\". Or am I to take away from this that about 99% of your great nation is populated by utter morons?", "id": "cxnwe4c"}, {"comment": ">IS is not going to take chances on a large scale sending their terrorists in with refugees when they've the money to find different routes, and when many of their attacks are performed by radicalized locals anyways.\n\nBut you can't disregard the idea that it could happen one way because it *could* happen another way. \n\nThink of it this way:\n\nIf you have a bowl of 10,000 M&Ms, 10 of them are cyanide and will kill you instantly upon consumption.

And i absolutely can't disregard the option, in fact it seems to have happened in paris already.\n\nHowever to make this metaphor work, we'd have to consider that the bowl we pour those M&M's into does already contain numerous cyanide ones, even though we bought them in the store around the block, yet we eat them every day. The percentage of cyanide ones we add doesn't seem much higher, in fact we check the ones we add and we do our best to spot them beforehand. If one of the existing cyanide M&M's kills us, we call it mass murder, if one of the foreign ones or muslim ones does, we call it terrorism. Or, harsher, if one of the first kills, we consider it unavoidable, if one of the latter does, we consider it avoidable. I would argue that that distinction is very superficial and doesn't make much sense, but the narrative sells much better, because it sounds easy.  \"Just don't let them in, and it won't happen.\" Nah, i don't believe that. I don't even believe it increase the odds as dramatically as they'll have us believe. We're dealing with pro's here, they would *love* to use the refugee-crisis to set of some attacks, as it would easily increase the effect tenfold, but it won't stop em if they fail.\n\nAlso, lots of the M&M's aren't really made of chocolate, they're more or less human and currently being chewed and digested against their will, or have moved from their homes because of various push and pull factors. Wether those are reasonable or not, is a different debate, as i would argue some are and some aren't, however to me it doesn't come as a surprise that a lot of people feel that at least some of those M&M's need a helping hand. To deny every single M&M because we already have our own cyanide and they might contain some as well may seem reasonable , however at the same time it results in not helping some people *because* they are being killed by others, and that does seem strange. \n\nI am not sure wether helping them or not will make any real difference to the safety of our society as a whole, even though the narrative who have us believe so. Terrorism is a viable threat, and in fact always has been. It was before the Syria thing, it will be after the Syria thing.

And I've read the Bible, the Koran, large parts of the Talmud, and the Book of Mormon, among other \"holy\" books.\n\nAnd when I went through a number of philosophy and anthropology and (especially) ancient & medieval history classes in college, I began to understand WHY I wasn't a believer. And why religion has NEVER been a force for good in human society.\n\nRevealed religion -- Judaism, Christianity, Islam -- has been a force for oppression and suppression for three thousand years. They have been used by the secular powers to enforce their will. Being based on the supernatural, revealed religion is innately anti-intellectual. It says \"You can't think for yourself, God will tell you what he wants you to do, and we speak on behalf of God.\" Religion is deeply autocratic and anti-democratic. It has been used to enslave and colonize and strip conquered people of their resources -- and then to tell them \"God wants it that way.\" Religion is also rigorously conservative and regressive. Science and technology have only progressed to the extent to which we have been able to free ourselves of the restricting and censoring forces of religion. If it weren't for religion, we would have gone to the stars by now.\n\nAnd anyone who claims atheism is \"just another religion\" understands absolutely nothing about it. You're just a creature of your church, parroting its propaganda.", "id": "d1hhnha"}], [{"comment": "While not a fan of his he is sounding like the voice of moderation from the right.

They have always been for free trade and against government intervention. That is pretty much their entire platform, and so I am not worried about him doing the right thing when it comes to that. \n\nHaving a president who isn't stubborn is a good thing.", "id": "d5vn21t"}], [{"comment": "Do any of you even know why you're against TPP?", "id": "d5vwr9l"}, {"comment": "This is a good question, and really deserves a good answer. The TPP is outrageously bad for a very long list of reasons:\n1: It makes it easier for large companies to send jobs overseas - The TPP includes terms that reduce the risks and costs of relocating production to other countries, including countries that still condone slavery and/or have minimum wages as low as 65 cents per hour. What this means is that companies remaining in the U.S. will have to compete with even more countries that can provide even cheaper labor.\n\n2: The Trans-Pacific Partnership has no expiration date - The significant majority of bills passed in congress have an expiration date. The purpose of this is to ensure that if a law does not function as intended or has unintended consequences, it will eventually expire unless an extension is passed in Congress. The TPP does not require that.\n3: Congress has no say in whether or not a new country joins the TPP - The executive branch alone (i.e. The President) would negotiate the terms and conditions for new countries to join the TPP, and then would vote (along with all other member countries, as part of a \"TPP Commission\") as to whether or not the new country be allowed to join.\n\n3a: Fortunately, it appears the TPP has been amended, because in previous versions, the TPP Commission would have been composed of CEOs of participating businesses who would then decide which countries may join and would even author new amendments to the TPP, which could then be voted on but not amended by Congress. I can't find that stipulation in the analyses of the current version, so I assume that provision has been removed.\n\n4: Environmental Safety - Previous Free Trade Agreements have required all member countries to \"adopt, maintain, and implement\" seven core Multilateral Environmental Agreements. The TPP includes these agreements, but only requires member countries to fulfill one of the seven and has weak obligations for enforcing it. Not only does this allow partner countries to pick and choose which environmental safety regulations to participate in, it already directly violates more than one of our own United States laws. Furthermore, it has 0 provisions to prevent further Climate Change (meaning American companies who move production overseas enjoy the added benefit of avoiding all environmental regulations in United States law) and it would require the Department of Energy to automatically approve all Natural Gas exports to member nations.\n\n5: National Security Exceptions - Previous trade agreements included a Security Exception that allowed countries could \"opt out,\" so to speak, of specific provisions of those trade agreements if those provisions endangered national security. The TPP includes includes this same Security Exception, but waters it down to the point that it has little to no legal power.\n\n6: Financial Services Tribunals - The TPP would grant banks doing business in multiple countries the right to create Extrajudicial Tribunals to enforce a shady and obscure \"minimum standard of treatment\" for foreign investors. The oversimplified explanation of this is that foreign banks would be allowed to sue the United States Government for taxpayer dollars if U.S. law prevented them from making as much money as they want however they want.\n\n7: Medicine Patents and Extensions - The TPP would grant medical corporations exclusivity to new drugs and medical procedures for up to five years from the time of their invention (meaning those companies would hold a monopoly on that new drug or service for that time period). This is not new to U.S. law (and is a common source of the outrageous prices Americans pay for medical treatments), but most proposed member countries do not currently have laws like this and the TPP would force them to. Worse, the TPP grants those companies the rights to file an indefinite number of patent extensions in all member countries, meaning those companies would be able to extend their monopolies on their drugs and services indefinitely. No more generic drugs, folks. Everybody in TPP member countries pays full price\n\n8: Copyright Provisions - The TPP contains 0 provisions for Fair Use under copyright. It extends our own copyright terms by twenty years and enforces those terms on six other member countries. (For perspective, we already have a problem in which copyrights last so long that they often outlive their creator! There are hundreds of thousands of works that are nearly impossible to access because their copyright holder died of old age, but the copyright is still in effect!) Further, these copyright provisions would empower DRM on software and hardware in such a way that they would effectively ban your right to meddle with your own device and enforce punishments that are disproportionate to the actual damages to the company in question. Want to jailbreak your smartphone? Voiding the warranty would be the least of your worries. Under the TPP they could seize your device, throw you in jail, and fine you hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\n9: Removal of U.S. Tariffs - The United State free market would be open to participating countries immediately and with no tariffs, while other countries (Vietnam, for example) would be allowed to maintain their tariffs for years. This further empowers companies outside the United States to have unfair trading advantages. This alone is estimated to cost us $55 billion and 330,000 jobs as companies leave the U.S. to avoid this problem.\n\n10: Procurement - The TPP would require all member countries to treat foreign jobs bidders as if they were domestic bidders. This means that not only would we be forced to accept foreign labor, but if we created a Stimulus package to help our own economy, we would be required by the TPP to spend that stimulus on foreign companies and countries as well. This would drive down the wages of construction workers, likely harm construction standards, and we would be forced to accept the environmental cleanup standards of foreign companies, even if they're weaker than our own.\n\n11: Rules of Origin - A product consisting of only 45% American-made parts would qualify as Made in America and all of its parts would be exempt from Tariffs. (This would probably most effect the automotive and airline industries. It would empower American car and plane manufacturers to manufacture the majority of their parts overseas, for cheaper labor) Worse, this particular provision is ridden with loopholes that could potentially allow companies to justify their parts as having been made in America, even they weren't, driving down the percentage of American parts that need to be made in America.\n\n12: Biotechnology and GMOs - The TPP grants new trade protections to companies selling genetically modified products. This would require all member nations to accept genetically modified products from all other member nations, and would grant all member nations the ability to challenge regulations other member nations place on genetically modified foods within TPP Tribunals that have special pro-industry rules, rather than through the usual avenues.\n\n13: Constraints on food safety provisions - The TPP would remove some of our import safety provisions and allow member countries to challenge the border inspection procedures of other member countries. This is especially bad. The FDA already only has the resources to inspect 1-2 percent of the food we import, and they've already spent years rejecting food from some of the proposed TPP member countries. Vietnam's fishing industry, for example, utilizes slave labor to catch and export fish with toxic and sometimes lethal levels of mercury. If we stopped their fish at our border, they could challenge our inspection procedures and force us to allow their food through. Imagine Flint, Michigan on a nationwide scale.\n\nFor more information, check out the Citizens.org TPP Analysis (25 pages) for why it's bad.\n", "id": "d5w2lld"}, {"comment": "Does the Citizens.org provide citations of the actual text?", "id": "d5wlwaj"}, {"comment": "Why?", "id": "d5wmte0"}, {"comment": "Because I want analysis to help me parse the text and draw my own conclusions.i would then seek out additional points of view if I find their interpretation of it suspect.", "id": "d5woxgl"}, {"comment": "Good on ya.

It is one of the worse things to hit America, didn't make anyone safer, and every part of it was used in ways that the public didn't realize it would be used for.\n\nExample: **Federal Death Penalty Act**\nTitle VI, the Federal Death Penalty Act, created 60 new death penalty offenses under 41 federal capital statutes, for crimes related to acts of terrorism, murder of a federal law enforcement officer, civil rights-related murders, drive-by shootings resulting in death, the use of weapons of mass destruction resulting in death, and carjackings resulting in death. \n\nSounds good in theory. Punish heinous crimes. Got it. How was it used? In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that inmates, under most circumstances, can file only one petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Nothing about these heinous individuals, this would apply to literally all those convicted. [Additionally 3 more additional brutal restrictions on habeas corpus](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/speed.html) would also apply. To everyone. If you knew of how people's rights were being curtailed  left and right from what are essentially technicalities like the 3 restrictions, such as the 1 year statue of limitiations to file, the presumption of Constitutionality by states, and the restriction of advancement \n\nAnother example: **Curtailment of Judicial Discretion** The 1994 bill severely handicapped the judicial branch's ability to use judicial discretion in sentencing , for what was normally used to individually tailor sentences based on mitigating factors. **This is where the three strikes law was also formed, for lifetime sentencing, regardless of how small the felony was provided it was a felony.** An example of this is would be smoking pot on federal land, like a federal park, or Native American reservation. Do you know how many Native Americans are spending their entire lives over \"crimes\" like this when it's legal in so many states? **I'm not sure you understand how heinous the 1994 bill was.

According to wikipedia, semi automatic weapons are allowed in Austria. Again, I don't know the details of Austrian law, but in the United States, there is no functional difference between a semi automatic hunting rifle and an \"assault weapon\".\n\nHow am I supposed to draw any kind of logical point when both you and the video use all kinds of vague, ambiguous language to the point where I have no idea what kind of guns you are talking about? Are you talking about fully automatic assault rifles? Because like I said, those have been legally off limits to poor people for decades, and I think the last time a legal one was used for a crime was probably around 50 years ago. If there are literally no crimes being committed with legal assault rifles, what regulations are NRA actually proposing that would have an effect on crimes in which assault rifles are being used? Owning an illegal assault rifle is a double digit prison sentence right now BTW. \n\nThe only legal full auto weapons are grandfathered from a certain date (1964?), which has restricted the supply, driving up the price. Technically you only need a $200 dollar tax stamp to own a full auto, but realistically you need at least a few thousand dollars, in many cases $10,000+.\n\nIs it hyperbole to say that that only wealthy people are allowed to own assault rifles? Maybe a little. But if you made pot legal and set the price at $10,000 per ounce, I don't think anyone would hesitate to say that poor people are not allowed to smoke pot. The law does not literally come out and say it, but that is the practical effect in both scenarios. \n\nI don't have to define poor, but if you can afford to drop a couple grand for a legal assault rifle which has no practical use, you're not poor. Especially considering that you can take many cheap readily available semi auto weapons and convert them to fully automatic function with basic hand tools. Anyone can get their hands on a full auto weapon if they really wanted to. \n\nAnd you might want to look into the definition of an ad hominem if you really want to call people out for using logical fallacies.

To set things straight, despite how the mainstream/social media is portraying it, it is NOT a cure for AIDS or cancer, nor is it even an AIDS medication. \n\nDaraprim is actually an anti-parasitic. \"Known generically as pyrimethamine, is used mainly to treat toxoplasmosis, a parasite infection that can cause serious or even life-threatening problems for babies born to women who become infected during pregnancy, and also for people with compromised immune systems, like AIDS patients and certain cancer patients.It can also be used to treat or prevent malaria, and certain other protozoa (single celled organisms) parasites.\n\nTuring Pharmaceuticals is selling Daraprim for GlaxoSmithKline (the manufacturer). Generic pyrimethamine is available all over the world from multiple different manufacturers.\n\nTuring Parmaceudticals bought the BRAND!  The Brand Daraprim, NOT the exclusive patent rights because it is NOT patent protected.  Anyone can produce a competing product.  \n\nThe drug in question has not been refined for 60 years because NOBODY until Turing had enough profit on it to make it better.    \n\nAnd despite the high price increase, those who can't afford it can get it for FREE/cheap from their company website.  http://www.daraprimdirect.com/patients\n\nSo why the price increase?\n\nThe problems for this case and many others are several fold:\n\n* This drug is available in many countries; but, because of strict import laws on pharmaceuticals, it can't be easily brought into the US\n\n* FDA regulations make it prohibitively expensive for other companies to make generic drugs, and because this drug serves a small market, no other companies found it necessary to create their own generic in the meantime.\n\n* The majority of countries around the world participate in collective bargaining with US Pharma companies forcing their prices down, and forcing the freer American market to be gouged to make up costs...\n\n* Since 3rd parties (the Government & Insurance) foot the bill, this eliminates free market supply/demand pricing and makes it possible for people to overcharge the 3rd party without the consequence of losing enough customers to lose profits.\n\nOr to put in another way, you are buying drug X for $5.00, while drug Y costs $7.\n\nDrug X and Y do the same thing.\n\nYou pay out of pocket for drug X.\n\nDrug X raises it's prices to $10.00 a pill, and you make the rational choice to start buying drug Y for $7.\n\nHowever that does not happen because the people getting this drug(and most other drugs) dont actually pay for them.\n\nThe majority of people who will have to take this are on Medicaid. \"Medicaid has played a critical role in HIV care since the epidemic began, and is the single largest source of coverage for people with HIV in the U.S. It is estimated to cover half of all people with HIV in regular care\" http://kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/medicaid-and-hivaids/\n\nInstead when drug X is raised to $750, the existing market for Drug X may be 20% out of pocket, 40% Government paid, and 40% insurance paid.\n\n So Drug X loses all of the Out of pocket customers, and half of it's insurance customers. However, they now still get to keep 60% of their prior market while making MUCH MUCH MORE money.\n\nThis is what Shkreli was doing.  He's gouging insurance/government, like EVERYONE ELSE in the industry does.   He NEVER expected people to pay out of pocket for the drug, and they won't, this could never be possible from only private customers.     It will get paid by government/insurance, because government/insurance involvement is the reason this is possible. That's why he can proudly say that those who can't afford it will get it free from his company, it's no skin off his teeth.\n\nBottom line: there is no alternative source for Darapim in the UNITED STATES (though generics are available in other countries, as Turing only owns the US rights to the drug), because it's not economically feasible for a competing manufacturer to make the drug, due to the low volume and low demand. Just not worth it, to invest in the factory, equipment, and monumental amount of legal and regulatory paperwork for FDA generics ANDA approval. But if Turing continues to milk the cash cow, it may become viable for another company to come in and drive them out of business.

This is already done for larger weapons deemed \u201cexpensive enough and consequential enough\u201d, says Lincoln Bloomfield, a former State Department official for military and political affairs who served as a special envoy under George Bush junior. Doing the same for small arms would be expensive, but the transmitter could be cleverly attached so that removing it disables the weapon.\n\n>Another alternative to GPS transmitters would be to track weapons by outfitting them with the inexpensive SIM cards that allow mobile-phone networks to identify subscribers. A weapon would communicate with nearby mobile-network towers to indicate its position within a rough area, says Mr Kalbusch. And a system of this sort could, in theory, form the basis of a \u201cremote control\u201d feature, allowing weapons to be disabled from a distance.\n\n>TriggerSmart, a company based in Limerick, Ireland, has developed a motorised mechanism that can block or unblock the trigger of an assault rifle. It is controlled not by a switch on the weapon itself, but rather by a command sent from an aircraft, satellite, mobile-network tower or radio station. Weighing less than 30 grams (including a standard AAA battery), the mechanism allows an \u201coffending weapon\u201d to be remotely disabled, says Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy, TriggerSmart\u2019s head of research and development.

Go to the shrink every three months, be prescribed an assortment of SSRI drugs, see a therapist maybe once a week or two. Other than that, 'good luck out there buddy.' And the mom was left alone to deal with him.

It's pretty standard because that's about all that can be done at a facility and it seems to work for a variety of low-risk patients.\n\nHowever, Adam Lanza, an Asperger Nervous Schizophrenic with OCD isn't a low risk patient.  \n\nThe mom was left alone with him because of divorce - which is common when one of the parents have the genetics to pass down schizophrenia.  The mom was a gun nut with dozens of guns.  She took him off Celexa and away from therapy.  \n\nThe Connecticut shooter wasn't a low risk patient.  It was obvious that he needed mental health assistance in several intense forms.\n\nHaving coaches around, employers willing to work with people, good neighbors - only goes so far.  The mom had all the monetary support in the form of child support and alimony that she required to spend lots of time with him and get him the resources he needed.  Support isn't going to help when she's also incapable of assistance because of her mental instability.\n\nPeople should give effort and volunteer?   They do!  There is only so much that can be asked of general society.  Handling a Aspy Schizophrenic is NOT one of them!  The general population isn't taught how to deal with this type of person and they are more likely to make the situation worse while trying their hardest to help.\n\nThat is asking too much.  That's why there are mental hospitals - for people that need full time care.  Because there are people out there that are a danger to society through no fault of their own.   \n\nIf you think that neighborhood assistance is the key factor in integrating seriously mentally ill people into society, then you should reconsider.  Seriously mentally ill people disturb and harm healthy neighborhoods.   You want some neighborhood assistance for the teen anorexic?  Fine.  Good idea.  How about the kid who stutters and has a harder time communicating not only from stuttering but from a social disconnect causing mild depression?  Sure.

He said, \"Best advice I can give you right now: do not make a big deal out of this...It's not getting taken down. I've said that. And it's not a very serious matter.

While there are probably relatively few users today who remember the incident well, and certainly many fewer who are willing to engage in the kind of full-throated defence of violentacrez that was often seen back then, it is a fact that the general opinion of the reddit userbase towards Gawker Media can be directly traced back to that series of events.", "id": "d6vhclr"}, {"comment": "I've been on reddit since that dox and am aware of their privacy concerns along with the commonly reposted Jimmy Kimmel Gawker Stalker video.

Over the past few weeks I had to move from my home, change my cell phone number, and disable social media accounts. On March 28, 2016, a viral video was released that intentionally does not capture the full context of an encounter. While passing out flyers in Malcolm X plaza, I saw a white male approaching with dreads. Triggered, I unconsciously move my arm holding the flyer further. He does not approach me to receive a flyer and continues on to his destination. Attempting to react to what triggered me, I jokingly say in a quiet voice \u201cNot with that hair\u201d in the opposite direction of him. My intention was to collegially provoke thought within the man to critically think about his dreads and the racial implications it has as a non-Black person. During the entire incident including what was caught in the viral video, he never refers to the flyer, which he later would intentionally report to the police in order to create a \u201chate crime\u201d narrative over the flyer. Rather, he then verbally assaults me. He called me a \u201cBitch.\u201d As a black woman, verbal assault by men comes easily as women are dehumanized, objectified, and over-sexualized by them. I look for the man, going into the building, naturally, to confront him about the verbal slur, tired of being silent. Tired of being docile. I asked him \u201cDid you call me a bitch?\u201d He denied having called me a \u201cBitch.\u201d He then asked me why I said that about his hair.\n\n>What was recorded was chopped and edited by the White male who captured part of the event on his cell phone. The White male student\u2019s motivation is suspect in that it does not come as an objective point of view, by his own divisive word choice of \u201cassault\u201d (in the title of the video when posted), in order to incite controversy by framing me as the stereotype of the \u201cAngry Black Woman\u201d and the man in the video as a fragile white victim. He selectively edits only a portion of the encounter that contrives to cast an impression of unprovoked aggression on my part. He says in his interview that he deliberately roams around campus looking for encounters to record on his cell phone. In the video, the conversation between the white male with dreads and I was intended to be a learned opportunity. My facial expressions were never negative nor was my body language. His body language was already energetic. The male had the opportunity to try to explain to me how I should think about my space and existence as a Black person. He dismissed any consideration that I was making a valid point about White appropriation of Black culture. After, he begins to walk away. I tried to continue to talk to him. It frustrated me that I didn\u2019t get the opportunity to have a voice. He touches me first. He touches me first (at 0.19 seconds). He places his hand on my arm to move me away to leave from the conversation. You can see this nineteen seconds into the video. I naturally respond back with touch. I nonviolently place my open hand on his shoulder. I nonviolently pull on his arm, urging him to come back to the conversation. It has not been legally deemed assault.\n\n>You can tell me that the decisions I made are right or wrong but what we need to focus on is the wrong in the response to the video. In the aftermath, I have been the subject of violence in the form of death threats, rape threats, sexual harassment, and anti-Black hate speech. Davia (David) Spain has received homophobic slurs, death threats, hate mail, and the release of their personal information although they did not take part in the incident. Further, the racist and misogynistic vendetta against me has resulted in my own personal information including home address, phone number, social media accounts, places of employment and other details about my private life leaked and mass distributed on YouTube comments, Facebook posts, and other Internet forums. To protect myself, I had to move from my house, change my cell phone number, disable my social media accounts, and have had to withdraw into a secured location in order to maintain my safety. In the process, my academic success, current work for my community, and future employment opportunities have been jeopardized. The countless hate mail, death threats, and disregard to my safety should not be the result of this video. No one deserves this compromise. There is a history of vilifying black women, there exists the stereotypical narrative of an angry black woman through out history. There is a reason that this particular video garnered millions of views. A black woman is portrayed as the aggressor and the white counterpart is portrayed as the victim. The language used to describe the video is suspect. \u201cBlack assaults and attacks white\u201d is harsh and does not deem the video of a justly cause. What the encounter can be described as is a nonviolent physical encounter between two students. It saddens to see this kind of hate in response. It saddens me that some people can\u2019t or choose not to understand my level of growth in regard to my culture and my blackness. The amount of ethnic studies class one takes doesn\u2019t invalidate their personal black experience. The amount of books one reads doesn\u2019t invalidate their personal black experience. There is no hierarchy to being aware of ones self and ones blackness. .What I did was my personal choice that shouldn\u2019t be receiving this kind of uproar.
