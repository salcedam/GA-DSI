As seen during the crisis, reliance on this type of funding left firms vulnerable to runs and fire sales, which may impose additional costs on the broader financial system and economy.", "Under the final rule and using the most recent available data, estimated surcharges for the eight GSIBs range from 1.0 to 4.5 percent of each firm&#39;s total risk-weighted assets. Because the final rule relies on individual GSIB data that will change over time, the currently estimated surcharges may not reflect the surcharges that would apply to a GSIB when the rule becomes effective.", "&#34;A set of graduated capital surcharges for the nation&#39;s most systemically important financial institutions will be an especially important part of the strengthened regulatory framework we have constructed since the financial crisis,&#34; Governor Daniel K.
