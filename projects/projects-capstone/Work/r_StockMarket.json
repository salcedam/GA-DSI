First and foremost for everyone reading this, DO NOT TRADE IN PRE-MARKT / AFTER-HOURS UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  Please.\n\nCompanies release big important news in pre-market and after-hours trading so as to not disrupt the normal flow of trading of their stock during standard hours.  Quarterly earnings reports, pharmaceutical test results, and other information that could dramatically affect the price of a company's stock is generally released during these times.  \n\nDramatic is the key word here.  There can be enormous swings in a stock price during outside hours when news is released, mainly having to do with decreased volume.  And because people want to make money on this news even though it's outside hours, you can place special limit orders that are executable in outside hours.  I don't believe many retail brokers allow for it, but there are some.  \n\nFeel free to ask anything else on the matter.", "id": "d57jzc5"}, {"comment": "The caveat to this is that if you're swinging anything overnight you are trading extended hours. What's even worse is that Robinhooders can't place orders until market open. Your stock could gap down in the pre or after market session and you wouldn't be able to react. \nThis basically means that you can't day trade with RH and you can't swing trade without taking large risks.\nFree trading sounds great until people realize the reasons they pay fees is for much greater control over order executions.

That includes as a market maker on the sell side - you would hang around after hours as needed but the buy side simply didn't need it.  On the buy side, again I rarely transacted pre/post market hours.  \n\nThere's plenty of volume during regular hours to support trading activities.

This represents value for investors to realize the value of the company as income that can be spent or reinvested.  \nOn the other side, dividends represent a financial motivator for companies, and this has been measured and proven time and again.  \nMore generally, investment in equity ownership has only the endgame of realized earnings through dividends. The price paid for a company is the expectation that it will eventually pay you back. Equities offer a significant value for investors over bonds, as these yields are unlimited both in time and quantity. Because of this risk and interest, prices for ownership reflect greater market cap for a company as it raises dividends (inline with ability to realistically and regularly pay them).

In 2008, the United States had come off of a Real Estate binge, and found itself hungover in and alley with the future looking very dark. This is when the Fed decided to begin spoon feeding the US this crack (low interest rates) in order to get it on it's feet. Once or twice the crack wasn't so bad for the economy, stimulating new companies, projects, and a venture capital boom. Well the drug dealer realized that the US had become addicted to this crack, and needed to ween itself off before it OD'd. The drug dealer started small, and raise interest a tiny amount. The US responded very well to this, but the drug dealer realized that some of the US' friends (China, Europe, etc.) who shared crack with the US were reacting very adversely. So the drug dealer kept the dosage the same for a very long time. Well, a year later the drug dealer decided it may be time to take another step away from drug addiction and the US reacted very violently in order to force the Fed to keep the current dosage. This violent reaction is today's movement. \n\nHonestly I think today was enough to scare the Fed away for another month. We'll see the market make up these gains next week when the rates remain unchanged. \n\nTLDR: The market is addicted to free debt, the Fed wants to take it away but the market is fighting to keep it.

This path will also lead to the greatest amount of stock price appreciation before the further-in-the-future hike, meaning there will be a hard crash.\n\n* Fed hikes, warns us (honesty): somewhat likely; just from the way the markets buckled under this one Fed guy's gum-flapping, we can say that the Fed is still credible, but remember the August jobs report a week or two ago? I really doubt they'll do anything with a foundation this fragile, since the rate hike is going to have some pretty far-reaching consequences that an economy showing this kind of pace might not be able to hold up against.\n\n* Fed doesn't hike, warns us (the bluff): most likely; if they want a smooth transition, they need to wait for strong macroeconomic indicators, which aren't there right now. If they want a smooth transition, they need to let out occasional hints of a hike to beat down the market so that stock prices don't grow too overvalued with these super-cheap loans they're throwing around.\n\nSo, in conclusion, it's a bluff.

Quite a bit of people messaged me this week asking if I would continue on with these weekly contest going forward from here ... and ... well ... I am happy to tell you all -- w/o a doubt HELL YEAH! Lol. Why not? I am all down for making this sub even BETTER and if it means running these weekly stock contest here to get members more engaged into the community here, then let's do this thang! :D\n\n\nThat being said, I will have to tell you all, I am not entirely sure I will be able to run the contest this upcoming week ahead due to the long holiday weekend we have here in the states this weekend. If you didn't know by now, this following Monday is Labor Day here in the states and the U.S. markets are closed.\n\n\nSo, I'm kinda looking ahead to the following week (the week of 9/12 - 9/16) to resume these weekly contests here.\n\n\nNow, as far as when you guys can expect to see the new contest thread up ... I originally had plans to post 'em up every Sunday's ... however after giving it some more thought, it seems Saturday's would be our best bet as that would give as many members possible the opportunity to see the thread thus getting a chance to post their picks up on the thread before the market opens that week.\n\n\nAs for the TIME of when you can expect said thread to be created ... probably anywhere between the late morning to the early afternoon on Saturday's...\n\n\nAgain, the next contest thread likely wouldn't be up until the week beginning 9/12! This would also be better since EVERYONE presumably should be back from their summer vacation trips and into their trading desks again! :D\n\n\nI will have posted all the contest rules and all the requirements that would be needed to participate on the contest so don't worry if you missed our last week's thread! They will be reposted on every new contest threads!\n\n\nWhelp, that's that! Again, I want to take this time to thank all of you who participated this week! It was a great trial run this week on r/StockMarket to see how these contests would do here. I think it was definitely a success on our first ever week.\n\n\nHappy long Labor Day holiday weekend to all of you in the states! Again, look for the new contest thread sometime on 9/10.\n\n\nEnjoy this last unofficial week of summer folks! I can't believe how quickly this summer has come and gone! Damn. :O\n\n\nTake care and be well all,\n\n-bigbear0083.", "id": "d77cgot"}, {"comment": "Nice Job !", "id": "d77fldw"}, {"comment": "Wow I did horrible!

Loose underwriting standards and companies going public before having a solidified business plan led to these valuations. The market reaching historic valuations doesn't signal a crash alone. What is the market pricing anomaly that drove the DJIA, S&P 500, and Nasdaq to new record highs?\n\n>\"Second, if Janet Yellen announces an interest rate hike, investors who are used to the low rate are going to become uneasy and pull their money, at least in the short term, creating a ripple effect.\"\n\nIt is important to consider that the Fed is likely committed to a lower for long policy. Traders believe the chances of a rate hike this year are around 47% ([Source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-19/treasury-rally-repels-fed-hawks-as-rate-odds-fall-back-below-50)). Additionally, the Fed purposefully hints at interest rate hikes (i.e. the [FOMC Dot Plot](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-15/the-fed-s-new-dot-plot-chart) and press releases) to prepare markets for this scenario. \n\n>\"Third, big names like Robert Kiyosaki, Donald Trump, and Warren Buffett have warned that a possible collapse could be coming.\"\n\nWhile it is advantageous to listen to accomplished investors, I wouldn't predict a stock market crash solely because Donald Trump said so.

In addition, many of the withdrawn retirement assets will be reinvested in the market using a similar investment vehicle. \n\n>\"Fifth, the liquidity crisis that the mortgage market may be about to face will further hurt the market.\"\n\nAs I haven't heard much about a liquidity crisis, I need to read about this. Currently, one of the largest concerns in the real estate market is CRE ([PIMCO](https://www.pimco.com/insights/investment-strategies/featured-solutions/us-real-estate-a-storm-is-brewing)).\n\nYour concerns are definitely valid, but I think a correction is more appropriate than a crash.

", "id": "d6wmglb"}, {"comment": "That's not an easy question to answer. \n\nIn largely all historical stock market crashes asset bubbles have been present. The Great Depression was preceded by a real estate bubble and a stock market bubble. The dotcom bubble obviously lead to a significant collapse in equity valuations, and  a real estate bubble caused the Great Recession. With the Fed and many global central banks employing low and zero-interest rate policy, there is a legitimate concern that we have artificially inflated valuations through loose monetary policy. \n\nIf the Fed pursues aggressive increases in interest rates (i.e. 2017 - 2.5% and 2018 - 3.5%), equities and global markets in general will likely react very negatively. The degree of the reaction to an increase in interest rates will depend on the magnitude and speed at which interest rates are raised and a number of peripheral factors. It would be particularly bad if the Fed raised rates only to decrease them when concerns about slow economic growth and recession legitimize. \n\nIf Trump is elected on November 8th and proceeds to wage his trade war against China and Mexico, all products imported from those countries will become significantly more expensive. This punishes the consumer. Consumer spending accounts for 71% of GDP, and recently consumer spending has been one of the healthiest parts of the US economy. A Trump presidency likely would create a scenario similar to the Brexit in US markets, with valuations stabilizing in the near-term, but overall negative consequences for business in the long-term. \n\nAny number of black swan events could result in a stock market crash, such as another instance of a flash crash.

The first being the collapse of China.  \n\nChina is going to go through a banking loss cycle like we went through during the Great Financial Crisis, there's one thing that is going to happen: China is going to have to dramatically devalue its currency.  Depending on how this is done could severely threaten market stability.  \n\nThe other potential flash point is European banks.  European banks are not looking pretty and if the trend continues, we could see serious system threat from European banks.  \n\nLastly, I believe a major crisis in the confidence in central banks is inevitable.  People are eventually going to realize the corner the Federal Reserve is backed into and everyone is going to be heading for the same exit at the same time.

Independent shops have had to make upgrades to repair the bells/whistles which have hiked repairs costs and will not be able to make it in a market where most of the money is going to loan payments vs repairs. Add in a gas spike and secondary part market supply chain problem could cause some serious trickle down problems for a majority. Also effects people getting to work since the auto boom allowed people to work further distances from home. \n\nOther catalyst; palladium/platinum prices effect catalytic converters which is essential to pass EPA inspections. \n\nAlternators; added electronic systems pushed this market demands\n\nRust; this effects several areas of the car markets which is just starting to be identified as a problem with little recommendations to fix. Autobody repair shops who had to comply with insurance companies price fix and use after market recycled crap metal, excess salt on roads for areas that had bad winters with no industry standards in maintaining vehicles in those conditions and just the general lack of repair standards for rust problems that would increase those costs. \n\n\nThe good thing is that the car market is technologically advanced to provide people with transportation through financial tools that can allow people to pay per mile which will help the uber/rental market. This will also help the supply chain within the car manufactures and dealership repair shops to have control on where and how these cars are maintained.

If you go non-retail you'll find stuff for $50-100/month that updates at a millisecond level for charting, level 2, time and sales, etc, and those fees will be refunded to anyone who trades enough to need the data so they effectively get it for free anyway.\n\nNot trying to be a buzzkill but in reality, a second is like a lifetime in the stock market.

It doesn't. \"Reliable data fees\" is also not even remotely a concern, I keep trying to explain this in other comments but I certainly don't care for giving anything away so I guess just let that be my problem ;) \"Major infrastructure\" is also kind of a joke in my case, I have nothing I need to support.

I'd be VERY interested in seeing this video you're talking about because I use ToS every day and I've never seen it take 20 seconds to update anything. I'm wondering if maybe we have different definitions of the word \"update\" ... Are you talking about a chart changing prices and drawing new candles? Maybe there is just a misunderstanding about terminology or something. It sounds like you're implying that your software supposedly has price information 20 seconds faster than Thinkorswim or other trading software, so you're saying the data people are getting on ToS and other trading software is 20 seconds old?\n\nEdit: and if so...relative to what?

Also please understand you're repeating things in the thread, everyone gets bored of saying the same things but I didn't want to just ignore your comment. I also mentioned in my message to you that the feedback part of this is in motion, you're just a little late to the party so I'm not looking forward to hearing the same exact things anymore, that's all.\n\nIf I'm being defensive then I could just say, \"Agree to disagree!\" right here. \n\nBut to answer your question and humor your thoughts, yeah I could totally be misunderstanding you. \n\nAnd yeah, so far and in all testing, it would appear that the data from (at least) Think or Swim is 20 seconds old. I have video proof of this but it's a complicated matter and requires way more testing. For now, myself and others have observed about that much delay in the same readings from that particular software. We're looking at others with paid plans.\n\nThere are two parts to this. The speed at which we observe changes in the market and report them and also the \"lag\" behind those observations due to all sorts of factors. We're investigating the sincerity of this lag and if we're also experiencing a relative lag, even if it's less than Think or Swim. \n\nThanks for your interest.

Have a great Sunday, friend.", "id": "d2ohktl"}, {"comment": "What are you comparing the speed to? I'm genuinely curious, not trying to shoot down your idea. My point is just that if the data from ToS was 20 seconds old then anyone executing a market order would get a price vastly different (not just a little different, a LOT different) from what's shown on their screen, and anyone using a limit order to buy at or near the price on their screen would never get filled because the price would be so far gone by 20 seconds later. I can tell you for a fact that that doesn't happen as I traded with ToS for multiple years, and also now trade with different software which is slightly faster in terms of displaying updates and I know for a fact that the quote information I'm getting is accurate because I am trading on it and getting filled where I expect. Plus, it's pretty close to ToS data (ToS does lag by a half a second or so occasionally but that could be attributed to network latency or just ToS being a memory hog, or something else). Every day, I have ToS data and my trading software data running at the same time since I use ToS for intraday scanning on some patterns and can tell you for a fact it's not lagged by 20 seconds. If it was then it would imply that also my software is lagged by that amount and when I used a market order I would end up getting a vastly different fill price from what I'm seeing on my screen. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to understand is, are you implying that the true, accurate price quotes on the floor of the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges is one thing, and what you're seeing in Thinkorswim (and other software) is that data from 20 seconds ago?

", "id": "cynayn3"}, {"comment": "You're right... so long as you're prepared for a choppy market and your ideas of what low and high are constantly evolving and accurate.  The problem is, these are both unlikely to be true. \n\nEven if the market stays mostly flat and in a trading range, there are plenty of features that will trip up traders. First, we may experience lower highs, or higher lows. Imagine, for example, a slightly downward-sloped channel. If you buy low, and attempt to sell \"high\" but we experience a lower high and your idea of \"high\" was off slightly, it will simply come down, and since the channel is downward-sloped, the new low will be lower than the previous, and though you thought you \"bought low\" you'll discover the market is now \"lower\"... and if the channel continues, will go lower still. \n\nSecond, in a sideways market, we can expect \"range expansion\".  This is where the market attempts to make new highs and new lows, expanding the trading range from between 2100 and 2000 (ES / SPY), to the wider range of 2100 to 1850. We saw an example of this a few months ago. Right Now, action is still in the top 40% of the wider range, and many market players may be lulled into thinking the range is still just 2000 to 2100, which would be false. If you're buying \"low\" at 2000 thinking its the bottom of the range, you're wrong... it's the middle of the range. The bottom is 1850, and if another bout of range expansion occurs, could be even lower. \n\nAs for \"selling high\" during range expansion, it's worth noting that range expansion usually occurs after a protracted mini-trend of opposite signals. For example, after a small channel down convinces enough people that the trend is down, the market may range-expand to the upside. People will think they are \"selling high\" by selling at the top of this new channel... but the channel has progressed so far that the top of this channel is in fact now center-range.  If you think the channel is the definition of high vs low (ie top of channel is high, bottom of channel is low), then you'd be wrong as the market suddenly and all at once seems to disregard the channel you've been following. You sold at the top of the channel, but you were also at a significant support, and the market decided the support was stronger. You thought you sold high, but you sold low.  By overshooting existing highs, the market will trap more shorts covering and more longs hopeful of getting in at the start of the trend. Of course, those short-covering or getting long late in the action are in fact 'buying high\" when they should be selling high. \n\nWhy are they buying high, though? How did that happen?  Because they thought they were selling high when they sold at 2070 (perhaps expecting this to be the top of the downward-sloped channel), and the range expansion broke to new highs, and they realize that their idea of \"high\" was a bit outdated, or, oddly enough, a bit too \"fresh\", since you forgot the true high of the range and started trusting the newer weaker signals. Then they sell on what they see as the \"breakout\" of the previous 2100 high range to 2130 or something, and only when it comes back down do they realize that while they thought they \"sold high\" and \"had to cover higher\", what htey actually did was sold low and bought high. When it drops back down to center range, they'll realize the folly. \n\nSo yeah... buying dips and selling highs can work in a sideways market. Good luck keeping an accurate and up-to-date image of what high and low mean though. It's more work than you'd think.

It could even adjust the language in its statement to point more clearly at its next meeting, in December, as the time when it would hope to raise interest rates.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###The employment report Friday, always important, is expected to show that 175,000 jobs were created in October, and that the unemployment rate was a low 4.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. There are also dozens of earnings, including Facebook, BP and Pfizer, and other important data, such as Tuesday's auto sales and ISM manufacturing data.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###But in the last week of campaigning before the Nov. 8 election, the market could also be vulnerable to headline risk. Markets have been comfortable with the view that Democrat Hillary Clinton looks set to win the White House and that Republicans would likely hold onto the House of Representatives. That would create a status quo situation where there would continue to be gridlock. Wall Street has viewed GOP nominee Donald Trump as too unpredictable, and he has been trailing in the polls.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###Friday's revelation that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is reviewing new evidence in connection with its investigation of Clinton's email server shook markets, sending stocks lower. The emails were found during the FBI's investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, husband of a senior Clinton aide. Weiner is under investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit messages to a minor.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###\"The market has gotten pretty comfortable with the thought of a December hike which de-emphasizes some of next week's Fed meeting and jobs report, but this election is now turning into a situation with the potential for Brexit-like volatility,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Brexit is used to describe the U.K. vote last June to leave the European Union, which led to a temporary market sell-off.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said if Clinton wins, the investigation will be hanging over her. \"It certainly means that probably before the inauguration if the Republicans hold the House, there will be an investigation that lasts four years,\" said Cashin.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###Redler, who follows short-term technicals, said there were already some warning signs for stocks without the added election uncertainty. \"Breakouts are failing. Stocks are losing upward momentum, and the indices make it seem as if everything is fine and dandy. It's a push, pull,\" he said.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###The S&P 500 closed at 2,126 Friday, a decline of 0.7 percent for the week, but also below a key support level of 2,130. The VIX, the market's fear meter, jumped 5.4 percent to 16.19 Friday, and was up more than 20 percent for the week.\n> &nbsp;\n([CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL ARTICLE!](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/28/the-presidential-election-has-finally-become-the-big-threat-for-markets.html))\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dj7hANw.png))\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/10/26/20161028_EOD9.jpg))\n\n# **Treasuries for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE TREASURIES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/10/26/20161028_EOD3.jpg))\n\n# **Currencies for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CURRENCIES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/10/26/20161028_EOD7.jpg))\n\n# **Commodities for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE COMMODITIES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/10/26/20161028_EOD5.jpg))\n\n# **Bird's Eye View of the Markets on Friday:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL FUTURES MAP FROM FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/zUKoqQD.png))\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqAlF9R.png))\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JwaP47n.png))\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6hW5sMu.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: November Top Performing DJIA Month in Election Year**\n> November begins the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&P 500, and the \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November but don\u2019t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-three DJIA and number-two S&P 500 month since 1950. Since 1971, November ranks third for NASDAQ. November is best for Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 second best since 1979.\n\n> November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. The month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down \u201322.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month on record\u2014only October 1987 was worse.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/97712ebe99fa522efbadafe3e3ef8ca7/tumblr_inline_ofo8m3YX4i1spdppr_400.jpg))\n\n> November\u2019s is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 9 of the last 16 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.5%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&P 500 November ranks second with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #8, #6 and #8 respectively. Fewer years of data (11 for NASDAQ and 9 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Election Day: Bullish Day Before, Less So on Actual Day**\n> Looking back at the last sixteen presidential elections since 1950, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.41% and 0.33% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/fb0b092f653468acd0dbefd35dbcb5d8/tumblr_inline_ofmjrjTVkF1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: NASDAQ performs best on November\u2019s First Trading Day**\n> Based upon data in the now available 50th Anniversary Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac for 2017on page 86, the first trading day of November is the sixth weakest of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report third quarter earnings of 6 cents per share on revenue of $2.28 billion.\n\n> The company said it gained 370,000 net memberships in the U.S. and 3.2 million internationally, a total of 3.57 million, handily beating the 2.3 million the company forecast.\n\n> The company said in July it expected to add 300,000 subscribers in the U.S. and 2 million subscribers internationally in the third quarter. Analysts polled by StreetAccount 309,000 U.S. streaming subscribers and 2.01 million international streaming subscribers.\n\n> Looking toward the fourth quarter, Netflix expects to add 5.2 million net memberships, 1.45 million in the U.S. and 3.75 million internationally. That's above the 1.27 million U.S. streaming additions and 3.32 million international streaming additions expected by FactSet consensus estimates for the fourth quarter.\n\n> For financial guidance, Netflix expects earnings of 13 cents per share, above 7 cents expected by FactSet consensus estimates.\n\n> \"We are now in the fourth year of our original content strategy and are pleased with our progress,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders. \"In 2017, we intend to release over 1,000 hours of premium original programming, up from over 600 hours this year. The Internet allows us to reach audiences all over the world and, with a growing base of over 86 million members, there's a large appetite for entertainment and a diversity of tastes to satisfy.\"\n\n> Shares of Netflix's stock have fallen nearly 13 percent so far this year, as the company's outlook for adding new users has struggled to keep up with Wall Street's expectations. In the second quarter, it added 1.7 million subscribers, below its own expectations of 2.5 million.\n\n> Netflix has successfully added more original content, and has worked to add many local-language offerings abroad, dealing with disparate income levels, piracy regulations and broadband connectivity. Still, that can add costs, Tru Optik CEO Andre Swanston told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" before the earnings were released on Monday.\n\n> And this year, the company has \"un-grandfathered,\" evening out prices for longtime users who were temporarily \"grandfathered\" in with cheaper prices. On top of that, it has faced competition from live sports coverage of the Olympics and streaming services such as Amazon, Hulu, Sony Pictures, Sling TV, Crackle and Mindshare.", "id": "d8w7y62"}], [{"comment": "Wowowowowow", "id": "d8w9smy"}]]], "44r96l": ["Today's disaster de jour: CHK -40%", "2016-02-08 18:01:49", 27, "https://www.tradingview.com/x/tk73ANbT/", [[{"comment": "Today and de jour", "id": "czsb3ez"}, {"comment": "Covering all the bases", "id": "czsbcxi"}, {"comment": "Also, du jour*.

Amazon.com and Google's parentAlphabet are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###\"If nothing changes \u2026 we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###Next week, \"I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings,\" said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. \"I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy.\"\n> &nbsp;\n> ###A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October.

With six trading days left in October, S&P 500 needs to climb back above 2168.27 to avoid a third month. Should S&P 500 fail to reach this bar, it would actually be a positive for November as 20 of those past 33 streaks ended at three months and within one month of the end of all streaks, three months or longer, S&P 500 was higher 100% of the time with an average 4.72% gain. S&P 500 worst monthly losing streak since 1950 was nine straight in 1974. When this streak ended, S&P 500 also had the largest one-month gain, 16.3%.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20161021_SP500-3-month-losing-streaks.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Week before Election more bullish than week of or week after**\n> Election Day is (finally) just around the corner. Next week will be two weeks before and it is also the week after October options expiration. Over the past 22 years the week leans bullish with gains exceeding losses by a margin of nearly 2 to 1 and respectable across the board gains. However, this same week (not always the week after options expiration) has nearly the exact opposite track record in election years. Since 1952, DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced during the week only 37.5% and 31.3% of the time respectively. The week before election week has a bullish bias that exceeds election week and the week after.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/2a59e6f5929dc436bf682b6b03d5f287/tumblr_inline_ofd7u2bTmA1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: 8th Year pattern back in play in an undecided election**\n> Whether looking at \u201cAll Presidential Election Years\u201d or just \u201cEighth Years\u201d in the charts below, the market is usually in rally mode near the end of October. Should the election go as polls suggest then the market will most likely track the \u201cAll Presidential Election Years\u201d pattern to finish the balance of 2016. Should the election results be too close to call and trigger a recount in a state or possibly more, then the \u201cEighth Years\u201d pattern would be back in play. An undecided outcome similar to November 2000 (an Eighth Year) would produce great uncertainty and could lead to declines similar to those that occurred then. DJIA dropped 5.1%, S&P 500 plunged 8.0% while NASDAQ imploded 22.9% (tech bubble burst, not likely to occur again as valuations are not as extreme now) in November 2000. In the undecided scenario, it would not be surprising to see the Fed skip a rate hike in December in order to provide some relief to the market.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/f0a02ff07a9679988fec0a68f528fb2f/tumblr_inline_of9it701O61spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis for Week Ending 10.21.16** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7aEMIxWNmI))\n\n# **VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.24.16 - Questions from the crowd...** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFUbgkb9kQI))\n\n# **VIDEO: October 21 2016 Market Wrap and Sector Watch** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG_kyYvFduo))\n\n# **Earnings Releases due out in this upcoming week ahead:** \n> *$AAPL $AMZN $TWTR $UA $TSLA $GOOGL $CMG $BMY $F $V $S $TMUS $FCX $GM $CELG $T $AKS $LUV $KMB $CAT $BX $CLF*\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](http://i.imgur.com/XfgnFDW.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# REDDIT WEEKLY STOCK PICKING CHALLENGE\n\nThis week's stock picking challenge thread is now up!

Expiration day however, tends to be mixed with average losses across the board even though S&P 500 and NASDAQ have advanced more often than not. Entire expiration week and the week after also lean bullish. Of note is the small-cap index streak of 13 straight advances from 1994 through 2006 (not shown, the streak is actually 17 years starting in 1990) and it has been down in six of the last nine years. October\u2019s reputation for volatility can be seen with wild daily and weekly swings in the tables below. Weekly moves in excess of 5% occurred in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2011.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/ddcc83c7d4c8405d781769439112ec90/tumblr_inline_of04l8KQTt1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: DJIA performs best under newly elected Democrat Presidents**\n> In the below chart, \u201cAll Post-Election\u201d years since 1953 is the baseline to which \u201cAll 1st Elected,\u201d \u201cDem 1st Elected,\u201d and \u201cRep 1st Elected\u201d are compared. \u201cAll 1st Elected\u201d years are the first years of a new president. \u201cDem 1st Elected\u201d are first years of a new president that was a Democrat and \u201cRep 1st Elected\u201d are new Republican presidents. For the first half of a post-election year all four are quite close. Under 1st Elected Democrats DJIA was weaker in January and February on average as a result of early losses in 2009. By the end of July DJIA\u2019s performance begins to show significant deviation and by the end of the year DJIA has performed best under a newly elected, 1st-year Democrat. Should polls hold and Hillary Clinton become the next President, DJIA\u2019s performance in 2017 could resemble the green line. If Donald Trump can defy odds and polls then DJIA could follow the path of the black line.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/e06eebed097dd88b04d2d5b70b068a63/tumblr_inline_of04a0ExTA1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover**\n> Earlier this month we examined \u201cselling Rosh Hashanah\u201d and now let\u2019s take a closer look at buying Yom Kippur. Last week\u2019s table has been trimmed and condensed to show the last 26 years results. DJIA has advanced 22 times and declined just four times since 1990 between Yom Kippur and Passover with an average gain of 8.6%. The worst decline was 7.4% in 2000-2001 and the best was 25.4% from 1998-1999.

This second debate between the two candidates is scheduled for 9 p.m., ET, at Washington University in St. Louis and will take the form of a town meeting.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"I don't believe a Clinton win is completely priced into the markets,\" said Brian Muench, vice president of investment management at Allianz Investment Management. He expects a pullback in stocks by the end of the year, and polls showing a tighter race between the two candidates could contribute to the decline. \n> &nbsp;\n> ### The potential number of market-moving events only heats up as the week progresses. \n> &nbsp;\n> ### Earnings season unofficially kicks off Tuesday with Alcoa's quarterly results, and the meeting minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's September meeting are due Wednesday. New York Fed President Bill Dudley is also scheduled to speak that day.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### The climax comes Friday with earnings from major banks Citigroup,JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"For me, the real driver for markets the end of this year should really be third-quarter earnings,\" said Chris Wright, ultra high net worth investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. \"We'd be looking for quite strong earnings growth in the third quarter given we've got a fairly benign third quarter.\"\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Retail sales are due for release on the same day, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak that afternoon on \"Macroeconomic research after the crisis.\"\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"We'll be watching consumer data next week just to confirm we think the consumer is in a good position here,\" said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"Earnings and the retail sales and any Fed speakers will be closely watched as to how they digest (Friday's jobs) release,\" he said.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### The September nonfarm payrolls report showed creation of 156,000 for the month, below expectations, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent. Average hourly wages rose 6 cents to an annualized rate of 2.6 percent.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### U.S. stocks closed slightly lower Friday after the jobs report and snapped a three-week win streak. The S&P 500 ended the week at 2,153.74, weighed by a 5.3 percent decline in the REITs sector.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"While we're still two jobs reports away from the Fed meeting, there probably could have been some political implications for this,\" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management. But the data \"wasn't strong enough to crow about if you're a Democrat, and it wasn't weak enough to bad mouth if you're a Republican. It won't have a lot of effect on Fed expectations.\" \n> &nbsp;\n> ### The data reduced already low expectations for a November rate hike and added to general expectations the Fed will raise rates in December.\n> &nbsp;\n([CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL ARTICLE!](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/07/politics-earnings-and-other-issues-heating-up-for-markets-next-week.html))\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://i.imgur.com/fK97Zbb.png))\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/10/01/20161007_EOD10_0.jpg))\n\n# **Treasuries for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE TREASURIES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/10/01/20161007_EOD4_0.jpg))\n\n# **Currencies for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CURRENCIES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/10/01/20161007_EOD5_0.jpg))\n\n# **Commodities for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE COMMODITIES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/10/01/20161007_EOD6_0.jpg))\n\n# **Bird's Eye View of the Markets on Friday:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL FUTURES MAP FROM FRIDAY!](http://i.imgur.com/5gU0HpT.png))\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](http://i.imgur.com/zNbSzC7.png))\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/gkqWLDY.png))\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/meC6FcG.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Regardless of election outcome, S&P 500 advances 72.2% of the time**\n> For all the heated discussion, debate, worrying, slicing and dicing of numbers, the actual presidential election outcome appears to have little bearing on S&P 500 performance in November and December. Since 1944 election-year Novembers have been up 55.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.6% and election-year Decembers have been up 83.3% of the time with an average 1.4% advance.

As of today\u2019s close S&P 500 is down 0.82% and appears to be casting its vote early, against the incumbent party\u2019s candidate Hillary Clinton. Perhaps it is voting for Republican candidate Donald Trump or maybe for Gary Johnson of the Libertarian party. Admittedly it is too early in October to make such a call however; it is notable that S&P 500 has already deviated from its typical path in October compared to past incumbent party victories.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/03507a11cd45ad760cc5aff6ed7013ab/tumblr_inline_oejm9btdi51spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n> In the above chart, S&P 500 performance in October is plotted for \u201cAll Years,\u201d \u201cElection Years,\u201d \u201cIncumbent Victories,\u201d \u201cIncumbent Party Defeats\u201d and \u201c2016.\u201d Should S&P 500 continue to track the Incumbent Party Defeat pattern, weakness is likely to persist until near the end of October before a modest rally ensues, but still fails to return to positive territory.\n\n*****\n\n# **VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis for Week Ending 10.7.16** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoLxwy7UDMI))\n\n# **VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.9.16 - It just can't get any worse than this...** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgnTRGI5fHI))\n\n# **VIDEO: Market Wrap and Sector Watch Oct 7 2016** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzESgfQSM2U))\n\n# **Earnings Releases due out in this upcoming week ahead:** \n> *$AA $DAL $WFC $JPM $CUDA $FAST $C $VAC $PGR $CSX $INFY $FRC $PNC $OZRK $WGO*\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](http://i.imgur.com/pMwD0mC.jpg))\n\n*****\n\nBTW folks, don't forget to get those stock picks in for this week's r/StockMarket Weekly Stock Picking Challenge!\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE TO POST YOUR PICKS FOR THIS WEEK!](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/56ccki/rstockmarket_weekly_stock_picking_challenge_for/))\n\n**(RATIONALE FOR BOTH PICKS IS REQUIRED!)**\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you guys watching this weekend?

That comes out to about 4 months or 86 consecutive trading days! Evidently we haven\u2019t seen anything like that since the first half of 1995! At the same time, the thing that makes this streak strange is that in 1995, 34 of those 86 days made new ATHs, versus just 10 new highs during this recent streak.\n\nHere\u2019s another way to look at things: The S&P 500 has now gone 53 straight days without a new high, yet every single day it has closed within 3% of the highs. This is the longest such streak since 1928, topping the previous record of 48 straight days in late 1993. Yowza!\n\nIn other words -- NOTHING has happened for the indices essentially since July lol.\n\nHistorically, October has been the most volatile month, but that has not held true at all in 2016. With just 1 trading day left to go in October, only one day this entire month has closed up or down 1%. You have to go back at least 10 years to find the last time October was that tame. Coming into this month, who thought that would happen? Seriously.\n\nBut wait! There's more lol ...\n\nDid you also know that the DJIA is doing something extremely rare. For 36 consecutive trading days now it has closed above its daily 200sma, but under its daily 50sma. You have to go back at least 41 years for the last time we saw something like this.\n\nHere\u2019s what makes this recent action strange though: The DJIA is currently about 2.5% away from ATHs. Back in 1975, the last time this happened, it was more than 20% away from an ATH.\n\nAnd this is only the 10th time since 1900 the DJIA has ever closed 36 straight days between its 50- and 200-sma's.\n\nTaking a closer look at the 10 times the DJIA went 36 trading days or more between the 50- and 200-sma, the current streak is the closest to the ATH, with many of the other instances taking place in bear markets. In other words -- it's tough to compare now versus then, as the market is behaving much more differently.\n\nI think we can all agree that this lack of volatility will eventually come to an end at some point and we would expect some much higher volatility before the year is out. Of course, the presidential election is the big wildcard and should there be any unexpected outcomes for either Hillary or Trump, a spike in volatility is more likely.", "id": "d9d33ii"}], [{"comment": "Typical pre-election.", "id": "d9d9ksz"}, {"comment": "> Typical pre-election.\n\nHold up there ... are you saying that this sideways market action we are seeing this election year is typical of all election years (specifically the 8th year election years like this year, 2008, 2000, etc...)?\n\nTruth be told here but since 1901 out all the instances that we have had an 8th year of a presidents term ... only once was it up for that 8th year (1988)\n\n* **[SOURCE](https://i.imgur.com/MS6vx0U.jpg)**\n\nThat being said - yes technically election years are typically bullish for the markets as this chart would illustrate-\n\n* **[CLICK HERE](https://i.imgur.com/zxMRZLJ.jpg)**\n\n2016 seems to be following the blue line (all election years) and not the black line (8th year) so you'd be correct\n\nHowever, that could certainly change in a hurry if election outcomes surprise ... and I'm not saying that they will, but then again recall that everyone and their cousins were saying the BREXIT vote would not materialize ... and we saw what ended up happening there.

Some of the high-frequency data, are they confirming the slowdown we saw mid-third quarter, or is that a blip?\" said Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation for BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Trade could be choppy as history shows market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, has surged every October of an election year since 1992, according to quantitative analysis using Kensho.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, says he sees more volatility to the downside than upside right now. He also says the market is ripe for a pullback of 5 percent or so.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"We've probably seen a lot of the gains we'll get this year, and we'll see more ups and downs that will define the fourth quarter more than a passing of one direction or the other,\" Kleintop said.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### U.S. stocks ended a choppy week slightly higher, after falling and rising with oil prices and then Deutsche Bank shares. The S&P 500 closed at 2,168.27 with energy the best-performing sector of the week.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### New York\u2013traded shares of Germany's largest bank hit record lows in the past week on mounting worries about the struggling lender that have evoked concern about another financial crisis. The German government ruled out state aid for the bank as it faces the U.S. Department of Justice's demand for $14 billion in settlement over mortgage bonds. Other media reports in the last two days raised concerns that a handful of funds are less willing to do business with Deutsche Bank. \n> &nbsp;\n> ### But shares rebounded Friday in their best day since 2011 after an AFP report that the bank is close to a $5.4 billion settlement with the DOJ. CNBC has not independently confirmed the report, and there arereasons to be skeptical about the stated number.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"I think just given how depressed the name has been in the stock over the last couple weeks, you're getting a huge reaction in the stock on headlines either way,\" said Drew Forman, co-head of trading at Macro Risk Advisors.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Investors will be watching for any incremental developments on Deutsche Bank over the weekend, which is a three-day one in Germany since Monday is a holiday.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"I don't see any over-the-weekend rescue looming for Deutsche Bank,\" said Holger Mertens, head portfolio manager, global credit, at Nikko Asset Management. \"What has to change here is the perception of the bank that is out there.\"\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Another issue for markets to eye over the weekend is the official inclusion of the Chinese yuan as the fifth currency in the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket. The inclusion increases the attractiveness of the yuan, also known as the RMB, as an international reserve asset that central banks can readily use.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"The RMB joins the SDR formally on Oct 1. Some people would argue that ahead of the formal entry, they've been bending over backwards to keep the currency stable so afterwards, they might have less of a reason to keep it stable,\" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Traders have watched the currency since surprise devaluations last August shocked global markets with concerns of negative spillover from a sharp slowdown in China's economy.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### China's markets are closed next week for a national holiday, and barring significant developments around European banks, strategists generally expect U.S. markets to focus on domestic news. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the September ISM manufacturing due Monday to show 50.3 after a 49.4 print for the prior month.

During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in point and percentage terms. It is no wonder that the term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month.\n\n> But October has also been a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. This year is neither a midterm year nor is a bear market in progress, thus October\u2019s performance in past election years is of greater importance.\n\n> Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&P 500 (since 1952), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). NASDAQ fairs slightly better, with October being the second worst month in election years since 1972. Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/7dbb443ca809acf26d7e3b72681eb76a/tumblr_inline_oe6nhmMseW1spdppr_400.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: October\u2019s First Trading Day a Mixed Bag\"**\n> Based upon data in the soon to be available 50th Anniversary Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac for 2017 on page 86, the first trading day of October is the fourth weakest of all monthly first trading days since September 1997. Only September, August and June have been weaker. S&P 500 has been down 10 of the last 21 years on the first trading day of October.

I built a website for trading with my Robinhood account on the desktop, and was testing it live on YouTube during the last couple weeks. \n\nI see you recently started a YouTube channel and have almost no views. I'm guessing you're asking this question because you're wondering if you'll get a bigger audience trading stocks live. \n\nI didn't advertise my streams, I just titled it properly, with a description and relevant tags. I also had no subscribers, so the only way people would find it is by browsing YouTube.\n\nI can tell you that in my experience, almost all of the time I was streaming for 0 viewers. At most there were a handful of viewers in a session, but each one didn't watch for long. \n\nI kept the chat window open so I might see questions and respond, thinking I could demonstrate the software and promote my product. But it was always empty. \n\nI did a search for other live trading on YouTube, and they didn't have many viewers either. \n\nYou really need a purpose for what you produce, that has a very clear value for people to instantly recognize. The people live trading with more views would be the ones claiming to be millionaires, trading using more money than the audience would see in their lifetime, promising to teach an easy program to get rich quick. Then the naive will flock because they perceive value, even if it's a scam. \n\nYou also need to build an audience through advertising and relationships. These mediums online provide a market with many people, but you still have to do actual marketing or no one will show up and stay. Marketing is all about designing utility, communicating value, and distributing to those who need what you produce. \n\nIf you don't have a real specific purpose for your videos, and aren't interested in spending years slowly building up an audience for what you like to produce, then you should probably find a different hobby or business. If your goal is general like \"get rich\" or \"be famous\" then neither of those will happen because you have no map and destination so you're wandering aimlessly. \n\nIf I've misinterpreted, and you're not asking for your own channel, and just wanted to know, then yes, and you can drop by if I do it again, but unless you're specifically interested in learning about my software, it'll be boring and you'll leave within minutes.

But also this past year, they've been responsible for:\n\n\n* Adam Sandler's most recent pile of shit ('The Do-Over'), and another, or 2 if we're lucky, future Adam Sandler-movies.\n  \n* Adam Sandler's pile of shit before that, 'The Ridiculous 6'.\n  \n* Ashton Kutcher/Danny Masterson in the worst sitcom since \"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\", 'The Ranch'.\n  \n* Whatever the hell Marseille is supposed to be.\n  \n* Marco Polo (S2) is arguably a less than good show, apart from the actor playing Genghis, and the set/costume design. (Seriously. I've seen two entire seasons of this show and I still don't know if I like it, or just endure it..)\n  \n* Ricky Gervais' Special Correspondents. If you still need convincing Ricky Gervais should just stick to stand-up, this movie'll do it.\n  \n* Will Arnett's Flaked just makes me feel bad for Will Arnett.\n\n  \n\nI'd say they're at least giving stand-up comedians a new platform, but they're just giving new specials to old comedians (not that that's a bad thing, there's just an immense amount of 'yet-to-be-televised' comedy-talent out there).\n\n\n\nOf course, there have been shows I enjoyed this year (Jessica Jones, ao.). This is just a subjective opinion, and more than likely has very little actual effect on the stock price. After all, Netflix is first and foremost a streaming service, not a content producer. \n\n\n\nThe only reason I could see these affect the stock price, is that there used be an 'allure' of quality to a Netflix-produced show, like your first season of House of Cards, and now it's just another production company, with a fair amount of hits and misses.

The role of an exchange is to match buyers and sellers of the security. \n\nSo the trader has his stock, which he bought at $100, and sees the price move on his screen to $102. What has actually happened is that the screen is reflecting the information that comes from the exchange, and at the exchange there is someone who is willing to buy the share for 102 and someone willing to sell the share for 102.\n\nNo one dictates what the price should be, and there is arguably no \"right\" price, it is simply where someone will buy and someone will sell at the same number ", "id": "d41ofvt"}, {"comment": "Another question.

Even if you're a half a second behind, it won't matter...   unless you're dumb enough to buy at the market, in which case yes you could happen to buy right as it jumps 5 or 10 cents. \n\nThis is why you use limit orders.

Sure, sometimes during spikes up or down it will move very rapidly... but for MOST of the time, the 'last' price kinda sits there for at least few seconds... and when its moving around, it's usually with trades at the bid and the ask... so  $102.12  and  $102.13.   You might get a flurry of trades at both prices for several seconds before it suddenly moves up 3 or 4 cents.  \n\nIt does happen occasionally that stuff may be fluctuating wildly, but even then that's usually second to second, AND you'd know it was fluctuating wildly since you'd be witnessing it second-by-second.  It would be extremely rare for a trading period that appears stable and calm with slow lazy movements to suddenly start moving all over the place (except during news releases). \n\nThink of it this way:  you're watching a formula-1 race at the track, and you ask your friend how fast car-42 is moving at that moment. Your friend can look at his charts and say something like \"173mph and increasing\", or if he notices the speed behaving very unstable, he can say \"173mph but fluctuating wildly\". Do you trust his statement on 173? Probably not... its a race car... on a turn they may suddenly lose 10-15mph or more and then regain it immediately thereafter. \n\nThe point is... as a trader, you should be gauging the rate of change, the estimated speed, the movement, but you shouldn't be pinning your hope to any specific price to the penny or for it to stay accurate more than a second or two. The car can speed up, slow down, turn, or crash suddenly at any moment.\n\nThe half second behind you are will rarely matter... even during a spike.

With her victory mostly priced into the market, the initial rally from her win could face downward pressures from the rising US dollar as the Fed would likely raise rates in Dec. following her win. There is nothing much to worry with a Trump win too. The Trump win is being feared for the uncertainty factor and his extreme policies and may lead to an initial sell-off in the markets, however, I believe, it might not lead to a sustained sell off in the markets, as Fed would mostly maintain\u00a0its loose policy. The policy differential, along with a flight to safe havens would lead to dollar weakening against the major currencies, but rising against the EM currencies.

I mean, I did not mean to imply that the banks are being unfairly painted as the responsible parties - they really didn't do themselves any favors throughout the entire ordeal - but it does certainly help laypeople to understand a situation when there is a clear distinction between the antagonist and protagonist. I hate to use this as an example, but the common portrayal of Hitler as the embodiment of evil helps develop an understanding of the motivations behind WWII; however, if WWII is explained as an aggregate of all perspectives, people would lose interest. Realistically, it helps to view the sides as good (Churchill, Stalin, Roosevelt) vs evil (Hitler, Mussolini, the Emperor) but it would be difficult to root for Stalin knowing that he killed more people than Hitler, or to root for Churchill knowing that he allowed a mass famine in India to occur as he viewed Indians as subhuman. \n\nSimilarly with the 2008 crisis, no one wants to root for the banks and no one wants to accept that the crisis was also due to recklessness on the people themselves - who wants to accept blame?

Everyone was acting stupid some out of greed, some out of ignorance. The borrowers borrowed money they couldn't afford but how many of them actually understood the terms of the loan? \n\nYes, the banks were required to give more loans and relax the policies. However, there is a difference in relaxing lending practices and just throwing a loan to whoever wants one. I would bet that they far exceeded the percentage of these required loans.\n\nAll of this is moot though. Making these bad loans would have created a housing crisis eventually but (as pointed out in both the movie and the book) it was the financial instruments created out of these loans that blew up the economy, not the loans themselves. These financial instruments were created by the banks, not the govt. Don't get me wrong, I'm def not for govt keeping their hands in everything but while they may have made banks act more fiscally irresponsible, they didn't require them to act insane. \n\nThe govt can take some of the blame for the housing crisis, as can many other participants.

Figure out how you'll afford it by yourself\". With the shitty loans now forced on the banks, they had no choice but to securitize them and throw them into the tranche system. This is where the blame on credit agencies comes in: instead of algorithmically discerning between mortgages with 100% delinquency rates (I.e loanees with <550 credit rating), they assigned an average rating per tranche, hiding the delinquent loans. After all, there is a huge difference between a 0% and 1% delinquency rate, but when only 1 mortgage out of 100 in a tranche carries a 0% repayment rate, there's almost no way for investors to be aware of it. So yes, the crisis occurred as a result of the derivatives, but the derivatives were necessitated by legislation.", "id": "d1kq0pi"}, {"comment": "I absolutely don't disagree with you in this sense. Because of the legislation we we're eventually going to have a housing crisis. I mean, you can't force poor people to be able to pay for a house, statistically these loans would eventually default. \n\nHowever, it was the derivatives created by the bank that caused the actual collapse. It was the side bets taking place with CDSs that tremendously amplified an already deteriorating product.  These side bets (synthetic CDOs) occurred because there are only so many houses to sell. In 2005 there were only $15b in synthetics issued. A year later it was over $60b. \n\nI totally agree with you that the govt definitely played its part and possibly even that it started this whole thing. However, at some point the banks figured out how to amplify their earnings and took the ball and ran with it. The problem with this is, by amplifying their earnings they also were amplifying their losses in the event everything went south.

You buying stock in SolarCity is exactly what they want you to do which isn't bad. If you have faith in Tesla and you don't mind waiting to see the returns, it's a fun idea. \n\nOverall, investing in Elon's company truly is investing in his word; it's probably more true for them than any other company in recent times. If you believe what Elon says, frankly you should buy as much as you possibly can. If you're a little shaky about it, then buy SolarCity maybe once you've seen the market correct TSLA. We haven't seen that yet and it's pretty obviously useless info right now. TSLA is picking up slack, remember... it's not going to be like buying 200 dollar shares for 20 bucks.

So that's your risk if the deal is completed. If it falls apart your risk is that you are left holding SCTY shares, which sounds like you are ok with, but remember a lot of investors are seeing this deal as essentially a bailout of a failing company, so if the deal doesn't go through I would expect a negative hit to SCTY.

The S&P 500 ended the past week down 1.9 percent at 2,085.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###For months, the market had been pricing in a win by Clinton, and the idea that a Republican controlled Congress would keep her policies in check placated normally Republican Wall Street. Many analysts expect the market to rise several percent in a relief rally if she wins, but it could sell off sharply if the White House goes to Trump.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###\"What happens Monday and Tuesday, who knows? There's this general feeling that on Wednesday, people think it's binary. Trump wins, the market goes down. Hillary wins, the market goes up. It's more nuanced than that,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. \"If Hillary wins, and Democrats take the Senate, if you own health care or financial stocks, you're not going to be happy that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are running the Senate.\"\n> &nbsp;\n> ###There is also some concern that if the election is close, and Trump loses, he might challenge the outcome, creating more uncertainty for markets.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###\"We should all hope the winner, no matter who it is, is clear cut. We don't want to hear about whining losers. We want to elect the person and move on,\" Boockvar said.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###Barclays analysts estimate the S&P 500 could lose as much as 11 to 13 percent if Trump wins, and it faces headwinds of 4 to 5 percent if his probability of winning gets to 50 percent. They based their analysis on market moves and the election odds, after the first presidential debate. They also examined moves after the news of an FBI investigation into Clinton emails, and when Trump won key Republican primaries. PredictIt.org on Friday put the odds of a Trump win at 31 percent and a Clinton win at 74 percent, an improvement of about 6 points for Clinton over Thursday's level.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###Keith Parker, Barclays global equity strategist, said the market may sell off on a Trump victory, but like the period after the U.K. Brexit vote in June, stocks may bounce back as investors focus on the economy and growth. The Fed is also expected to continue to be accommodative, and perhaps not hike rates, as expected in December if markets are turbulent.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###\"I think the real key is equities are all about confidence, and \u2026 my analysis is probably based on Trump's policies toward trade and immigration, which are very much a risk to economic growth, while his other policies on tax and fiscal spending are positive for growth. My clue as a strategist is that I would look to whether we see 'good Trump' or 'bad Trump,'\" said Parker.\n> &nbsp;\n> ###Whether the market would spring back in a 'V,' like it did after Brexit, is not clear. \"I think that really is predicated on Trump's rhetoric and also what you're getting out of the economic data,\" he said. Parker said the market is still not pricing high enough odds of a Trump win, and it could be volatile Monday and Tuesday, ahead of the election results.\n> &nbsp;\n([CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL ARTICLE!](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/04/election-week-could-give-wall-street-a-wild-ride.html))\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://i.imgur.com/or62DPq.png))\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/11/04/20161104_eod16.jpg))\n\n# **Treasuries for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE TREASURIES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/11/04/20161104_eod6.jpg))\n\n# **Currencies for this past week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CURRENCIES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2016/11/04/20161104_eod14.jpg))\n\n# **Bird's Eye View of the Markets on Friday:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL FUTURES MAP FROM FRIDAY!](http://i.imgur.com/CeeBCtx.png))\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](http://i.imgur.com/HEVgwkW.png))\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/bSjCUfY.png))\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/zHeDeuq.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: S&P 500 Extends Losing Daily Losing Streak to 9**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/353a42d01af56007d34e931bc4d22530/tumblr_inline_og4wgkbekb1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n> It looked as though S&P 500 was finally going to end its losing streak at 8 consecutive days until the last hour of trading.

Once the streak ended, S&P 500 generally enjoyed a nice bounce and reversal of trend. This bounce and reversal can be seen in the above chart of S&P 500 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after a losing streak of eight or more consecutive trading days.\n\nIn the following table, S&P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after an eight straight day losing streak appears. 1-month later is somewhat mixed however, the average gain is 1.81%. 3-months after is stronger with S&P 500 up 68.2% of the time averaging 4.5%. 6-months and 1-year later S&P 500 further improved.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/3fbd20aa95bdac09aa6b2182ea22734e/tumblr_inline_og4whsYrfu1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Election Day Seasonality Suggests Market Rally**\n> October did live up to its reputation of being weak in Election years. For S&P 500 October\u2019s 1.9% decline was its second worst monthly performance this year and it was also the third consecutive down month. DJIA has also declined in three straight months. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 suffered the most damage in October, off 2.3% and 4.8% respectively. October\u2019s poor performance in presidential election years has historically been accompanied by an incumbent party loss since 1952 (see page 28 of Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2016). In the following chart the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 16 presidential elections are plotted. \n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/fb0b092f653468acd0dbefd35dbcb5d8/tumblr_inline_ofmjrjTVkF1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n> In the above chart, Election Day is Day 0. Prior to 1984, the market was closed on Presidential Election Days so the close on the day before was used. Since 1984, the close of trading on Election Day was used. Day 26, to the left of \u201c0\u201d was the first trading day of October in 2016. As of today\u2019s close, S&P 500 is suggesting an Incumbent party defeat. It is also noteworthy to observe weakness across all three lines between 10 to 5 Trading days before Election Day and then a rally from right around 5 Trading days before to Election Day.\n\n*****\n\n# **VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis for Week Ending 11.4.16** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUEB7hO45Hc))\n\n# **VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.06.16 - The tone has changed** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgtPOVzJGGg))\n\n# **VIDEO: Nov 4th 2016 Pro market Wrap Free Friday** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LgAnluTJmQ))\n\n# **Earnings Releases due out in this upcoming week ahead:** \n> *$NVDA $VRX $DIS $ACIA $JCP $PCLN $CVS $MEET $PTX $NTES $ARIA $PLUG $CXRX $TASR $ENDP $MGM $OPK $CTSH $OA*\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](http://i.imgur.com/sALKpwT.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you guys watching this weekend?

Lael Brainard, who speaks in Chicago Monday. After the hawkish comments of Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren Friday, traders are watching to see if she will stay firmly in the dovish camp, and as for Thursday's retail sales, it is the most important data the Fed will see before it meets on Sept. 20.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Many economists have been expecting the Fed will stay on the sidelines at its September meeting, and December is viewed as more likely for the Fed's second rate hike in 10 years.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Stocks sold off sharply and bond yields snapped higher Friday, after Rosengren's comments. But Swonk said the market ignored a second Fed speaker, Fed. Gov. Daniel Tarullo, who appeared on CNBC Friday.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"What Rosengren said is nothing new. Rosengren wanted a September rate hike,\" said Swonk. \"We've heard from Dan Tarullo in the inner circle and he's consistent with the view to be more dovish. He's not opposed to a rate hike this year but he would be for December. (The markets) allowed Rosengren to trump Tarullo, and Brainard has an even greater sway in Yellen's inner circle.\"\n > &nbsp;\n> ### Fed Chair Janet Yellen and two other Fed officials viewed as being close to the chair \u2014 New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer \u2014 all pushed the idea during the week of their Jackson Hole conference that the Fed was close to hiking rates, possibly even in September.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### But that was before a disappointing batch of August economic data. August's weaker than expected job growth came in at 151,000, 30,000 below expectations. On top of that, ISM manufacturing showed actual contraction in the sector and ISM non-manufacturing showed a surprise slowing of services sector growth.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### There are other Fed speakers, including Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, both on Monday. \n> &nbsp;\n> ### All of that Fed speak puts the focus on the final pieces of important data ahead of the Fed's September meeting. That would be mainly retail sales, and also the producer price index on Thursday and the consumer price index Friday. Economists have been waiting to see whether the consumer is holding up, after strong consumer spending in the second quarter, but recent weakness in auto sales and ISM service sector activity.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"Retail sales will certainly be important for the Fed. We get industrial production too which is likely to be lousy,\" Swonk said. \"Core retail sales should still be good outside of autos.\" Core sales, excluding auto sales and gasoline, are expected to be up 0.3 percent. Auto sales slowed in August but are still running at a pace greater than 17 million annual sales.\n\n([CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL ARTICLE!](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/09/markets-next-week-fed-speakers-could-give-stocks-another-jolt.html))\n\n*****\n\n## **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://finviz.com/publish/090916/sec_all_w1_171115639.png))\n\n### **Bird's Eye View of the Markets on Friday:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL FUTURES MAP FROM FRIDAY!](http://i.imgur.com/93N3HH8.png))\n\n#### **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](http://i.imgur.com/FNOASht.png))\n\n##### **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n## **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/w0L8eFG.png))\n\n### **U.S. Markets Comparison Chart Year-to-Date:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/RIMVkDf.jpg))\n\n#### **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/eXWf9UW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Stock Trader's Almanac: Market Cracks on Frothy Sentiment**\n\n> It\u2019s no secret that market sentiment has been rather bullish. We are dubious of the constant chatter about all the money on the sidelines. Most of the reports of cash on the sidelines are overblown and fail to capture the fact that for every stock sale someone makes to become more \u201cliquid\u201d there was a buyer that used cash to make the purchase and the net effect on cash balances overall would be zero. As a percentage of total market cap, M2 money supply is lower than at any time since the 1920s \u2014with just one exception: the top of the Internet bubble.\n\n> We have been noting the complacent Equity Only Put/Call Ratio readings and high Investors Intelligence Bullish Advisors % of late and now those numbers have begun to turn the other way as the market has begun to crack. North Korea nuclear shenanigans or Trump\u2019s rise in the polls may be the catalyst, but the bottom line is that folks have gotten cocky about the bull market and we are now in the midst of the September/October Disaster Area and on the threshold of one of the more important Presidential Elections of our time.\nSentiment indicators are contrary by nature. Extreme investor and trader negativity is most prevalent at market lows and is bullish, while excessive optimism is seen near tops when the market is running high. But it is the extreme negativity that has been more indicative of major low points and much closer in proximity on the calendar to the actual low point. As has been the case this year, high bullish readings and low put option buying have been going steady for months.\n\n> To illustrate we have lined up below charts of the DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite since 2006 with the weekly readings of the CBOE Equity Only Put/Call Ratio and the II\u2019s Bullish and Bearish Advisors % as well as the difference between the Bulls and the Bears.\nJust as contrary bullish sentiment has begun to wane and put option buying has begun to rise, the market has suffered its biggest one-day move since July 8 and also the first 1% move since that day and it\u2019s to the downside. With Triple Witching next week and the treacherous season upon us, caution is clearly in order at the moment.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/48ae4a67c8b8df4a49b5d118156fd7ff/tumblr_inline_od97a4JJMX1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/2a1ae5c194757ff080452b864e5ed54f/tumblr_inline_od97b1WGcw1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/2a1ae5c194757ff080452b864e5ed54f/tumblr_inline_od97b1WGcw1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **Stock Market Technical Analysis Video for Week Ending 9.9.16** \n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhljtlaEpH4))\n\n# **ER due out in this upcoming week ahead:** \n\n> *$ORCL $CBRL $MANU $UNFI $AGTC $USAT $GMS $APOG $FARM $PSDV $APIC $ASPU*\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](http://i.imgur.com/CM7yT4B.jpg))\n\n*****\n\nDISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you guys looking at this weekend?

Apple is primarily in the business of consumer devices.  That means that their path forward is sure to be very different from that of Google or Microsoft; it's logical for Microsoft to develop AI whereas it's not as obvious for Apple just as Apple relies on third party search providers.\n\nSecond, I think there is a big omission where it would be natural for Apple to enter the market: VR.  VR is one part software, one part content marketplace, one part hardware.  This is exactly what Apple has done so well in the past with the iPod and iTunes, iPhone and the app store, iPad and the app store, etc.  It is surprising that there hasn't been much of a peep from Apple with regards to VR or AR, which would seem to be a huge driver of next generation devices.  \n\nMaybe they are waiting for the technology to mature?

At the levels of parity that we've reached now with regards to feature, function, and even design across \"flagship\" phones, it's incredibly difficult to innovate without multiple fields of science making an equally large leaps.\n\nThis is why the absence of Apple from the VR scene is so puzzling to me since it's one area that really seems to hit their sweetspot.

Facebook is betting big on this space.  Multiple hardware and device makers are jumping in including GoPro, Nokia, and Samsung.  Even Microsoft is dabbling (albeit in AR) with Hololens.  But it also kind of fits Apple's modus operandi; they were not the first MP3 player, they were not the first smartphone, they were not the first tablet, but they were the first to put all the pieces together - hardware, software, marketplace, marketing, design.", "id": "d3guv1w"}, {"comment": "Do you see a lot of daily practical applications for VR?

The Fed is expected to hold off on an interest rate hike until December, though more members of the Federal Open Market Committee clearly favor raising rates, so the Fed forecast on both rates and the economy will be important.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"I don't think they're going to go, particularly given the recent data that's been softer. I think they're going to wait until December,\" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer, global fixed income at BlackRock.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"Markets today are pricing in about an 18 percent chance that they go. But they're also pricing in December at 50 percent. I think December is higher than that. I think it's a 60 to 65 percent chance. I think they want to go.\"\n> &nbsp;\n> ### But the Bank of Japan is another story, and it's expected to take some action, which will be announced in the early morning hours of Wednesday. Speculation points to a possible interest rate cut deeper into negative territory, tweaks to its assets purchase program or new rules on the duration of securities it will purchase in the bond market.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"I think the Bank of Japan is very important. They could change the amount [they purchase] to a range. I think people could view that as tapering, which I don't think they're going to do,\" said Rieder. He said the BOJ could stop buying bonds at the long end of the yield curve, which means long end rates could rise while shorter term rates remain negative.\n> &nbsp;\n([CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL ARTICLE!](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/16/if-youre-watching-the-fed-you-better-pay-attention-to-this-instead.html))\n\n*****\n\n## **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://i.imgur.com/wLQXlFn.png))\n\n### **Bird's Eye View of the Markets on Friday:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL FUTURES MAP FROM FRIDAY!](http://i.imgur.com/NUrV2zf.png))\n\n#### **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](http://i.imgur.com/PLd7E5h.png))\n\n##### **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n## **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/S1a3h9z.png))\n\n### **U.S. Markets Comparison Chart 3-Month:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/JjNHRFa.png))\n\n#### **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/700com3.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Stock Trader's Almanac: Market Pattern Setup for a Fall Correction**\n\n> So I guess that\u2019s the end of our low volatility period. As we pointed out last week the end of lengthy streaks of low volatility can be damaging to market performance. After not having an S&P 500 daily move greater than +/- 1% for 43 trading days since July 8th, we have had 4 in the last 5 days.\n\n> This recent volatility is highlighted in the yellow oval in the chart below of the Three Peaks and a Domed House Top pattern (3PDH) we have been tracking since June, which was re-plotted a month later in July. Previous clusters of this sort of volatility on the chart are associated with corrections.\n\n> I am not convinced we will get all the way back to the 3PDH Separating Decline low at points 10-14 at this juncture, but the Brexit lows could be in play over the next several weeks.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_1016_20160915_3PDH.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **Stock Trader's Almanac: S&P 500 down 22 of 26 during week after September options expiration, average loss 1.08%**\n\n> Consistent with a rise in volatility in September, the week after options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines especially since 1990. The week after September options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 26 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just three times: 1998, 2002 and 2010 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.\n\n> Full stats are in the following sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA \u20131.15%, S&P 500 \u20131.08%, NASDAQ \u20131.07% and a whopping \u20131.65% for Russell 2000.

Remember the chemical reactions in your that occur during risk/reward are in some way screwing with your thought processes.\n\nAnother piece of advice I picked up is that don't bother trying to predict the market highs and lows, a lot of people who are a lot smarter than any of us have tried and failed, consistently, for decades. \n\nSo what if you sell a month or two too early, if your upside is 5% and your downside risk is 15% the only thing you have done is mitigate risk. \n\nThe absolute best strategy to make money is to not be in equities during a downturn. You've made your money, you foresee a downturn coming, don't get greedy.\n\nAs another poster said, you might want to keep a few speculative shares around for awhile. That's not a bad idea, but mentally I would look at those remaining shares as though they've already lost a good chunk of their value. At the end of the day everything we do is risk vs. reward.

In economics, when you open up trade between two separate economies, the combined value of the economies grows due to efficiencies created by trade. This is often described as a pie. The economies may not keep their share of the pie, but the size of the overall pie grows. This growth in the pie is your $3 trillion. And it comes from trade efficiency and trade stability.\n\nNow that Britain left the EU, the pie shrunk on a scale of $3 trillion. In a microeconomic sense, imagine that you have country A and country B. Country A makes cars at a cost of $10000 and country B makes cars at a cost of $30000. The citizens of country A together are willing to spend a combined $200000 on cars and the citizens of country B are willing to spend a combined $300000 on cars. If the countries do not trade, country A will purchase 20 cars and country B will purchase 10 cars. If the countries *do* trade, country A will purchase 20 cars, but country B can purchase 30 cars. When the countries do not trade, the world has 30 cars, but when the countries do trade, the world can purchase 50 cars. Let's say that country B still only buys 10 cars. Country B will now have $200000 left over. This can be spent on other things, and we can say that trade increased wealth by $200000. Now pretend that the countries stop trading. The world would eventually go back to having 30 cars with no surplus money once the current cars need to be replaced.\n\nDoes it make sense now how trade can create wealth?

This scenario would be called a Perfect System, where all economic factors can be held constant.

Currency values are representative of the purchase power across all industries, not just one, so one country producing cars cheaper than the other will likely not adjust currency values to where they balance out. I used dollars in my simple example because if you convert all currency values into dollars, you can easily see the trade value.\n\nSo essentially you are right that a lot of the $3 trillion is a hesitance to invest, however it also derives from speculation from future losses to trade efficiency.", "id": "d4sk3gl"}, {"comment": "thanks. i appreciated your further explanation on this subject. and it makes sense to me that investors were reluctant to invest, so the market lost significant amount of cash.

So you have not lost any money right now if you didn't have investments, but you would have if you invested because the investments are partially valued based on expected profits, and those will likely decrease.\n\nIf you live in Britain, your purchasing power will decrease since many things will likely become more expensive. So your standard of living will likely decrease, making British citizens seem as if they have lost money. There are other factors that play into this, though, so there is also a chance that the British citizens see a greater standard of living. If the British do see a greater standard of living in the long run, it is likely that their previous trade partners will be worse off in the long run.

Some people think this will be bad for Britain, others bad for the EU. In any case, all this uncertainty and renegotiations will probably slow trade by quite a bit.\n\nCompanies make money from their transactions, and many companies deal with Britain and/or the EU. Their stocks are valued by how much transactions they do now and by how much they are estimated to do in the future, which may lead to dividends being cut or not offered.

You're right that short-term ones could very well be retrained regularly. But the re-training also introduces more potential for things to go haywire, as opposed to algorithms that have known behavior.

But I'd assume most algos would at the very least put some weighting to the more recent time samples than the later ones. The problem with the 8 year crash cycle you pointed out is that I feel like we dont have enough data to determine if this is truly a trend. If we think of the 8year time period as a frequency (1cycle/8years), and we assume that our algorithm has access to roughly 100 years of tick data if we are lucky, then this is only about 13 cycles of data. Its hard to make predictions about whats going to happen next since we don't have enough samplings of this 8 year oscillation (if it truly is an oscillation in the first place). ML can certainly do amazing things, but I would be hesitant to believe any algorithms that can make predictions 8 years in advance. ", "id": "d29epec"}, {"comment": ">  I feel like we dont have enough data to determine if this is truly a trend.\n\nThis is precisely my point. We don't know. We want the algos to figure that out for us ideally, but we only have past data to train them from, and the algorithm-generation techniques used are not that complex compared to the complexity of the market itself. \n\nI see it as inevitable that, averaged across all algorithms applied, the future behavior will end up mimicking the market's past behavior, and therefore a 2008-like event is basically baked in the cake. \n\nIf it's true though that the most-used algorithms just look across 5 minute windows, then even still they will have likely been exposed to a condition like Oct 2008 as part of their training data, and know not to buy during it because it might last months. So if those same extreme downward conditions become evident, even if by natural chance, it creates a feedback loop of \"don't buy/sell\" behavior, that drives the market downward. I imagine this keeps going (with some up and down bumps along the way) until the long-term behavior sees that it's low enough to be worth buying again, and then it will begin the slow climb upward over the next few years. \n\nI'm not saying it's a 100% thing by _any_ means, but it does seem like what will happen to me based on what I know about machine learning, HFT company behavior, and stock market behavior.

We want the algos to figure that out for us ideally, but we only have past data to train them from\n\nMy argument with 8 year cycle has more to do with undersampling of data of low frequency oscillations. No matter what algorithm we use, we can never overcome this undersampling, and thus I would never trust an algorithm that makes 8 year predictions, simply because there is no training set in existence that has enough data to make strong predictions.

Wouldn't the companies want their algos to know about the past crashes, as to be able to react to them?
